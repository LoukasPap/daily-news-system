Jonathan Franklin,"A Chicago woman is accusing American Airlines of racial discrimination after one of its flight attendants allegedly confronted her after she used   the plane's first-class lavatory.In a complaint sent to American Airlines and obtained by NPR, Pamela Hill-Veal, who is Black, said that while she and her family were flying first class on Feb. 10, from Chicago to Phoenix, one of the flight attendants stopped her as she returned to her seat  —  and accused Hill-Veal of slamming the restroom door.Following the remarks of the flight attendant (whose name and race were not identified   in the complaint), Hill-Veal said she did not respond as she proceeded to walk back to her seat.""The flight attendant stopped me as I was returning to my seat and told me I 'slammed the restroom door and I was not to do it again since passengers were sleeping on the plane,'"" Hill-Veal said in an interview with NPR. She said she never slammed the door.A while later on the flight, Hill-Veal — a retired circuit court judge   in Illinois — said in the complaint that she used the same restroom in first class, as the same flight attendant stopped her again.In a statement to NPR, American Airlines said the company has been in contact with Hill-Veal to learn more about her experience. ""We strive to ensure that every customer has a positive travel experience, and we take all claims of discrimination very seriously,"" the airline said.Hill-Veal told NPR that she vividly remembers the moment the flight attendant began to reprimand her.""He began to berate me by pointing his finger at me towards my face and saying, 'I told you not to slam the door ... so from now on, you are to use the restroom in the back of the plane' while he pointed in the direction of the restroom in coach,"" she said.Hill-Veal says that while she did not witness any passengers in first class complain about the restroom door, more attention was drawn to her after her hostile interaction with the flight attendant.  She said she believes the incident was racially motivated, noting that other passengers, who were white, used the same first-class restroom and were not told to use the one in the back of the plane.The flight attendant ""was pointing his finger at me and said again, 'I told you to stop slamming the door...,' "" she said.Hill-Veal says that about 30 minutes prior to landing, she used the restroom for a third time. Once she was leaving, the same flight attendant followed her to her seat and began to physically touch her and explain that she would be arrested upon the flight landing.In the complaint, the former judge said the flight attendant told her   she would be arrested because he ""didn't like the way [she] talked to him,"" and accused Hill-Veal of hitting him.""This was a complete fabrication as I told him that I never hit him,"" she added.Hill-Veal says that since   the incident, she hasn't been able to properly sleep given the trauma she experienced and the incident has left her feeling humiliated.""I'm still uncomfortable about flying because I don't know what they're going to say that I did ... in an attempt to cover up for what they did during this particular time,"" Hill-Veal said.<h2>Other discrimination complaints against American Airlines</h2>American Airlines is no stranger to discrimination accusations. In 2023, the company was targeted after two separate incidents — one involving  track star Sha'Carri Richardson  and  another with musician David Ryan Harris  — made headlines.Richardson was forced off her American flight following an argument with a flight attendant who said the athlete was harassing her and trying to intimidate her, Axios  reported .In a statement similar to the one given to NPR about the allegations made by Hill-Veal, the airline told Axios that it investigates all claims of discrimination, adding, ""American Airlines strives to provide a positive and welcoming experience to everyone who travels with us and we take allegations of discrimination very seriously.""In September, Harris, who was traveling with his two biracial children, was  stopped and questioned  at Los Angeles International Airport after an American Airlines flight attendant suspected he was trafficking the children.Harris later  posted a statement  he says was given to him by American: ""we and our flight attendant realized that our policies regarding suspected human trafficking were not followed, and through coaching and counseling ... our flight attendant realizes that their interaction and observations did NOT meet the criteria that human trafficking was taking place.""",business,2024-04-25 12:02:00 PM EEST,NPR,American Airlines passenger alleges discrimination over use of first-class restroom,https://www.npr.org/2024/04/25/1245583048/american-airlines-racial-discrimination-allegation-bathroom
None,"More than 60 years ago, policymakers in Colorado embraced the idea that early intervention could prevent child abuse and save lives. The state's requirement that certain professionals tell officials when they suspect a child has been abused or neglected was among the first mandatory reporting laws in the nation.Since then, mandatory reporting laws have expanded nationally to include more types of maltreatment — including neglect, which now accounts for most reports — and have increased the number of professions required to report. In some states,  all adults  are required to report what they suspect may be abuse or neglect.But now there are efforts in Colorado and other states – including  New York  and  California  — to roll back these laws, saying the result has been too many unfounded reports, and that they disproportionately harm families that are poor, Black, or Indigenous, or have members with disabilities.""There's a long, depressing history based on the approach that our primary response to a struggling family is reporting,"" says Mical Raz, a physician and historian at the University of Rochester in New York. ""There's now a wealth of evidence that demonstrates that more reporting is not associated with better outcomes for children.""<h2>Seeking balance</h2>Stephanie Villafuerte, Colorado's child protection ombudsman, oversees a task force to reexamine the state's mandatory reporting laws. She says the group is seeking to balance a need to report legitimate cases of abuse and neglect with a desire to weed out inappropriate reports.""This is designed to help individuals who are disproportionately impacted,"" Villafuerte says. ""I'm hoping it's the combination of these efforts that could make a difference.""Some critics worry that changes to the law could result in missed cases of abuse. Medical and child care workers on the task force have expressed concern about legal liability. While it's rare for people to be criminally charged for failure to report, they can also face civil liability or professional repercussions, including threats to their licenses.Being reported to child protective services is becoming increasingly common. More than 1 in 3 children in the United States will be the subject of a child abuse and neglect investigation by the time they turn 18, according to the most frequently cited estimate, a  2017 study  funded by the Department of Health and Human Services' Children's Bureau.Black and Native American families, poor families, and  parents  or  children  with disabilities experience even more oversight. Research has found that, among these groups, parents are more likely to lose parental rights and children are more likely to wind up in foster care.In an  overwhelming majority  of investigations, no abuse or neglect is substantiated. Nonetheless, researchers who study  how these investigations affect families  describe them as terrifying and isolating.In Colorado, the number of child abuse and neglect reports has increased 42% in the past decade and reached a record 117,762 last year, according to  state data . Roughly 100,000 other calls to the hotline weren't counted as reports because they were requests for information or were about matters like child support or adult protection, say officials from the Colorado Department of Human Services.<h2>No surge in substantiated cases of abuse</h2>The increase in reports can be traced to a policy of encouraging a broad array of professionals — including school and medical staff, therapists, coaches, clergy members, firefighters, veterinarians, dentists, and social workers — to call a hotline whenever they have a concern.These calls don't reflect a surge in mistreatment. More than two-thirds of the reports received by agencies in Colorado don't meet the threshold for investigation. Of the children whose cases are assessed, 21% are found to have experienced abuse or neglect. The actual  number of substantiated cases  has not risen over the past decade.While studies do not demonstrate that mandatory reporting laws keep children safe, the Colorado task force  reported in January , there is evidence of harm. ""Mandatory reporting disproportionately impacts families of color"" — initiating contact between child protection services and families who routinely do not present concerns of abuse or neglect, the task force said.The task force says it is analyzing whether better screening might mitigate ""the disproportionate impact of mandatory reporting on under-resourced communities, communities of color and persons with disabilities.""The task force pointed out that the only way to report concerns about a child is with a formal report to a hotline. Yet many of those calls are not to report abuse at all but rather attempts to connect children and families with resources like food or housing assistance.Hotline callers may mean to help, but the families who are the subjects of mistaken reports of abuse and neglect rarely see it that way.That includes Meighen Lovelace, a rural Colorado resident who asked KFF Health News not to disclose their hometown for fear of attracting unwanted attention from local officials. For Lovelace's daughter, who is neurodivergent and has physical disabilities, the reports started when she entered preschool at age 4 in 2015. The teachers and medical providers making the reports frequently suggested that the county human services agency could assist Lovelace's family. But the investigations that followed were invasive and traumatic.""Our biggest looming fear is, 'Are you going to take our children away?'"" says Lovelace, who is an advocate for the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition, an organization that lobbies for the civil rights of people with disabilities. ""We're afraid to ask for help. It's keeping us from entering services because of the fear of child welfare.""State and county human services officials said they could not comment on specific cases.<h2>A 'warmline' to connect families to services</h2>The Colorado task force plans to suggest clarifying the definitions of abuse and neglect under the state's mandatory reporting statute. Mandatory reporters should not ""make a report solely due to a family/child's race, class or gender,"" nor because of inadequate housing, furnishings, income or clothing. Also, there should not be a report based solely on the ""disability status of the minor, parent or guardian,"" according to the group's draft recommendation.The task force plans to recommend additional training for mandatory reporters, help for professionals who are deciding whether to make a call, and an alternative phone number, or ""warmline,"" for cases in which callers believe a family needs material assistance, rather than surveillance.Critics say such changes could leave more children vulnerable to unreported abuse.""I'm concerned about adding systems such as the warmline, that kids who are in real danger are going to slip through the cracks and not be helped,"" says Hollynd Hoskins, an attorney who represents victims of child abuse. Hoskins has sued professionals who fail to report their suspicions.The Colorado task force includes health and education officials, prosecutors, victim advocates, county child welfare representatives and attorneys, as well as five people who have experience in the child welfare system. It intends to finalize its recommendations by early next year in the hope that state legislators will consider policy changes in 2025. Implementation of any new laws could take several years.Other places have recently considered changes to restrain, rather than expand, reporting of abuse. In New York City, teachers are being trained to  think twice  before making a report, while New York state  introduced a warmline  to help connect families with resources like housing and child care. In California, a state  task force  aimed at shifting ""mandated reporting to community supporting"" is planning recommendations  similar to Colorado's .Among those advocating for change are people with experience in the child welfare system. They include  Maleeka Jihad , who leads the Denver-based MJCF Coalition, which advocates for the abolition of mandatory reporting along with the rest of the child welfare system, citing its damage to Black, Native American, and Latino communities.""Mandatory reporting is another form of keeping us policed and surveillanced by whiteness,"" says Jihad, who as a child was taken from the care of a loving parent and placed temporarily into the foster system. Reform isn't enough, she says. ""We know what we need, and it's usually funding and resources.""Some of these resources — like affordable housing and child care — don't exist at a level sufficient for all the Colorado families that need them, Jihad says.Other services are out there, but it's a matter of finding them. Lovelace says the reports ebbed after the family got the help it needed, in the form of a Medicaid waiver that paid for specialized care for their daughter's disabilities. Their daughter is now in seventh grade and doing well.None of the caseworkers who visited the family ever mentioned the waiver, Lovelace says. ""I really think they didn't know about it.""KFF Health News  is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at  KFF  — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.",health,2024-04-25 14:00:00 PM EEST,NPR,States find a downside to mandatory reporting laws meant to protect children,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/04/25/1247021109/states-find-a-downside-to-mandatory-reporting-laws-meant-to-protect-children
Anastasia Tsioulcas,"Editor's note:  This report includes descriptions of sexual assault.On Thursday morning, the highest court in New York state overturned the  2020 felony sex crime conviction  of former movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, and ordered a new trial. Weinstein has been serving a  23-year sentence in New York  on the basis of that conviction. The Manhattan district attorney's office told NPR it intends to retry the case.The New York State Court of Appeals found in a 4-3 decision that Weinstein had not received a fair trial, in part because the trial judge allowed testimony from women whose allegations were not part of that case. (In all, more than 100 women made public allegations against Weinstein.)On behalf of the majority, Judge Jenny Rivera wrote in part in the ruling: ""We conclude that the trial court erroneously admitted testimony of uncharged, alleged prior sexual acts against persons other than the complainants of the underlying crimes because that testimony served no material non-propensity purpose... The only evidence against defendent [Weinstein] was the complainants' testimony, and the result of the court's rulings ... was to bolster their credibility and diminish defendant's character before the jury.""It will now be up to the Manhattan district attorney,  Alvin Bragg Jr. , to launch a new trial against Weinstein. Bragg is currently involved in another very high-profile case: the New York trial of former president Donald Trump, who has been charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. A spokesperson for the DA's office told NPR Thursday in a written statement: ""We will do everything in our power to retry this case, and remain steadfast in our commitment to survivors of sexual assault.""Despite the New York court's decision, another conviction against Weinstein stands for now. In Feb. 2023, a judge in Los Angeles sentenced Weinstein to a  16-year prison term  on a separate conviction of rape and sexual assault. That sentence is to be served consecutively after the New York prison term. As of Thursday morning, Weinstein was being held in upstate New York, at the Mohawk Correctional Facility.",entertainment,2024-04-25 17:58:00 PM EEST,NPR,Harvey Weinstein's 2020 sex crimes conviction in New York overturned,https://www.npr.org/2024/04/25/1247131054/harvey-weinsteins-2020-sex-crimes-conviction-in-new-york-overturned
None,"WASHINGTON — Tears cascaded down Caleb Williams' face. The then-9 year old couldn't believe the mistake he made.Williams was starting his first game at quarterback for the Bowie Bulldogs in Maryland. He'd previously played running back and linebacker in the three years leading up to this moment.But after Mark McCain saw Williams throw a 40-yard pass on the dot ... as his team's third-string quarterback the season before, McCain, Russell Thomas and Carl Williams, Caleb's father, agreed to try the fourth grader at signal caller.So here was Williams, in his first contest – a 7-v-7 game – and his first throw was an interception.He attempted a 15-yard pass but made the wrong read. He disregarded what he saw the defense had set-up, and paid for it immediately.""Since I was 4, when I lost, I cried,""  Williams told The Pivot Podcast . ""One thing about me is my guys know I care ... and winning is the most important thing to me. ... There is a time and a place for it and understanding, even if it's raw emotion, and it comes out then and there, but being able to control it and hold it in until you get home.""His tears, the frustration with himself and that initial failure weren't for naught, though. In fact, those mistakes proved to be invaluable. This was the first pivotal moment in Williams' development at quarterback.<h2>The legend begins</h2>The second happened three years later. He was then playing for Bowie Elite, a youth football program. McCain, his new coach, benched Williams during the team's playoff game after he went the wrong direction on a handoff, fumbled a snap and didn't throw to the right places.It was after that game when Williams, the presumptive No. 1-overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, flipped the switch and altered the trajectory of his career. It's also where Williams' legend actually begins.""That really kind of started that; when he realized that it was deeper than just going out running routes and seeing who was open,"" McCain, who co-owns  the Athletic Republic  with Thomas and Carl Williams, told NPR. ""It changed his vision of the game.""""There was a switch [between seventh and eighth grade] where that energy that he was taking – when he was upset with losing – the switch kind of made him, somehow [take] away the uncontrollable emotion. All of a sudden he didn't feel pressure anymore. He just kind of seized the moment.""<h2>Williams' path to the NFL Draft</h2>The start of Williams' ascent doesn't begin with winning the starting job as a freshman at Gonzaga College High School in 2017.Nor when he helped the Eagles erase a 20-point deficit and tossed a 53-yard Hail Mary to cap Gonzaga's improbable win in the 2018 Washington Catholic Athletic Conference final.Or when he led the  Oklahoma Sooners to an unfathomable 55-48 comeback  victory over Texas Longhorns in 2021 as a true freshman and playing only half of the contest.These moments occurred because those first two experiences taught him exactly what it would take to master the position, and Williams hasn't looked back since those initial growing pains.""I worked with the Baltimore Ravens, Ray Lewis, Ed Reed,"" McCain said. ""None of them have that competitive drive that [William's] has. ... It's unmatched. He simply does not compute losing. He doesn't accept failure at all.""Going into high school, he would want to watch film of the game right after. He didn't wanna wait until Monday or Tuesday or talk. He wanted to immediately...see the things that he could have done better and figure out how to do them better. ... That's really how he developed his game. Doing something, seeing himself doing it and working on that thing until [he] couldn't do it wrong. ... And then he'd keep building on it.""These are a few of the reasons NFL experts anticipate that when the Chicago Bears put in the selection for the opening pick on Thursday, William's name is the one that'll be read off the card.Williams, 22, has shown an uncanny ability to not only elevate his game, no matter the circumstances, but also the players around him, too.The latter part frequently contributed to  Elijah Brook's decision  to award Williams the most valuable player honor all four years he participated in his camp. The former coach at powerhouse DeMatha Catholic High School met Williams in fifth grade as one of his campers.Williams' desire to lead, always go first – even as one of the youngest players – and penchant to absorb criticism stood out to Brooks, who now coaches running backs for Virginia Tech.In due time, Brooks expected Williams to be a problem.<h2>One coach's loss, another's gain</h2>""He was a leader,"" Brooks said. ""He was physically dominant. He was popular amongst the campers. From a very early age, he just separated himself from the pack as special. I'm a firm believer that some kids just have the 'it' factor, and it was easy to see that he had that at a very early age.""To this day, that was probably my biggest recruiting loss.""And it worked out to be Randy Trivers' massive gain.When his high school coach was asked how Williams got on his radar, Trivers responded with a better question.""It's not so much as how did he get on your radar, as how could he not be on anybody's radar really?"" Trivers said.By the time Trivers met Williams, he was an advanced quarterback prospect. Williams expressed a desire to attend a high school with a strong football program and academics, but also where he would develop as an overall person.Trivers never promised Williams the starting gig if he came to Gonzaga, but the 10-year coach of the Eagles did promise Williams would receive a fair opportunity to compete for it.And that was all Williams ever needed – a shot.Once Williams was finally on the team, Trivers observed how the freshman quickly bought into  Gonzaga's motto of ""Men for Others ,"" and won over his new teammates with his work ethic, charisma and selflessness.""'Men for Others,' it's like living a Christ-like life [and] doing things that are not necessarily for you and yourself, but for others,"" Trivers said. ""So, living your best life for you, your family, your friends, your teammates, your classmates, your community.""Williams endeared himself to his new teammates, Trivers and former teammate Trey Jamison said. He was the first on the field, and the last to leave. Williams studied furiously. When a teammate made a mistake, Williams didn't shy away from him on the next play. Oftentimes, he showed his faith in them by going back to the player.His teammates then rewarded him by lobbying for him to start.Jamison, a linebacker for the U.S. Naval Academy , still incorporates a lesson Williams taught him when they were 14 years old. When one makes a mistake, use positive self-talk. Williams eliminated negative outbursts and emotional responses following the benching.Instead, Jamison said, Williams was frequently heard saying, ""C'mon, Caleb,"" after a bad play or refocusing by dribbling the football like a basketball off the turf.""He got good at that, and it made me want to do that, too,"" Jamison said. ""It definitely helps out. It's something I use to this day, if it's something with school, mentally, or to get through [something.]""Even when Gonzaga faced a third-and-33, and Williams had to play the final minute of the game with an injured foot, he didn't waver.Instead, he responded with a 50-yard completion and then an 11-yard touchdown. With just 29 seconds left, Gonzaga had its first lead. But it didn't last.  Their opponent, DeMatha, scored on the ensuing kickoff .What happened next spoke volumes to McCain about Williams' response.""Russell was sitting right beside me, I said, 'He's about to be legendary.' I could see how cool he was,"" McCain said after seeing William's composure.Remember that pass Williams threw at age 9, that was intercepted? Fool Williams once, shame on him. This time, Williams completed a 13-yard throw to set up the ensuing Hail Mary with four ticks left.""The only thing I said to my offensive coordinator was get me in range,"" Williams told The Pivot Podcast. ""Once I was in range, I felt like the game was over. ... It was the craziest game ever.""The rest was history. Williams heaved the ball to the back of the end zone. In between four defenders, his receiver caught the toss. On his 16th birthday, Williams threw three touchdowns, rushed for two more and even caught a touchdown – to help the Eagles win their first WCAC title since 2002.Jamison couldn't watch. Trivers was nearly brought to tears.""Those [referee's] hands go up, and I collapsed on the field right there,"" Trivers recalled.Brooks said his heart dropped.""That was my last high school game, so thank you, Caleb,"" Brooks said with a laugh. ""I appreciate you for that.""That experience in the WCAC championship was a building block for Williams three years later. When former Sooners coach Lincoln Riley inserted him into the game facing a 35-17 deficit, Williams didn't wilt, because he'd been through the fire before.<h2>'The Caleb era has just begun'</h2>""When they put him in, I said, 'The Caleb era has just begun. He's never coming back out, ever,'"" McCain said. ""And he went on to win that game.""Going to a program like the Sooners, with not only an incumbent, but one that has preseason-Heisman hype, too, and saying, ""I can do this,"" takes a certain confidence. And that's what makes Williams unique.While others kept tabs of where players at their position were committing, Williams didn't, McCain said. It wasn't a factor in his decision making at all. Williams wanted to be coached by Riley. When Riley became coach at the University of Southern California, Williams knew he had to go with him. So he transferred and never looked back.Now, Williams gets to look forward to hearing his name called Thursday at the NFL Draft in Detroit.""I am never shocked at anything he does,"" Brooks said. ""I'm on record, he goes and wins MVP of the league or leads Chicago to a Super Bowl or what have you, it is not going to surprise me at all.""Some people just have it, and they were born with it. And listen, he works tirelessly on his craft, so when you can combine all of those factors, that's what you get. So whether it is him leading a comeback at Oklahoma or him winning the Heisman or him getting drafted No. 1 or winning his high school championship on the Hail Mary, I ain't surprised at all.""",sports,2024-04-25 12:00:00 PM EEST,NPR,"Caleb Williams, likely top NFL draft pick, traces success to an interception at age 9",https://www.npr.org/2024/04/25/1246815390/caleb-williams-nfl-2024-draft-chicago-bears
Nina Totenberg,"A genuinely historic event takes place at the Supreme Court on Thursday. The justices hear arguments on  Donald Trump's claim that he is immune  from prosecution after leaving office for any of his official acts while he was president. Specifically, Trump claims that the steps he took to block the certification of Joe Biden's election were part of his official duties and that he thus cannot be criminally prosecuted.The question of presidential immunity from criminal prosecution after leaving office has never been decided by the Supreme Court.NPR special live coverage begins just ahead of the 10 a.m. Supreme Court hearing. Click on the player below to listen or  tune in on the NPR app . President Richard Nixon, while in office, was named an unindicted co-conspirator in the Watergate scandal, but he was not prosecuted then because the Justice Department concluded that under the Constitution, a sitting president could not be criminally prosecuted. Once Nixon resigned in 1974, however, and was no longer protected as a sitting president, he accepted a pardon from President Gerald Ford rather than face criminal charges.Trump is making a far broader argument for immunity. He contends that he cannot be prosecuted — ever — for his ""official acts"" as president unless he is first impeached, convicted by the Senate and removed from office. He was impeached twice, but the Senate failed to muster the two-thirds vote needed to convict. So, were the Supreme Court to embrace Trump's argument, it would mean, given modern political realities, that he and future presidents would likely be immune from prosecution after leaving office.Trump's definition of a protected official act is a broad one, as illustrated by an exchange between his lawyer, D. John Sauer, and Judge Florence Pan during arguments at the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., earlier this year.""Could a president order SEAL Team Six to assassinate a political rival?"" Judge Pan asked, noting that an order given by the commander in chief to the military would be an official act.Sauer replied that a former president could not be charged for giving such an order unless he had been ""impeached and convicted first.""The three-judge appeals court panel , including two Democratic and one Republican appointee, ruled unanimously against Trump on the immunity question in February. Trump then appealed to the Supreme Court, though the former president will not be there today because he is required to be at his New York trial on charges that allege he falsified New York business records in order to conceal damaging information to influence the 2016 presidential election.  <h2>A test for the high court</h2>Although there are four pending criminal indictments against Trump, only one is before the Supreme Court on Thursday: special counsel Jack Smith's case alleging that Trump knowingly and falsely sought to prevent Biden, the duly elected president, from taking office.The high court case is more than a test for presidential immunity. It is also something of a test for the Supreme Court itself, on both substance and timing. After all, even if the court were to rule against Trump, if the justices drag their feet or send the case back to the trial court for significant further findings a Trump trial would be almost certainly impossible before the November election. And if he is elected for a second time, Trump could try to dismiss the case against him — or even pardon himself if he's convicted.Trump lawyer William Scharf maintains that everything the former president is accused of doing was an official act, and that after leaving office, Trump cannot be prosecuted for those acts. ""What President Trump was trying to do was investigate election fraud in the aftermath of the 2020 election,"" Scharf says.Without presidential immunity, Scharf contends, ""You end up in a scenario where presidents will be paralyzed by the fear of post-election criminal prosecutions, and the ability of the president to discharge his duties in a vigorous and effective way will be forever crippled.""Not so, counters Peter Keisler, a who served as a top Justice Department official in the George W. Bush administration: ""You don't protect the presidency by immunizing somebody who tries to steal it.""Keisler has joined with several dozen high-ranking former GOP officeholders in filing  a Supreme Court brief opposed to Trump's position .""The text of the Constitution has no provision granting this immunity. No court decision has ever recognized this immunity. The historical understanding in our country has always been exactly the opposite,"" Keisler says. ""Fundamentally, Trump's argument's just at war with the basic precept of our system that says that no one's above the law.""NYU law professor Trevor Morrison also pushes back at Trump's claim that his actions surrounding the 2020 election were part of a president's official duties. ""The Constitution gives the president no role whatsoever in the administration of federal elections,"" says Morrison, adding that the states, Congress, even the vice president plays a role. But there is no mention in the Constitution of the president playing a role.As for Trump's claim that no president can be prosecuted unless he has been first been impeached, convicted and removed from office, Morrison calls that argument ""preposterous."" Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell clearly rejected that idea when he voted against conviction in the second Trump impeachment.""President Trump is still liable for everything he did while he was in office,"" McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor. ""We have a criminal justice system in this country ... and former presidents are not immune.""But Trump lawyer Scharf contends that if the Supreme Court doesn't put a stop to presidential liability now, ""You'll have an endless cycle of recriminations and prosecutions at the end of every presidency."" If Trump can be prosecuted after leaving office for what he did in seeking to void the election results, he says, then why not Biden for his handling of the border, Barack Obama for ordering drone strikes that resulted in American casualties, and George W. Bush for starting the Iraq War?Trump rests much of his argument on a 1982 Supreme Court decision holding that presidents have absolute immunity from  civil  lawsuits for their official acts. But the court majority in that case emphasized that it was not   deciding whether a similar immunity exists when it comes to criminal prosecutions.<h2>The Trump briefs don't include any significant discussion of the Nixon tapes case</h2>In that landmark decision, the court ordered Nixon to turn over to prosecutors specific White House tape recordings in which Nixon, then still president, plotted to cover up various campaign crimes, including the attempted bugging of the Democratic National Committee offices. When the White House tapes eventually became public, they led inexorably to a House committee vote to approve articles of impeachment and Nixon's ultimate resignation.Still, Thursday's case is not a slam dunk for the prosecutors. NYU's professor Morrison says it's ""significant"" that three members of the court — Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Elena Kagan and Brett Kavanaugh — previously served in the White House and were ""responsible for attending to questions of presidential prerogatives and presidential power.""Kavanaugh has actually been on both sides of these issues. He played an important role in the special counsel's investigation of the sex scandal involving President Bill Clinton, but more importantly, he served first as as associate counsel and then for three years as staff secretary for President George W. Bush.With that in mind, the brief filed by the group of former GOP officeholders has advanced something of a middle ground. It rejects presidential immunity for federal crimes undertaken by a president on or after Election Day in order to usurp the legitimate results of a democratic election.On ""the particular facts of the case, where the charge is that he unlawfully tried to seize the presidency after losing the election, it's sufficient to say there's certainly no presidential immunity ... for crimes like that,"" says Peter Keisler.That would leave undecided tricky immunity questions involving presidential decisions centered on foreign relations or use of the military abroad.",politics,2024-04-25 12:00:00 PM EEST,NPR,The Supreme Court is hearing Trump's claim he's immune from criminal prosecution,https://www.npr.org/2024/04/25/1246376720/donald-trump-supreme-court-immunity
