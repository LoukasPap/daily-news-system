Vanessa Romo,"The University of South Carolina wasn't the only winner of the NCAA women's basketball tournament. The television networks carrying the game were, too – with a record-setting number of viewers tuning in to watch the championship on Sunday. The final game, between South Carolina's Gamecocks and the University of Iowa's Hawkeyes, averaged about 18.7 million viewers and peaked at a whopping  24 million  combined on ESPN and ABC, making it the first time in history that a women's final has drawn a larger TV audience than the men's, according to ESPN. In contrast, the victory of the men's Division 1 UConn Huskies over Purdue averaged 14.82 million on TBS and TNT. But it's not the only sports glass ceiling that was crushed; Sunday's game was also the most-watched basketball game, either men's or women's and college or professional, since 2019.Sunday's title game was the third consecutive record-setting night for television viewership of the women's college tournament. The Elite Eight matchup between Iowa and LSU — a rematch of the 2023 NCAA championship, drew a  then-record 12.3 million viewers , ESPN said, with a peak audience of 16.1 million. The subsequent semifinals between Iowa and the University of Connecticut broke that record, attracting 14.2 million TV viewers,  ESPN said . ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro called the championship faceoff ""a fitting finale"" to the March Madness tournament. ""These exceptional athletes, coaches and teams captured our attention in unprecedented ways and it's incumbent on all of us to keep the incredible momentum going,"" Pitaro said in a statement.  A new generation of superstar athletes has fueled a new passion for women's basketball, particularly Iowa's Caitlin Clark, who became the  most prolific scorer  in NCAA history this season. Other huge draws this season include LSU's Angel Reese, the NCAA's  record-holder  for double-doubles in a season; UConn's Paige Bueckers, who will be back on the team next year for her senior season instead of entering the 2024 WNBA draft; and the  freshman phenom  from USC, JuJu Watkins.

Becky Sullivan,"World Athletics, the governing body that oversees track and field competitions worldwide, will award $50,000 in prize money to gold medal winners at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. In doing so, the organization will become the first international federation to offer prize money directly to Olympic medalists, a landmark moment in the Olympic Games' slow-but-sure shift away from amateurism. In total, the World Athletics prize pot for 2024 will amount to $2.4 million for the 48 men's and women's athletics events, which include track and field competitions like the 100-meter run, pole vault and javelin, alongside road races such as the marathon and race walk. Relay teams of four will split the winnings with $12,500 apiece. In  Wednesday's announcement , World Athletics also said it would pay prize money on a tiered basis to all medal winners in the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, with details to be announced closer to the event. ""While it is impossible to put a marketable value on winning an Olympic medal, or on the commitment and focus it takes to even represent your country at an Olympic Games, I think it is important we start somewhere and make sure some of the revenues generated by our athletes at the Olympic Games are directly returned to those who make the Games the global spectacle that it is,"" said Sebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics and a two-time Olympic gold medal runner. The prize money comes from payments to World Athletics from the International Olympic Committee, which brings in billions of dollars in revenue from broadcasting deals and other sponsorships. The IOC then redistributes millions each year to international sporting federations and national Olympic committees. The IOC was not aware of the decision until shortly before World Athletics made the public announcement, Coe said. No other sporting federations have announced similar plans to compensate medalists. <h2>Some countries give their athletes bonuses for medaling</h2>Many Olympic athletes receive medal bonuses from their home countries. The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee awards its athletes $37,500 for gold medals, $22,500 for silver and $15,000 for bronze. Some countries that field far fewer athletes offer much larger bonuses: Hong Kong offers the equivalent of about $638,000 to gold medalists, and Singapore offers about $740,000. But other countries, including the U.K. and New Zealand, offer no prize money at all.The $50,000 prizes for gold medalists underscore World Athletics' ""commitment to empowering the athletes and recognising the critical role they play in the success of any Olympic Games,"" Coe said. The costs to train and compete in the Olympics can be extremely high for athletes, who must pay thousands of dollars each year for coaching and travel to events, all while they forgo traditional career earnings in order to pursue their sport. Like many countries, the United States does not offer direct federal support for its Olympic athletes. Some athletes, especially those who compete in sports that attract the highest viewership, such as gymnastics, are able to earn money from sponsorship deals. Karsten Warholm, a Norwegian sprinter who won a gold medal in the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, welcomed the news. ""I think it's good so I want to salute them for it,"" Warholm  told Reuters . Norway is among the countries that does not offer a bonus to its medalists. ""It doesn't change my motivation to win because for the Olympics I'm not in it for the money. The gold medal is worth a lot more to me personally.""",2024-04-10 22:38:00 PM EEST,NPR,"World Athletics will pay $50,000 to Olympic gold medalists in track and field events",https://www.npr.org/2024/04/10/1243962306/olympics-gold-medal-prizes-track-and-field

None,"The National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics announced a policy Monday that all but bans transgender athletes from competing in women's sports at its 241 mostly small colleges across the country.The NAIA Council of Presidents approved the policy in a 20-0 vote at its annual convention in Kansas City, Missouri. The NAIA, which oversees some 83,000 athletes competing in more than 25 sports, is believed to be the first college sports organization to take such a step.According to the transgender participation policy, all athletes may participate in NAIA-sponsored male sports but only athletes whose biological sex assigned at birth is female and have not begun hormone therapy will be allowed participate in women's sports.A student who has begun hormone therapy may participate in activities such as workouts, practices and team activities, but not in interscholastic competition.""With the exception of competitive cheer and competitive dance, the NAIA created separate categories for male and female participants,"" the NAIA said. ""Each NAIA sport includes some combination of strength, speed and stamina, providing competitive advantages for male student-athletes. As a result, the NAIA policy for transgender student-athletes applies to all sports except for competitive cheer and competitive dance, which are open to all students.""There is no known number of transgender athletes at the high school and college levels, though it is believed to be small. The topic has nonetheless become a hot-button issue among conservative groups and others who believe transgender athletes should not be allowed to compete on girls' and women's sports teams.""The NAIA understands that legal action being taken to challenge the policy is a possibility, but this policy is one our membership and board felt like was the right decision,"" the NAIA said in a statement to The Associated Press.Shiwali Patel, senior counsel at the National Women's Law Center, said her organization was outraged by the NAIA policy.""This is unacceptable and blatant discrimination that not only harms trans, nonbinary and intersex individuals, but limits the potential of all athletes,"" Patel said in a statement. ""It's important to recognize that these discriminatory policies don't enhance fairness in competition. Instead, they send a message of exclusion and reinforce dangerous stereotypes that harm all women.""Last month, more than a dozen current and former college athletes filed a federal lawsuit against the NCAA, accusing the sports governing body for more than 500,000 athletes of violating their rights by allowing transgender women to compete in women's sports.Hours after the NAIA announcement, the NCAA released a statement: ""College sports are the premier stage for women's sports in America and the NCAA will continue to promote Title IX, make unprecedented investments in women's sports and ensure fair competition for all student-athletes in all NCAA championships.""At least 24 states have laws barring transgender women and girls from competing in certain women's or girls sports competitions.The Biden administration originally planned to release a new federal Title IX rule — the law forbids discrimination based on sex in education — addressing both campus sexual assault and transgender athletes. Earlier this year, the department decided to split them into separate rules, and the athletics rule now remains in limbo even as the sexual assault policy moves forward.Patel said the NAIA ban, along with the state laws, ""emphasizes the urgency in having clear Title IX rules that expressly prohibit this type of sex-based discrimination, and ensure the rights of all students, including transgender, nonbinary, and intersex athletes, are safeguarded. Trans athletes deserve a chance to play.""The NCAA has had a policy for transgender athlete participation in place since 2010, which called for one year of testosterone suppression treatment and documented testosterone levels submitted before championship competitions.In 2022, the NCAA revised its policies on transgender athlete participation in an attempt to align with national sport governing bodies, following the lead of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee.The three-phase implementation of the policy included a continuation of the 2010 policy, requiring transgender women to be on hormone replacement therapy for at least one year, plus the submission of a hormone-level test before the start of both the regular season and championship events.The third phase adds national and international sport governing body standards to the NCAA's policy and — after a delay — is scheduled to be implemented for the 2024-25 school year on Aug. 1.There are some 15.3 million public high school students in the United States and a 2019 study by the CDC estimated 1.8% of them — about 275,000 — are transgender. The number of athletes within that group is much smaller; a 2017 survey by Human Rights Campaign suggested fewer than 15% of all transgender boys and transgender girls play sports.The number of NAIA transgender athletes would be far smaller.",2024-04-09 01:04:00 AM EEST,NPR,NAIA all but bans transgender athletes from women's sports,https://www.npr.org/2024/04/08/1243548261/naia-transgender-athlete-sports-ban
Emma Bowman,"The South Carolina Gamecocks were crowned national women's champions on Sunday, beating fellow top-seed rival Iowa Hawkeyes and  star Caitlin Clark  87-75.The win gives coach Dawn Staley and her team a third NCAA title, capping a perfect season for the Gamecocks.The Hawkeyes had a strong start shooting spree buoyed by Clark. The Iowa guard sank a last-minute 3-pointer to notch 18 points in the first quarter –  the most ever scored  in a single quarter of a tournament game in NCAA history. In the end, even with the league's top player, Iowa was no match for South Carolina's teamwork.Four players netted double-digits, led by freshman Tessa Johnson at 19 points. Senior Kamilla Cardoso, who earned MVP honors, powered through a recent knee injury to put up 15 points and 17 rebounds. Defensive work from Bree Hall and Raven Johnson — whose steal from Clark broke open the Gamecocks' lead at halftime — slowed Clark's stride.It was redemption for Staley after losing to Iowa in last year's semifinal. Staley, who had to rebuild a young team after losing five players from the starting lineup last year, was emotional after the buzzer.""It doesn't always end like you want it to end — much like last year — but my freshies are at the top of my heart because they wanted this,"" Staley said in a post-game interview with ESPN.Freshman Johnson credited the team's success with the environment Staley helped create: ""We're unselfish people and that's how we win it,"" she said after the game. After the game, Staley praised Clark's historic run in remarks to the stadium crowd.""I want to personally thank Caitlin Clark for lifting up our sport,"" she said. ""She carried a heavy load. You are one of the GOATs of our game and we appreciate you.""It was Clark's last chance at a championship ring during her college career. She plans to  enter the WNBA draft next year . But she's got other wins at top of mind.""People will probably remember our two Final Fours and things like that,"" she told reporters.

"Russell Lewis,Becky Sullivan,Emma Bowman","The football great Orenthal James Simpson, known as O.J., who was accused and ultimately acquitted in the killings of his ex-wife and her friend, has died.   Simpson was 76.In  a post on X , his family said he died on Wednesday. He ""succumbed to his battle with cancer,"" and was surrounded by his children and grandchildren. Simpson was a cultural icon who starred on the football field and in movies and commercials.   That legacy was forever eclipsed after he made headlines in 1994 for another reason when he was accused of killing his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman. In 1995, jurors determined he was not guilty in the stabbing deaths. No one else was ever charged. Dubbed the ""trial of the century,"" the nationally televised proceedings captivated the country with a verdict that reverberated across the U.S. with debates about police misconduct, race, celebrity and domestic abuse.O.J. Simpson first found fame on the football field. Once a kid who wore leg braces until age 5 after developing rickets, Simpson went on to become one of the greatest running backs of all time.   He played at the University of Southern California (USC) in the late 1960s. The powerful tailback danced, dashed and dazzled on the field, propelling the Trojans to a national championship in 1967. He won the Heisman trophy, as college football's best player, in 1968.After graduating from USC, he played 11 seasons in the NFL; nine of them with the Buffalo Bills, and two seasons with the San Francisco 49ers. Known as ""The Juice,"" he collected four rushing titles, played in five Pro Bowls and, in 1973, became the first running back to break the 2,000-yard rushing mark. During and after his pro career ended in 1979, he starred in TV commercials, mostly notably as a pitchman for Hertz as he rushed through airports for the rental car company. He also later appeared in several shows and movies,   including  The Naked Gun  and the TV miniseries  Roots ,   as producers seized on his fame and likeability.In 1994, the bodies of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman, were found stabbed outside her home in Los Angeles. Not long after, Simpson was arrested and his subsequent ""low-speed"" white Bronco car chase on L.A. freeways was televised nationwide; some  95 million people  tuned into the chase coverage. In 1995, a criminal jury determined he was not guilty of committing the killings. The most famous moment of the months-long trial was when a prosecutor asked OJ to try on the gloves believed to belong to the killer. In a dramatic showing, Simpson struggled to pull on the snug pair. Defense lawyer Johnnie Cochrane seized on this, delivering the most famous line of the whole spectacle in his closing arguments: ""If it doesn't fit, you must acquit.""Prosecutors Marcia Clark, William Hodgman and Christopher Darden came to the trial with strong evidence linking Simpson to the killings, including DNA tests, the right hand of a pair of blood-stained gloves that were found at his home, and his history of spousal abuse.Simpson's legal team of prominent criminal defense lawyers, including Johnnie Cochran and Alan Dershowitz, F. Lee Bailey and Robert Kardashian, successfully made the case to the jury that there was reasonable doubt. It cast the LAPD as racist and corrupt, arguing that it had tampered with forensic evidence at a shoddy crime scene.When the mixed-race jury announced the not guilty verdict, public reaction seen in media coverage largely fell along racial lines, showing Black people celebrating and white people shocked by his acquittal. Those TV clips didn't tell the full story, says Camille Charles, a professor of Africana Studies at the University of Pennsylvania. It wasn't that Black Americans all thought he was innocent, she says.""Black people were more conflicted than was really ever shown in the media,"" Charles says. But, she says, ""Black folks had had such a bad experience with the criminal justice system that they rooted for him as a Black man who actually had the resources to mount a proper defense.""The trial took place three years after the  acquittal of four LAPD officers  in the beating of Rodney King had inflamed the deep distrust among Black people and police.But, as a wealthy celebrity who married a white woman, Simpson was ""never seen as a staunch proponent of the African American community,"" says Darnell Hunt, a professor of sociology and African American studies at UCLA, and as a result, didn't engender overwhelming sympathy among African Americans during his trial.Two years later, a different civil jury determined he was liable in the deaths and ordered him to pay $33 million to the families of Brown and Goldman. Simpson continued to maintain his innocence in media interviews.That wasn't his last tangle with legal trouble. In 2007, he led a group of men to a Las Vegas hotel room to confront some sports memorabilia dealers. Several people brought guns with them, and Simpson was later convicted of armed robbery. He served almost a decade in a Nevada prison and was  released on parole in 2017 .The public's fascination with O.J. Simpson never waned. He was the subject of numerous documentaries about the killings and his life.",2024-04-12 01:26:00 AM EEST,NPR,"O.J.

He was the first foreign-born wrestler to reach the level of  yokozuna  — or grand champion — in Japan.""It is with sadness that we announce Akebono Taro died of heart failure earlier this month while receiving care at a hospital in the Tokyo area,"" the family said in a statement.His wife Christine Rowan, in an email to The Associated Press, said he died ""within the past week"" but declined to give details.""I had to tend to personal matters that needed to be done prior to publicly announcing my husband's death,"" she said.Akebono grew up on the rural side of the Koolau mountains from Honolulu and was born Chad George Ha'aheo Rowan.He moved to Tokyo in the late 1980s and won his first grand championship in 1993.At the prime of his career he was a real giant, reported at the time to weigh 500 pounds (225 kilos) and stand 6-feet-8 — or 2.03 meters.The United States ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel,  sent his condolences on social platform X .""I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Akebono, a giant in the world of sumo, a proud Hawaiian and a bridge between the United States and Japan,"" Emanuel posted.""When Akebono became the first-ever foreign-born grand champion, sumo's highest rank, in 1993, he opened the door for other foreign wrestlers to find success in the sport.

Ximena Bustillo,"GILBERT, Ariz. — It was Annie Lewis' idea to put a ""Republicans for Biden"" sign in the front yard in the lead-up to 2020. For her, it came down to civility. As a teacher for over a decade, the mother of six little ones, and a lifelong member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, she felt then-President Trump did not show true leadership.""I was embarrassed anytime a clip of Trump, at that time, was on and my children were in the room,"" Lewis said.Lewis was not alone in her thinking. In 2020,  GOP residents of Maricopa County in Arizona banded  together  to stand up against Trump . The signs were created by Dan Barker, a leader in the Maricopa County LDS community and former GOP-appointed judge, who wanted to find a way to support Biden without giving up his lifelong Republican identity. His wife, Nan, was the one who pushed him to have a sign. ""She probably got there quicker than I did,"" said Barker, who in 2020 started the political action committee Arizona Republicans Who Believe in Treating Others with Respect. ""I just wasn't quite comfortable identifying with the Democratic Party. And so for me, I said, hey, well, I'd rather do something like, 'Republicans for Biden.' ""Barker doled out thousands of signs, picketing at busy street corners and standing them up on lawns. Sometimes they were torn down, and other times they created controversy on community Facebook pages. But Biden ultimately won the state by just over 10,000 votes and flipped Maricopa County, the county with the largest share of Arizona's voters. Barker credits the win, in part, to his campaign.""That's one of the main reasons we did it — so that people would know that you could be a conservative and vote for Biden because you did not find Trump acceptable,"" Barker said. ""And Biden was somebody that you can vote for, you don't have to agree with every position he takes.""With Trump back in the GOP's top seat, Barker hopes to reignite his PAC's efforts. Members of the LDS church make up just over  5% of the population in Arizona . But in this state, margins matter — making it prime for all kinds of voting blocs to flex their power. The Trump campaign nationally  struggled to court reliably Republican LDS voters in 2016 , and  again in 2020 , and  recently views on Trump have not improved . In a state where tight margins and voter enthusiasm could determine the White House, several self-identifying Republican LDS women say the party has left them behind.<h2>How LDS Republicans began to question their party loyalty</h2>Günes Murat Tezcür, director of the School of Politics and Global Studies at Arizona State University, said LDS members are typically reliable Republican voters. But changes in the GOP over the last eight years under Trump's leadership have led to hesitation. ""There's something to be said about the more urban, educated Mormons who became more questioning,"" Tezcür said, describing the demographic in Maricopa County. ""That makes Arizona more interesting because this population may have some real implications for the outcome of the election every November, especially in the presidential contest.""Stan Barnes, a political consultant in Phoenix, agrees that Republican voters — particularly women — turning away from their party's candidates has helped Democrats win the presidency and the governor's office. ""There are people all over Arizona that are otherwise Republican voters that don't know what to do because they cannot get over Donald Trump's jackassery,"" Barnes said. ""They don't know how to bring themselves to vote for someone that they judge to be so flawed as a human being.""The Trump campaign and Arizona GOP did not respond to a request for comment on how they are courting LDS voters and responding to criticism. But the sense that voters might be up for grabs is not lost on the other side. Jon Ryder, executive director of the Maricopa County Democrats, said he is looking forward to courting these questioning voters.""We have the Democrats we want to turn out, we have the independents who we have to make sure are voting our way and turn out,"" Ryder said. ""And then we have the persuasion universe of independents and Republicans, especially Republican women, who when they hear our message or when they hear the message from our candidates, are more likely to support our candidates than the other side. And so we do have a plan for that.""<h2>Political involvement is almost a given</h2>Tezcür said that certain elements of the LDS faith, such as serving missions and its  history as a violently persecuted religious minority , might make some members more open to progressive views on immigration and diversity, while still having conservative stances on economic policy, government regulation and other social issues.On a sunny day in Gilbert, six women, including Lewis, gathered in a large living room in Andersen's home to discuss their experiences in religion and politics. They tout their community involvement in particular.""We're very involved citizens. So you're going to get active people [who do and don't support Trump],"" said Jane Andersen, a member of Mormon Women for Ethical Government, a nonprofit group that promotes civic engagement among the LDS community. ""But I think there is a vested interest, especially for women, in becoming active in this sphere.""Running for city council, state legislature, working at polling sites and with nonprofits, they all emphasized how their work and faith influence how they want to inspire their own children.""I get to go out and experience things in the schools, and I get to go out and see things in the community,"" said Rachel Albertsen, who lives in Gilbert and voted for then-presidential candidate Nikki Haley in March. ""My husband goes to an office and he comes home. That's a unique experience that I get to go and my kids see me doing things like that.""<h2>This tight community feels a sense of 'political homelessness'</h2>All the women who gathered to speak to NPR are members of the LDS church, and all, at least at one point, were registered Republicans. Julie Spilsbury, a council member in Mesa, says she's always been a registered Republican, ""Mostly because that's how I was raised."" Spilsbury also voted for Haley in March's election. Despite Arizona holding a closed primary where independents could not participate, Haley — who generally attracted independent voters — received nearly 20% of the vote. ""The term 'politically homeless' resonates with me,"" Spilsbury said. ""If you're a Republican, but you're not a MAGA Republican or a Trump Republican, where do you fit?""Maricopa County has the  third-highest number of church congregations, or ""stakes,"" and temples . What makes the LDS community unique, Spilsbury said, is that, unlike other religions, members do not get to pick which congregation they attend. It  is split up geographically , like school districts. It's done for practical and spiritual reasons to promote tolerance of differences, including political differences. But that doesn't always go as intended.""I have about five or six families in our ward that will not speak to my husband and I over political differences. And these are people whom we have served with throughout the years and have incredible sacred experiences together,"" Spilsbury said. ""And because we have political differences now, we can't be friends. And that's painful.""Suzanne Lunt of Gilbert, who also voted for Haley, left the Republican Party after the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, and only switched back to vote against Trump in March.""I remained a Republican until Jan. 6. And then I watched to see how the Republican Party would respond to the events that occurred,"" Lunt said. ""And I wasn't pleased with that. And so I became an independent.""She noted the issue of abortion is often what keeps people loyal to the party, especially in the church. But a recent church address allowed her to feel like she didn't have to toe the party line.""One of our leaders said, 'You may not be able to focus just on that one issue, that we've got to think about the whole person and the morality and the goodness and that you have to choose what's most important to you,' "" Lunt said. ""And it kind of gave me permission.""Division within Arizona Republicans has been exacerbated by candidates' political rhetoric up and down the ballot, said Andersen, recalling when then-gubernatorial candidate (now-Senate candidate)  Kari Lake told Republicans affiliating with the late Sen. John McCain to ""get out.""  Lake  has since walked back the statement .""Because I have some issues with authority, I have decided I will stay firmly planted,"" Andersen said. ""I will still be a registered Republican, in part because you can't tell me I don't belong. And guess what? You don't grow a party by kicking people out.""Andersen said she has never supported Trump. The last straw for her was when Trump imitated a  journalist with disabilities during a political rally in 2016  — she thought of her son, who has a disability. ""Not only did that not resonate with me, it angered me. Because my son has value. It doesn't matter if he's different,"" Andersen said. ""Our country can weather some bad tax policy, but if we are led by people devoid of character, that's going to produce generational harm.""All the women said they think about how their faith, involvement and vote will impact the next generation. Albertsen, a mother of four, reflected on how one of her daughters perceived her role in the community.""She sees an example of a mother who is active in civics and is active in the community and is active in her faith community,"" Albertsen said. ""And I think that's something within our faith community. ... We all have multiple children that we're influencing.""<h2>Where the opportunities lie</h2>Although a faction of the GOP base is feeling uneasy about their candidates, many are still likely to support the party picks — especially when faced with a Biden record they may not fully align with. ""Let's face it, Donald Trump is a flawed human being and a flawed candidate, but he's not running against a perfect human being and a perfect candidate,"" said Barnes, the Phoenix-based consultant. ""Now it is about Trump, the flawed candidate, versus the Biden record, which is as sour as it can be in Arizona.""Reita Juarez is one Maricopa County LDS voter who has voted for Trump and plans to do so again. Still, he wasn't her top pick. Originally a registered independent, she switched to Republican in the presidential preference and voted for businessman Vivek Ramaswamy. Ahead of the general, she considered voting for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., before settling on Trump again.""I don't have a ton of trust for our government anymore. And that goes for both Republicans and Democrats,"" Juarez said. ""I'm not happy with the Republican Party as a whole.""Although she agrees Trump's behavior is not something she likes either, she still finds herself aligning with his conservative stances on immigration and abortion. At times, she said, she also feels ostracized for her political choices within the LDS community.""We all have to end up justifying something somewhere. If I justify Trump's big, big, fat mouth or his awful rhetoric, it's because we're limited with these choices,"" Juarez said. ""We have to balance and weigh these things.""Cheeri Farnsworth, another lifelong Republican voter, is also planning to be loyal to Trump and has hosted private meet-and-greets for Republican Senate candidate Lake.""[Trump] aligns with my family values and with my religion and what I feel like this country needs right now,"" Farnsworth said, noting border security is one of her top issues. ""We all get to choose what we want. Who we want to vote for, what our beliefs are — we have that freedom. We have good friends I can think of off the top of my head that are voting for Biden.""Still, the women who are planning to support the current president warn that Biden needs to reach out more. They said they haven't seen much movement, but there is plenty of opportunity — especially with younger LDS members.At the end of the day, Spilsbury finds political power on all sides in what she calls the ""Maricopa County, East Valley Mormon moms.""""Moms make the world go round and nothing gets done without us.

None,"<h2>1. For much of his career, O.J. Simpson symbolized a post-racial America.</h2>Orenthal James Simpson, known as O.J., died on Wednesday aged 76 after battling cancer.Simpson was a football icon, an NFL hall of famer and a trailblazer. He starred in commercials, like this  1978 Hertz ad . The Hertz campaign, which ran for years, was one of the first times an American audience saw a Black spokesperson for a major national company. Simpson later went on to become a movie star.Since his early days in the NFL, when asked about his feelings on issues like the civil rights movement, he'd say: "" I'm not Black. I'm O.J.! ""Dave Zirin, the sports editor at  The Nation , told NPR that  Simpson linked this post-racial idea to economic success : ""It was linked in his mind to actually being unshackled by racism. And it was linked in his mind to being a celebrity first and any sort of spokesperson for a cause second.""<h2>2. Simpson became a symbol of America's complicated relationship to race, celebrity and justice.</h2>In 1994, he was accused of killing his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman. The case and ensuing trial captivated the country. It came just two years after the acquittal of four Los Angeles Police officers. The officers had been charged with excessive force in the beating and arrest of Rodney King, a Black man. That acquittal led to six days of riots throughout Los Angeles.Zirin says the Simpson trial was a giant Rorschach test , in that what you thought about the trial spoke to what you believed about racism, police corruption, gender, domestic abuse and a two-tiered justice system that favors the wealthy and famous.""People had strong opinions and opposing opinions about all of these topics. So O.J., who always saw himself as this kind of figure of unity in the United States, all of a sudden became this figure of profound polarization, where what you said about O.J. and the case actually indicated what you believed about a whole host of other incendiary topics.""<h2>3. Three decades later what's the legacy of the OJ Simpson trial?</h2>Simpson's acquittal divided the country.Zirin says the verdict became like an early form of a social media algorithm, with people turning on each other instantaneously based upon what they felt the case said about the United States. ""It was strongly divided among racial lines, because in the Black community, when they looked at the trial, what they saw first and foremost was Los Angeles with its own history of police corruption ... they saw police officers who engaged in actions or past commentaries that were racist,"" he said.""And it made people say, well, wait a minute, maybe this isn't just about O.J. maybe this is about a broader corruption among police and a broader racism in U.S. society. While a whole other side was saying, well, wait a minute, what about Nicole Brown Simpson? What about Ronald Goldman? Where is the justice for them?""To Zirin, the legacy of this trial is division and recognition.""If we didn't have [recognition] before, we certainly had it after the trial — that different people see this country in profoundly different ways.

None,"Indira Navas    of Miami found out that her 6-year-old son, Andres, had been disenrolled from Florida's Medicaid program when she took him to a doctor appointment in March. She had scheduled Andres' appointment months in advance and is frustrated that he remains uninsured.Meanwhile, Navas said the state could not explain why her daughter, Camila, 12, remained covered by Medicaid even though the children live in the same household with their parents.""It doesn't make sense that they would cover one of my children and not the other,"" Navas says.The Navas  family are among millions of Americans caught in the bumpy Medicaid unwinding, playing out across the country over the past year.<h2>A close look at the numbers</h2>Nearly a quarter of adults disenrolled from Medicaid say they are now uninsured, according to  a survey released April 12     that details how tens of millions of Americans struggled to retain coverage in the government insurance program for low-income people after pandemic-era protections began expiring last spring.The first national survey of adults whose Medicaid eligibility was reviewed during the unwinding found nearly half of people who lost their government coverage signed back up weeks or months later — suggesting they should never have been dropped in the first place.While 23% reported being uninsured, an additional 28% found other coverage — through an employer, Medicare, the Affordable Care Act's insurance marketplace, or health care for members of the military, the survey by the health research organization KFF found.""Twenty-three percent is a striking number especially when you think about the number of people who lost Medicaid coverage,"" says  Chima Ndumele ,     an associate professor of health policy at the Yale University School of Public Health.<h2>Temporary gaps for some</h2>Going without insurance even for a short period of time can lead people to delay seeking care and leave them at financial risk when they do.Seven in 10 adults who were disenrolled during the unwinding process say they became uninsured at least temporarily when they lost their Medicaid coverage.Adrienne Hamar, 49, of Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania, says she struggled to enroll in an Affordable Care Act marketplace plan this winter after the state informed her that she and her two children no longer qualified for Medicaid. They had been enrolled since 2020. She says phone lines were busy at the state's marketplace and she couldn't complete the process online.Hamar, who works as a home health aide, and her children were uninsured in March. But since April 1, they've been enrolled in a marketplace plan that, with the help of government subsidies, costs $50 a month for the family.""I was very relieved,"" she says. Unsure of their insurance status, Hamar said, her 23-year-old daughter delayed getting a dental checkup.Hamar's struggles were common, the survey found.Of adults enrolled in Medicaid before the unwinding, about 35% who tried to renew their coverage described the process as difficult, and about 48% said it was at least somewhat stressful.About 56% of those disenrolled say they skipped or delayed care or prescriptions while attempting to renew their Medicaid coverage.""People's current insurance status is likely to be very much in flux, and we would expect at least some of the people who say they are currently uninsured to reenroll in Medicaid — many say they are still trying — or enroll in other coverage within a short period of time,"" says Jennifer Tolbert, a co-author of the KFF report and the director of KFF's State Health Reform and Data Program.The survey didn't include children, and the KFF researchers said their findings therefore couldn't be extrapolated to determine how the Medicaid unwinding has affected the overall U.S. uninsured rate, which hit a record low of  7.7% in early 2023 . Nearly half of enrollees in Medicaid and the related Children's Health Insurance Program are children.Enrollment in Medicaid and CHIP grew to a record of nearly 94.5 million in April of last year, three years after the federal government prohibited states from cutting people from their rolls during the covid-19 public health emergency. The unwinding won't be completed until later this year. States are reassessing eligibility for Medicaid among millions of Americans who enrolled before or during the pandemic and dropping those who no longer qualify or did not complete the renewal process.      Nationally, states have disenrolled about 20 million people from Medicaid in the past year, most of them for procedural reasons such as failure to submit required paperwork. That number is expected to grow, as states have a few more months to redetermine enrollees' eligibility.Among adults who had Medicaid prior to the start of the unwinding, 83% retained their coverage or reenrolled, while 8% found other insurance and 8% were uninsured. The share left uninsured was larger in states that have not expanded Medicaid under the ACA (17%) than in states that have (6%). Forty states have expanded Medicaid to cover everyone with an income under 138% of the federal poverty rate, or $31,200 for a family of four this year.<h2>Discovered when needed</h2>The KFF survey found that nearly 1 in 3 disenrolled adults discovered only when they sought health care — such as going to a doctor or a pharmacy — that they had been dropped from Medicaid.Kate McEvoy, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, says the sheer volume of millions of people being redetermined for eligibility has overwhelmed some state call centers trying to support enrollees.She says states have tried many ways to communicate with enrollees, including through public outreach campaigns, text, email, and apps. ""Until the moment your coverage is at stake, it's hard to penetrate people's busy lives,"" she says.The KFF survey, of 1,227 adults who had Medicaid coverage in early 2023 prior to the start of the unwinding on April 1, 2023, was conducted between Feb. 15, 2024, and March 11, 2024. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.KFF Health News correspondent Daniel Chang contributed to this article.KFF Health News  is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at  KFF .",2024-04-18 19:22:00 PM EEST,NPR,Florida kicked their son off Medicaid in the 'unwinding' but not their daughter,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/04/18/1244919733/medicaid-health-insurance-florida-pennsylvania-aca
Luke Garrett,"Trader Joe's has recalled fresh basil sold in 29 states and Washington, D.C., after a federal investigation linked the product to a dozen cases of salmonella infection in seven states. So far, one patient among the 12 affected has been hospitalized,  according to the Food and Drug Administration . The grocery chain has removed the product from its shelves, but Trader Joe's  warned  customers to check their kitchens for the Infinite Herbs-brand organic basil sold between Feb. 1 and April 6 — and throw it out. Customers can also return the recalled basil for a full refund, the company said.The product was packaged in 2.5-oz clamshell containers and sold in the District of Columbia along with the following states: Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia and Wisconsin.The 12 salmonella cases tied to the recalled basil are in Florida, Georgia, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Wisconsin, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The FDA traced these cases back to the Infinite Herbs-branded organic basil after seven of the eight patients with ""information available"" told federal investigators they had been exposed to Trader Joe's basil before getting sick. The supplier, Infinite Herbs LLC, is based in Miami. The supplier is cooperating with investigators, the FDA said. If a customer removed their Trader Joe's basil from its packaging to freeze it and they aren't sure if it's been recalled, the CDC recommended they play it safe. Don't eat it, throw it out, and then clean all the surfaces it touched. Salmonella illness and symptoms can occur 12 to 72 hours after eating contaminated food. The infection can cause diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps. It can also inflict severe infections in children under five, the elderly, and people with weak immune systems. If you have symptoms, contact your doctor, the FDA said.  The federal investigation into the salmonella outbreak is ongoing, according to the FDA. It's still looking for additional cases and sources of salmonella. The latest salmonella infection within this investigation started on April 2.

None,"<h2>1. Trump wasn't always anti-abortion.</h2>Trump will forever be known as the president who appointed the justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade in June of 2022.   But the former president hasn't always been against abortion rights .  In 1999, when he was considering a run for the White House, Trump told NBC's Tim Russert on Meet the Press:""I'm very pro-choice. I hate the concept of abortion. I hate it, I hate everything it stands for. I cringe when people debate the subject. But I still believe in choice.""By 2011, Trump had changed his position . Once again he was considering a run for president, and Trump described himself as ""pro-life"" when speaking to the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC.<h2>2. When he first ran for president, about half the country supported a legal right to abortion.</h2> But a key group of voters overwhelmingly opposed it – white evangelical Christians. Trump needed their support, and he was successful: exit polling in the 2016 election showed  nearly two-thirds of Christian voters chose Trump . Their candidate delivered. Trump appointed  three Supreme Court justices during his term – which ultimately led to the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Some Republicans in Congress are pushing for a federal ban on abortion , with many in the Republican base pressuring Trump to voice his support. Last week, Trump posted a video on Truth Social that supported leaving abortion access up to the states:"" My view is that now that we have abortion where everybody wanted it from a legal standpoint.  The states will determine by vote or legislation  or perhaps both, and whatever they decide must be the law of the land, in this case the law of the state.""By saying he will instead leave the issue to the states - essentially the status quo - Trump appears to be trying to avoid strengthening Democrats' ability to rally their voters around abortion rights.<h2>3.  Now, an anti-abortion stance could be a political liability.</h2> Every time there's been an abortion referendum since Dobbs,  voters have favored abortion rights .   Supporting a national abortion ban is a position that some Republicans like Chris Christie and Nikki Haley have said was unwise or at least impractical. This election year,  Trump's position on abortion could influence whether he wins or loses the race.  But if he  is  elected, anti-abortion activists will likely push Trump to use the power of the executive branch to restrict abortion access.

Rachel Treisman,"Beware, Botox users: Public health authorities are warning that counterfeit versions of the injectable are circulating — and have already made patients sick — in several U.S. states.Nineteen people reported harmful reactions to botulinum toxin injections as of last Friday, including nine who were hospitalized, the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  said in a release. They are located in nine states: Colorado, Florida,  Illinois , Kentucky, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York,  Tennessee  and Washington. All of the affected patients identify as female, and range in age from 25 to 59. All but one reported receiving the injections for cosmetic purposes. And they were all treated either by untrained individuals, or in non-health care settings like homes and spas. ""These incidents have occurred when counterfeit Botox is injected by licensed and unlicensed individuals and/or in non-medical or unlicensed settings,"" the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  said in a warning  to health care professionals and consumers.Symptoms included blurred or double vision, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth, constipation, incontinence, shortness of breath, weakness and difficulty lifting one's head after injection — which the FDA says are similar to those seen when botulism,  a rare and potentially fatal illness , attacks the body's nervous system. Four people nationwide were treated for botulism out of concerns that the toxin had spread beyond the injection site, the CDC said. Five people were tested for the illness, all with negative results. The CDC, FDA and several state and local health departments are working to identify the sources of the counterfeits. The FDA said they appear to have been purchased from unlicensed sources, meaning they may be ""misbranded, adulterated, counterfeit, contaminated, improperly stored and transported, ineffective and/or unsafe."" The FDA says there is currently no indication that these incidents were linked to the brand-name Botox manufactured by the pharmaceutical company AbbVie (which is one of several  FDA-approved brands  of the neurotoxin, including Dysport, Xeomin, Jeuveau and Daxxify). ""The genuine product should be considered safe and effective for its intended and approved uses,"" the FDA added. But public health officials are warning anyone who is considering Botox to make sure they're getting the real thing — which, experts tell NPR, starts with finding a trustworthy provider.  Dr. Seemal Desai, the president of the American Academy of Dermatology, told NPR over Zoom that the rise in counterfeit injectables underscores the urgent need for patients to understand who they're choosing to perform Botox, like any other medical procedure. ""There are 19 patients too many who have had an adverse event,"" he said. ""I hope what comes out of this is the opportunity to educate the public on being your own advocate, to kind of help yourself avoid these issues by making the simple call to the right person."" <h2>Pick a provider with the right qualifications</h2>Botox injections should only be performed in a medical office by a board-certified dermatologist, or other appropriately trained clinician under the supervision of one, Desai says. He says that's because they have the requisite years of training to avoid certain risks — like knowing, for example, where the forehead artery is located — and treat potential complications if they arise. And, in compliance with FDA guidelines, they purchase the product from the manufacturer itself, significantly reducing the risk of counterfeits. ""Don't just pick your person off a TikTok video or from a Groupon or from something that you just searched on Google once and someone's the top search,"" Desai adds. ""Do a little bit more research."" But that doesn't mean it has to take long: He recommends using the American Academy of Dermatology's  online search tool  to find a board-certified dermatologist within your zip code. There are other ways to vet your provider, whether or not they're a dermatologist. Anyone who is injecting a patient has to be licensed in the state where they perform the procedure, says Dr. Gregory Greco, the past president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. And he says patients in most states can and should do a little searching — whether through the health department, consumer affairs department or licensing boards — to find that license. Plus, he says, most drug manufacturers that sell to licensed health care providers will have those names listed on their website, so patients can cross-reference there too. Reputable providers put patient safety first, from the way they sterilize equipment to administer the injection to avoid cross-contamination, Greco told NPR.""When things are being put into your body, you have a responsibility to yourself and your own safety to make sure that you're going to a qualified individual,"" he added. <h2>Pay attention to the product</h2>Greco says patients can also ask their doctors to show them their cabinets and refrigerators where the product is kept. That could be especially useful in the case of fake Botox, which the FDA says also include counterfeiting of the outer carton and vial. It says one or more of the following will signal a knockoff (and asks consumers to  report suspected counterfeits ): Even though the investigation is still underway, Greco believes the counterfeit products are the result of unlicensed providers trying to cut down on costs by getting them through unreliable third parties — and hurting their unknowing clientele. The exact cost of the procedure is somewhat variable, though Greco says patients should be suspicious of any provider whose price generally seems too good to be true. ""I think the public has to be aware that in no way, shape or form should economics compromise patient safety,"" Greco adds. He hopes the investigation will not only identify the source and contents of the counterfeits, but also discipline the bad actors who are cutting corners — and warn others who might otherwise follow suit. ""Patients are hurt because [someone] took a shortcut to get a product that was not authentic product, and that's not fair to the patients,"" he said. ""The patients were unaware."" <h2>Recognize common —  and unusual — side effects</h2>Even bona fide Botox carries the risk of certain side effects, though Greco stresses it has a well-established safety profile. Standard side effects include redness, swelling, tenderness or bruising at the injection site, and occasionally a droopy eyelid. He says other reactions, like difficulty swallowing or speaking, have been reported but are extremely rare.When it comes to the counterfeits, Greco says the reported side effects are much more serious. In particular, affected patients' inability to lift their heads afterward suggests to him that they were injected with a highly concentrated form of Botox that spread through the bloodstream, causing systemic symptoms. Greco suspects that the reaction occurred within 24 to 48 hours after the injection, though he says patients who got Botox longer ago than that can always call their doctor if they're concerned. The FDA says anyone experiencing those specific symptoms should contact a health care professional or go to the emergency room, and  report the incident online .Experts recommend taking all of these precautions ahead of your next appointment, even if it's already scheduled — and postponing it if you have any concerns.""If in doubt, don't get the injection,"" the CDC says.",2024-04-19 12:01:00 PM EEST,NPR,Fake Botox has sickened patients nationwide.

None,"When one Chinese national recently petitioned the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to become a permanent resident, he thought his chances were pretty good. As an accomplished biologist, he figured that news articles in top media outlets, including  The New York Times , covering his research would demonstrate his ""extraordinary ability"" in the sciences, as called for by  the EB-1A visa .But when the immigration officers rejected his petition, they noted that his name did not appear anywhere in the news articles. News coverage of a paper he co-authored did not directly demonstrate his major contribution to the work.As this biologist's close friend, I felt bad for him because I knew how much he had dedicated to the project. He even started the idea as one of his Ph.D. dissertation chapters. But as a scientist who  studies topics related to scientific innovation , I understand the immigration officers' perspective:  Research is increasingly done through teamwork , so it's hard to know individual contributions if a news article reports only the study findings.This anecdote made me and my colleagues  Misha Teplitskiy  and  David Jurgens  curious about what affects journalists' decisions about which researchers to feature in their news stories.There's a lot at stake for a scientist whose name is or isn't mentioned in journalistic coverage of their work. News media play a key role in  disseminating new scientific findings to the public . The coverage of a particular study brings prestige to its research team and their institutions. The depth and quality of coverage then shapes public perception of  who is doing good science . In some cases, as my friend's story suggests, the coverage can affect individual careers.Do scientists' social identities, such as ethnicity or race, play a role in who gets named?This question is not straightforward to answer. On the one hand, racial bias may exist, given the profound  underrepresentation of minorities in U.S. mainstream media . On the other, science journalism is known for its  high standard of objective reporting .  We decided to investigate this question  in a systematic fashion using large-scale observational data.<h2>The least coverage? Chinese and African names</h2>My colleagues and I analyzed 223,587 news stories from 288 U.S. media outlets, sourced from Altmetric.com, a website that  monitors online posts about research papers . The news stories, published from 2011-2019, covered 100,486 scientific papers. For each paper, we focused on authors with the highest chance of being mentioned: the first author, last author and other designated corresponding authors. We calculated how often the authors were mentioned in the news articles reporting their research.We used an  algorithm  to infer  perceived ethnicity from authors' names . We figured that journalists may rely on such cues in the absence of scientists' self-reported information. We considered authors with Anglo names – like John Brown or Emily Taylor – as the majority group and then compared the average mention rates across nine broad ethnic groups.Our methodology does not distinguish Black from white names because many African Americans have Anglo names, such as Michael Jackson. But since we focus on perceived identity across nine different groups based on names, the study's design is still meaningful.We found that for the subset of first, last and corresponding authors on research papers, the overall chance of being credited by name in a news story was 40%. Authors with minority ethnicity names, however, were significantly less likely to be mentioned compared with authors with Anglo names. The disparity was most pronounced for authors with East Asian and African names; they were on average mentioned or quoted about 15% less in U.S. science media relative to those with Anglo names.This association is consistent even after accounting for factors such as geographical location, corresponding author status, authorship position, affiliation rank, author prestige, research topics, journal impact and story length.And the disparity held across different types of outlets, including publishers of press releases, general interest news and those with content focused on science and technology.<h2>Pragmatic factors and language choices</h2>Our results don't directly imply media bias. So what's going on?First and foremost, the underrepresentation of scientists with East Asian and African names may be due to pragmatic challenges faced by U.S.-based journalists in interviewing them. Factors like time zone differences for researchers based overseas and  actual or perceived English fluency  could be at play as a journalist works under deadline to produce the story.We isolated these factors by focusing on researchers affiliated with American institutions. Among U.S.-based researchers, pragmatic difficulties should be minimized because they're in the same geographic region as the journalists and they're likely to be proficient in English, at least in writing. In addition, these scientists would presumably be equally likely to respond to journalists' interview requests, given that media attention is  increasingly valued by U.S. institutions .Even when we looked just at U.S. institutions, we found significant disparities in mentions and quotations for non-Anglo-named authors, albeit slightly reduced. In particular, East Asian- and African-named authors experience a 4 to 5 percentage-point drop in mention rates compared with their Anglo-named counterparts. This result suggests that while pragmatic considerations can explain some disparities, they don't account for all of them.We found that journalists were also more likely to substitute institutional affiliations for scientists with African and East Asian names – for instance, writing about ""researchers from the University of Michigan."" This institution-substitution effect underscores a potential bias in media representation, where scholars with minority ethnicity names may be perceived as less authoritative or deserving of formal recognition.<h2>Why equity matters in the discourse on science</h2>Part of the depth of science news coverage depends on how thoroughly and accurately researchers are portrayed in stories, including whether scientists are mentioned by name and the extent to which their contributions are highlighted via quotes. As science becomes increasingly globalized, with English as its primary language, our study highlights the importance of equitable representation in shaping public discourse and fostering diversity in the scientific community.We suspect that disparities are even larger at an earlier point in science dissemination, when journalists are selecting which research papers to report. Understanding these disparities is complicated by decades or even centuries of bias ingrained in the whole science production pipeline, including  whose research gets funded ,  who gets to publish in top journals  and  who is represented in the scientific workforce itself .Journalists are picking from a later stage of a process that has a number of inequities built in. Thus, addressing disparities in scientists' media representation is only one way to foster inclusivity and equality in science. But it's a step toward sharing scientific knowledge with the public in a more equitable way.Hao Peng  is a postdoctoral fellow at the Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University.This story comes from  The Conversation,  a nonprofit, independent news organization dedicated to unlocking the knowledge of experts for the public good.

Juliana Kim,"A year after withdrawing from the Masters tournament due to a  serious foot injury , Tiger Woods returned with a vengeance this week and made history just two days into the tournament. On Friday, the 48-year-old superstar golfer made the cut for the 24th consecutive time — setting a new record at the major golf championship. Making the cut also means Woods will advance to the second half of the tournament in Augusta, Ga.""It means I have a chance going into the weekend,"" Woods told reporters. ""I'm here. I have a chance to win the golf tournament.""Prior to breaking the record this week, Woods shared the title of 23 straight cuts with Fred Couples and Gary Player. On Friday, Woods joked that he planned to text Couples and tease about the record. ""As soon as I'm done with you guys, will text Freddie and give him a little needle,"" Woods said. The five-time Masters champion finished with a 1-over-par 73 on Friday's opening and then, an even-par 72 in the second round. Woods stood 1-under through 13 holes on Thursday before play was suspended due to harsh weather conditions. Woods withdrew last year during the third round of the tournament after experiencing serious pain in his foot. Videos from the golf course showed Woods limping and deeply uncomfortable during the rounds — signaling that he was still very much recovering from a serious car accident in 2021. The collision in Los Angeles left him with several injuries requiring extensive leg surgery. Shortly after his withdrawal from the Masters last year, Woods underwent ankle fusion surgery. Now, in his 26th Masters, Woods is not only competing for the illustrious green jacket and large sum of money but to show that his talent can outshine his ailments. He'll be doing so on a course near and dear to him. ""I've always loved playing here,"" he said. ""I've been able to play here since I was 19 years old. It's one of the honors I don't take lightly, being able to compete.""",2024-04-13 20:17:00 PM EEST,NPR,"Tiger Woods sets Masters record, making 24th consecutive cut",https://www.npr.org/2024/04/13/1244587828/tiger-woods-masters-cut-record
Nurith Aizenman,"Editor's note: This story contains detailed descriptions of how starvation affects the body.Famine has been a threat to humanity since ancient times.But it wasn't until the end of World War II that scientists began to investigate what starvation actually does to a person's body.Now aid advocates are calling for those lessons to be applied to today's food emergencies including the crises in Sudan, Gaza and Haiti.<h2>Lessons from World War II</h2>To understand why,  Alex de Waal , a social scientist at Tufts University who specializes in famines, says you need to go back to an episode that sparked modern study of the subject: The moment at the end of World War II when Allied forces liberated the concentration camps that the Nazis had set up to exterminate Jews and kill millions of others. The survivors of these camps were emaciated.""American and British soldiers rushed to feed [them],"" says de Waal. ""Then had seen to their dismay that many of them actually perished.""It turned out starvation had thrown the survivors' biological functions so out of whack, their bodies couldn't handle starting up regular eating.""It's called the re-feeding syndrome,"" says de Waal.In the years since, researchers have uncovered a lot of the reasons behind it. For instance, when someone is suffering from severe acute malnutrition, ""blood sugar levels and electrolyte levels can be volatile,"" says de Waal. ""And simply feeding regular foodstuffs can actually upset those balances"" – with sometimes deadly consequences.Scientists also discovered some long term impacts of extreme malnutrition by studying another grim chapter of the Second World War: A famine during Germany's occupation of the Netherlands that's often referred to as the Dutch ""hunger winter,"" when the Nazis blocked food supplies. Many of the survivors participated in follow-up studies for decades. The findings, says de Waal: ""The children who were very young when they suffered malnutrition grew up stunted — they were appreciably shorter than their elder or younger siblings.""They also showed cognitive deficits, did less well in school and went on to have more health problems as adults.By the 1980s additional research on brain development helped explain why young children are so vulnerable to this kind of lasting effect, says  Anu Narayan , a senior adviser at UNICEF who coordinates its response to food emergencies affecting children.""We now know that, really for children, under two years of age is when you're forming most of your neural pathways,"" says Narayan.And a young child's stomach is very small.""So the frequency with which they need to eat, and the quality of nutrition with each of the foods that they're eating, needs to be higher.""This means that even in the earliest stages of a food crisis, as families shift from consuming vegetables and proteins toward grains that are cheaper but less nutritious, ""the child starts losing weight pretty rapidly.""It's the symptom of acute malnutrition often referred to as ""wasting.""""That's when we see the quietness in the children. They'll become very, very quiet,"" says Narayan.Their bodies are reserving energy for only the most basic functions.Soon, even those bodily functions start to break down – often beginning with the regulation of fluid, says Narayan. ""Children's bellies will get distended. There is accumulation of fluid in their feet and their extremities.""Their immune system also begins to suffer, and children often succumbs to diarrheal and respiratory infections.They become too weak to stand up.""At that stage,"" says Narayan, ""they absolutely need medical care.""And aid groups have gotten really skilled at providing that kind of care.For example, de Waal notes, in 1974 there was a massive famine in Bangladesh. In the aftermath, ""nutritionists in South Asia developed very low-cost technologies for providing therapeutic feeding and salts and sugars for malnourished children."" By the 1990s, he adds, clinicians had developed sophisticated protocols for how to use them.<h2>Why help is now harder to give</h2>Today, says de Waal, there's a new challenge: In an increasing number of hunger crises, aid workers who can provide that kind of specialized care are unable to get in due to ongoing conflicts.UNICEF's Narayan agrees. Right now, she says, ""the largest number of children at risk is in Sudan.""World experts project that in Sudan, nearly 4 million children under age 5 will suffer from acute malnutrition this year. And 730,000 of them will reach the life-threatening stage.Also worrying, says Narayan is Northern Gaza, because of how quickly malnutrition has spread through the population. A data team led by UNICEF estimates that more than 21,000 young children there are now acutely malnourished — with about 4,400 at a point where, without medical intervention ""they will not survive.""In short, says Narayan, for all the scientific progress on bringing people back from the brink of starvation, ""when our access is limited, those are the children that we're likely to lose.""",2024-04-19 22:33:00 PM EEST,NPR,What World War II taught us about how to help starving people today,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2024/04/19/1245553753/starvation-malnutrition-holocaust
"Destinee Adams,Michel Martin","Treating gunshot wounds on children was not what Mikael Petrosyan expected when he entered pediatrics.Petrosyan has been working as a pediatric surgeon at the Children's National Hospital for more than a decade, and he has treated many children injured by guns. He hasn't been able to save them all and has had to tell parents that their children have died from gunshot wounds. ""It's a devastating thing to do, to lose a child for something that has been caused by guns,"" Petrosyan said. ""It's not an accident. It was totally preventable in many ways.""Last year, 106 juveniles were registered as gun shot wound victims in Washington D.C., and 16 of those incidents were fatal, according to the Metropolitan Police Department. Law enforcement in D.C. also recovered  more than 3,000 firearms in both 2022 and 2023 .Petrosyan says having to tell a parent their child has died from gunshot wounds is one of the most difficult parts of his job.Gun violence, including homicides, suicides and unintentional injuries, is the  leading cause of death  among American children and teens, ages 1-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Last year,  1,682 children and teens were shot and killed  and 4,512 were injured — excluding the number of gun related suicides.As Petrosyan sees it, the physical damage is just the beginning.""There's a lot of damage, not just physical, but psychological and emotional,"" Petrosyan said. ""I'm talking about families and people that are involved, not only parents, family, but also people who are treating the children. They are psychologically impacted significantly.""His colleagues are also feeling the strain to the point that some have stopped working temporarily for relief. Some are even considering early retirement or leaving the field altogether. Petrosyan sat with  Morning Edition 's Michel Martin to discuss his experience as someone who regularly witnesses the effects of gun violence on U.S. youth as part of our ongoing series,  We, The Voters . This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Michel Martin: Little kids aren't — they're not supposed to be injured. Mikael Petrosyan: They're not supposed to be injured. A lot of times they are bystanders. Most of the time they're innocent bystanders, 99.9% of the time. I'm not a politician, but we have to do better than what we have right now. It's not stable. It's not right. There's something we're not doing right.Martin: Most people don't go into pediatrics thinking we're going to be treating gun violence. I mean, it's just I think that's fair to say, right? Petrosyan: Correct. Martin: So, can you just talk about how it affects you and the people you work with, your colleagues, the nurses, the staff, the other doctors?Petrosyan: It does affect us, operating on kids. It's a job that comes with stress. I have three young kids and I go home every day, and I worry about this every day. And I text my wife, 'Are they OK? Was the school OK?' It doesn't matter where you live. Every day I think about it. I drive here every day, I think about it. So, these are things that will never leave me. I wish it did. And it causes stress on everyone. People think you're a surgeon, you're tough, but there's a lot of things associated with it.Martin: Is there something you particularly want people to know who don't see what you see?Petrosyan: People have to understand that we created this problem. It wasn't there before. We've created it. So we have to do something, not just lock the guns. It's not just that. It's education. It's community involvement. It's improving the socioeconomic status of people, communities. We have to do better as Americans, as everyone, as a family. When you lose a child on an operating table in an emergency room, it's devastating. You can't even talk or eat or do anything, many days. It's devastating, and I wouldn't want to wish on anyone. And imagine, as a parent, losing a child. How can you say to the parent that you lost their child? It's one of the most difficult things I've done in my career. It's when you go out there after the trauma resuscitation or an operation, and tell the parents, I'm sorry I couldn't save your child. It wasn't me that caused it, but I feel the responsibility that I wasn't able to save.Martin: Can I ask you if you've ever thought about it? If you've ever thought, 'I can't, I can't do it. This has to stop?'Petrosyan: Not yet.

None,"LOS ANGELES — The University of Southern California further shook up its commencement plans Friday, announcing the cancellation of a keynote speech by filmmaker Jon M. Chu just days after making the controversial choice to  disallow the student valedictorian from speaking .The private university in Los Angeles on Monday said it was  canceling valedictorian Asna Tabassum's speech  at the May 10 ceremony because of safety concerns. Tabassum, who is Muslim, has expressed support for Palestinians in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, and university officials said the response to her selection as valedictorian had ""taken on an alarming tenor."" They did not cite any specific threats.The university's decision was met with praise from pro-Israel organizations but condemnation from free speech groups and the Council on American-Islamic Relations. Students and faculty marched across campus Thursday in silent protest of the university's decision.Now, university officials say they are ""redesigning"" the entire commencement program.""Given the highly publicized circumstances surrounding our main-stage commencement program, university leadership has decided it is best to release our outside speakers and honorees from attending this year's ceremony,"" the university said in an unsigned statement posted Friday. ""We've been talking to this exceptional group and hope to confer these honorary degrees at a future commencement or other academic ceremonies.""Chu was slated to deliver the keynote address at the May 10 ceremony. He is a 2003 graduate of the university who has since directed films like ""Crazy Rich Asians"" and ""Wicked,"" an adaptation for the Broadway musical set for release last this year.More than 65,000 people are expected to gather on campus for commencement, including 19,000 graduates.""Although this should have been a time of celebration for my family, friends, professors, and classmates, anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian voices have subjected me to a campaign of racist hatred because of my uncompromising belief in human rights for all,"" Tabassum said in a statement earlier this week.The Israel-Hamas war has presented a challenge for colleges under pressure to preserve free speech and open debate, and campuses are expected to be further tested as commencement speeches get underway in the coming weeks.At Columbia University on Thursday, New York police  removed a pro-Palestinian protest encampment  and arrested more than 100 demonstrators. Most of them were charged with trespassing at the Ivy League-institution.Several students involved in the protest said they also were suspended from Columbia and nearby Barnard College. The school said it was still identifying students involved in the protest and added more suspensions would be forthcoming.""Students have a right to free speech but do not have a right to violate university policies and disrupt learning on campus,"" said New York Mayor Eric Adams, who said the city was asked by university officials to remove the encampment.",2024-04-20 07:19:00 AM EEST,NPR,USC cancels filmmaker's keynote amid controversy over canceled valedictorian speech,https://www.npr.org/2024/04/20/1246072697/usc-cancels-graduation-keynote-filmmaker
Chloe Veltman,"Salvador Dalí was known for his surreal artworks featuring melting clocks and craggy desert backgrounds, his eccentric behaviors like driving a car packed to the roof with cauliflower, and his gravity-defying mustache.He was also known for answering questions in cryptic ways. In 1966, when an  interviewer with the CBC  asked the artist if he thought he was crazy, Dalí's response was: ""Dalí is almost crazy. But the only difference between crazy people and Dalí is Dalí is not crazy.""Now, visitors to the  Dalí Museum  in St. Petersburg, Fla., have the opportunity to ask any question they like of the famed surrealist artist who died in 1989.Ask Dalí , a new installation based on a copy of Dalí's iconic  Lobster Telephone  sculpture, allows visitors to pick up the crustacean-shaped receiver, ask a question, and hear Dalí's response. The artist's voice, speaking in heavily-accented English, is made possible through generative artificial intelligence.""Why are the clocks melting?"" is an example of one question someone asks in a promotional  reel  for the installation, which opened on April 11. ""My dear questioner! Think not of the clocks as merely melting. Picture them as a vast dream.""<h2>Bringing Dalí's voice to life through AI</h2>According to  Goodby Silverstein & Partners , the San Francisco-based ad agency that collaborated on the installation with the Dalí Museum, the artist's AI voice was trained on voice samples taken from archival interviews Dalí did in English over his career. (He spoke four languages — Catalan, Spanish, French and English — sometimes interchangeably.)The underlying model is OpenAI's GPT-4. Because GPT-4 is trained on almost all publicly available text, this model includes extensive information about Dalí — an artist with a vast presence on the internet. The Dalí Museum also selected English translations of Dalí's writings in other languages, including his  Mystical Manifesto ,  Diary of a Genius  and  The Secret Life of Salvador Dalí .""These have formed the basis of Dalí's words and tone of voice through careful prompt engineering, refining and testing,"" said Martin Pagh Ludvigsen, Goodby Silverstein & Partners' director of creative technology & AI, in an email to NPR.Ludvigsen said the AI Dalí has answered more than 3,000 questions so far. ""People ask big questions about life, love and death from Dalí,"" Ludvigsen said, adding he is able to monitor the AI's answers, but not the visitors' specific questions. The AI ""frequently speaks of [Dalí's] wife Gala when discussing love — 'My marriage to Gala was an exquisite tapestry of love, beyond the binaries of mortal understanding,' just popped up in the tool."" Ludvigsen said the AI has also responded to questions about why humans kill animals: ""A question soaked in existential dread yet trivial in the grand canvas of the cosmos. We kill animals perhaps because we are imprisoned in a labyrinth of primal instincts and modern desires, a surreal dance of survival and supremacy."" On why there is so much darkness in the world: ""Challenge the universe with deeper queries, like why do shadows celebrate the sun? Shadows celebrate the sun because they are the silent music of light's absence. Each shadow is a dark fingerprint of the universe, revealing the hidden contours of time and space.""Another frequent topic, according to Ludvigsen, is the  Lobster Telephone  itself. Dalí fashioned at least 10 of the objects in the 1930s. The work is constructed out of an old-fashioned rotary telephone and a plaster lobster. Some versions are all in white — the Dalí Museum in St. Petersburg owns one of these — while others, like the one at The Tate in London, feature a black phone with a red lobster.<h2>From Dalí to DALL-E</h2>This is the latest in an string of tech-infused installations at the Dalí museum. Beginning in 2019, the AI installation  Dalí­ Lives  allowed visitors to interact with Dalí's likeness on a series of screens throughout the museum. Since last year, the interactive installation  Dream Tapestry   has allowed visitors to create original digital paintings from a text description of a dream.Dalí scholar  Elliott King , an associate professor of art history at Washington and Lee University who was not involved with the museum's exhibit, said he thought Dalí would have liked this AI-based interpretation of his voice and work, noting that the popular AI image generator DALL-E is in part inspired by the artist's name. ""He was so interested in scientific advancements,"" King said. ""I think that he would have been really tickled by people talking into this lobster phone.""King said he thought the AI-generated voice worked well compared to the museum's previous efforts. ""It does sound much more like Dalí than anything that I've heard up until now,"" King said. ""His voice is so unusual. He had a very particular way of speaking where he would exaggerate certain words.""But King said some of the AI answers did not sound authentic to Dalí's creative language. King cited the ""Why are the clocks melting?"" question, and its response, ""Picture them as a vast dream,"" as an example. ""That's a little bit vague,"" King said. ""He's never just going to say something nearly so mundane. It's always going to be much more action-packed, much more exciting than just the regular thing that somebody might say.""(After this article was published, Ludvigsen said in an email that the AI's answer to the ""melting clocks"" question in the teaser video is not the full answer the AI gave and was from an early version of the AI that has since been refined.)King said that in Dalí's 1934 book  The Conquest of the Irrational , Dalí describes the melting timepieces as ""the soft, extravagant, solitary paranoiac-critical Camembert of time and space."" ""To be fair, Dalí altered his interpretations of the soft clocks many times throughout his life,"" King said. ""In the 1950s, they were atomic; in the 1960s, they were prognosticators of DNA. But saying they are part of a 'vast dream' almost sounds too clear.""King also said Dalí would never use the word ""hi"" when introducing himself, which is what the AI model does when the museum-goer picks up the lobster phone to speak to the AI surrealist. ""That word sounds so odd coming out of his voice,"" King said. ""He always said, ""Bonjour!"" — always the French — even to say goodbye.""",2024-04-21 20:08:00 PM EEST,NPR,An AI Salvador Dalí will answer any question when called on his famous 'lobster phone',https://www.npr.org/2024/04/21/1246117954/salvador-dali-artificial-intelligence-lobster-telephone-museum
Linda Holmes,"HBO's  The Jinx ,  which aired in 2015 (yes, nine years ago), was a huge contributor to the true-crime boom in television and audio. It came out the same year as Netflix's  Making a Murderer   and only a few months after the first season of the podcast  Serial . Few later attempts have been as successful, though, because they lack  The Jinx 's secret weapon: the participation of the extraordinarily strange, compulsively talkative, and now deceased subject, Robert Durst. The story of the docuseries goes like this: Durst had long been suspected in both the disappearance of his wife, Kathie, in 1982 and the shooting death of his best friend, Susan Berman, in 2000. He had admitted shooting his neighbor, Morris Black, in 2001 but was acquitted by a jury on a theory of self-defense. For reasons known only to himself, Durst chose  to live out his life as an ultrawealthy real estate tycoon, but also to sit for long interviews with director Andrew Jarecki for  The Jinx  to discuss the alleged crimes. These interviews were what made  The Jinx  so compelling. Durst could not stop himself from talking, even when staying silent was obviously in his best interests. This extended to a hot-mic incident that Jarecki treated as a bombshell confession, even though it turned out to be a  bit more complicated than that . The day before the finale aired, Durst was arrested for the murder of Berman, based in part on evidence that the documentarians had uncovered and provided to law enforcement. This follow-up series essentially covers his trial and the time leading up to it. But it, too, lacks the punch that Durst's presence offered the original.There are some things about the self-referential nature of this second chapter that are a little unpleasant.  The Jinx  is now part of the story of Durst's life after his arrest. The filmmakers show some footage of the series finale viewing party they held in 2015 for (among others) the family of the disappeared first wife Durst is suspected of having killed. We watch their (apparent) relief and gratitude when the ""confession"" is played. Not shown: the incident  reported in  The New York Times   in which another guest at the same party (Rosie O'Donnell, for whatever reason) immediately demanded to know why the filmmakers would have withheld this evidence from law enforcement to use it as the kicker to the show, a question that played out in the press as well, along with some  other tough questions about the making of   The Jinx . But the way the viewing party is shown in  Part Two , nobody felt anything but vindicated and thankful. It seems questionable to set up a viewing party for a putative victim's family and film their reaction to your big reveal about her murder, and a bit sketchy to omit parts where people weren't sure you were doing the good deed you think you were doing. Ethically, those things raise some questions. But as television, the biggest problem with the episodes HBO provided to critics (four out of what will eventually be six) is that they're pretty boring. Without Durst's involvement (it seems that he finally stopped participating in documentary-making after he was arrested and died shortly after his conviction), the series often seems to be grasping for revelations. It's also heavily reliant on reenactments, which aren't particularly visually interesting and look a lot like every other true-crime reenactment on TV. The third episode is the best of the four; without spoiling it, it sheds a bit of additional light on the back story, if you're still looking for it. But what  The Jinx – Part Two  reveals is that  The Jinx  was interesting because while Durst might be a murderer, he was also a gruesomely fascinating interview subject. While there's tape here of phone calls from when he was incarcerated, and sometimes you get those ""Bob being Bob"" moments, the mesmerizing aspects of the original are not there.There's no telling what might come in the final two episodes; perhaps they have more to say, and that's why they were held back from critics. The big revelations in  The Jinx  came in the last two episodes, after all. But in the meantime, this feels like a mystery show in search of a mystery, a true crime series with limited truths to share. This piece also appeared in NPR's Pop Culture Happy Hour newsletter.

It's incredibly cute and sweet and funny. It's written by Shenee Howard. The episodes are about half an hour long — super easy, delightful, and so cheery.  — Joelle Monique<h2>on Broadway</h2>I am delighted to say that the revival of  The Wiz  has brought me so much joy. I saw it in previews and it just opened on Broadway. It is a multicultural, multicolored delight. Folks who go to see it will be clamoring for the cast recording album because, more than anything, I think what stuck with me is just the wonderful vocal arrangements and orchestrations from this new version. I think people will really enjoy it.  — Soraya Nadia McDonald<h2>Balatro</h2>Balatro  is a deck building video game, which means it's basically poker that you play by yourself. You're dealt this hand, and then you try to build straights and flushes and things of a kind, etc. What makes it addictive is its elegant simplicity: Between hands you get a chance to buy random Jokers and other cards that do different things. And as you go through each run, the amount of points you can get, you have to earn on that hand increase. So, once you don't make it, that's it. You start over, your Jokers go away, you start from zero. You keep playing, and playing, and playing, because moments happen when the Jokers you have assembled interact with each other, and when they do, you see the points multiplying exponentially and you feel completely invulnerable. Producer Liz Metzger mentioned this game so I checked it out and when I looked up, it was the next day.  — Glen Weldon<h2>More recommendations from the</h2>by Linda HolmesDon't miss  Elizabeth Blair's piece for NPR  marking the 50th anniversary of Redbone's  ""Come And Get Your Love.""  It was the first song by an all-Native and Mexican American band to make it into the Billboard Top 10, and she collects some terrific reminiscences. It's a really good piece both to read and to listen to. At six million views on YouTube, the dance video of  the CDK Company  interpreting Gotye's ""Somebody That I Used To Know""  is hardly a hidden gem. But the choreography is fascinating, and it's highly recommended if you're in the mood for a little mind-blowing movement. The Hulu series  Under The Bridge   is based on the true story of a Victoria, B.C. teenager who was killed after going off to meet a bunch of other teenagers. And while that's a dynamic that's been explored before (going back at least to  River's Edge ), this is also an opportunity for recent devotees of Lily Gladstone to see her play the cop who's determined to figure out what happened. Riley Keough plays a journalist who grew up in Victoria and has returned to write a book, only to get very much mixed up in the case.Beth Novey  adapted the Pop Culture Happy Hour segment ""What's Making Us Happy"" for the Web.

None,"Andrew Davis, an acclaimed British conductor who was music director of the Lyric Opera of Chicago and orchestras on three continents, has died. He was 80.Davis died Saturday at Rusk Institute in Chicago from leukemia, his manager, Jonathan Brill of Opus 3 Artists, said Sunday.Davis had been managing the disease for between 1 1/2 and 2 years, but it became acute shortly after his 80th birthday on Feb. 2. He had conducted the Chicago Symphony Orchestra last December in the U.S. premiere of his own orchestration of Handel's ""Messiah.""""A consummate musician, incredibly versatile and a phenomenal colleague, as well,"" soprano Renée Fleming said in an email to The Associated Press. ""It takes a special kind of command to be a great conductor, the power to make close to a hundred musicians (each one, at heart, a diva or divo) hang on your tiniest gesture. So it is remarkable that even with that strength, Andrew's primary quality was his innate happiness. He was gifted with an infectious joy that somehow came through in every bar of music he made.""As his 80th birthday approached, Davis was invigorated by the challenge of molding an orchestra, especially young players.""Harnessing all that energy and that enthusiasm and that passion, and galvanizing it into a totally, totally unified conception and not just conception but — what's the word? — realization,"" he said during an interview with the AP last July after rehearsing the National Youth Orchestra of the United States of America in workshops and then at New York's Carnegie Hall. ""I berate them more than I would, but I hope always with a twinkle in my eye.""Davis was music director of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra from 1975-88 and Britain's Glyndebourne Festival from 1988-2000; chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra from 1989-2000 and the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra from 2013-19; then music director of the Lyric Opera from 2000-21.Davis made his Lyric Opera debut in 1987 and led about 700 performances of 62 operas by 22 composers.""He was a true artistic partner to me and a shining light for so many of us,"" Lyric Opera general director Anthony Freud said in a statement. ""We will miss his incredible artistry, his extraordinary wisdom, his irrepressible humor, his unfettered zest for life and his devotion to the arts and the humanities.""Davis conducted a dozen Last Night of the Proms concerts, an annual celebration of Britain at London's Royal Albert Hall. He twice gave the customary speech in the patter of the Major General's song from Gilbert and Sullivan's ""The Pirates of Penzance.""Born in Ashridge, in the Hertfordshire county of England, Andrew Frank Davis played organ for his parish choir and joined the choir at the Watford Grammar School for Boys. He studied piano at London's Royal Academy of Music in London, became an organ student at King's College Cambridge, and played piano, harpsichord and organ with the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields from 1966-70.He made his conducting debut with the BBC Symphony in 1970, became an assistant conductor with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra and Philharmonia Orchestra, then in 1971 made his North American debut with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra.""One of the finest conductors of his generation,"" Carnegie Hall executive and artistic director Clive Gillinson said. ""I worked with him on an ongoing basis at the London Symphony Orchestra, and the players and I were always totally engaged by his superb musicianship.""Davis made his opera-conducting debut in Strauss' ""Capriccio"" at the Glyndebourne in 1973 and the following year met his future wife, soprano Gianna Rolandi, when she sang Zerbinetta in performances of Strauss' ""Ariadne auf Naxos"" that he led at New York's Metropolitan Opera. They got married in 1989 and had a son, composer Edward Frazier Davis.Davis became a Commander of the British Empire in 1992 and a Knight Bachelor in 1999. The family moved to Chicago when he was hired by the Lyric Opera.During the pandemic, Davis translated Virgil's ""Aeneid"" from Latin into English verse.""I took an entrance exam in classics in New College, Oxford,"" he told NPR, ""but then a couple of weeks later I took the organ scholarship trials at King's College, Cambridge, which much to my surprise I won, so that was the end of classics for me.""His wife died in 2021. In addition to his son, he is survived by a sister, Jill Atkins, and brothers Martin Davis and Tim Davis.

None,"<h2>1. A civil war for the silver screen</h2>Civil War,  the new A24 film from British director Alex Garland, imagines a scenario that might not seem so far-fetched to some;  a contemporary civil war breaking out in the United States.In this world, the U.S. has split into various factions. The president, played by Nick Offerman – has given himself a third term, and he's hoping to fend off an assault from one of the more powerful groups. In what might seem like the most unbelievable narrative twist,  California and Texas form an alliance to become the ""Western Forces""  and fight against Offerman's regime. Sure, I guess!<h2>2. How far are we from reality?</h2>NPR movie critic Bob Mondello says the movie doesn't do a lot of explaining to help us understand how the U.S. got to this moment. But he says that makes it stronger.""What became much more interesting in the moment was what it looks like to transpose things that we've always associated with other countries –  the bombed out helicopters and things like that – to place that in a J.C. Penney parking lot.""And while the film has taken heat for little mention of politics, the question of an actual civil war has everything to do with it. Polling has shown a significant minority thinks a civil war is at least somewhat likely in the next 10 years.   So what do the experts say?<h2>3. Division in the U.S.</h2>Amy Cooter is a director of research at the Center on Terrorism, Extremism, and Counterterrorism at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies. Her work has led her to the question that Garland's movie has put in the minds of both moviegoers and political pundits:  Could a second civil war really happen here? Cooter wants to make one thing clear: ""I don't think that civil war is imminent, but I think there are some people who wish we would have one, and wish that they could be effectively culture soldiers to re-enact a civil order that they see as better for them and their families.""In her studies of militias and political extremists, Cooter has observed  a movement of groups similar to those who joined in on the January 6th riots  who feel disconnected from the current political moment, or perhaps want to return to a previous version of society, that they feel served them better.And while Cooter doesn't think a civil war will be happening anytime soon, she does say this: ""I think we are at a moment of extreme political division that may get worse before it gets better.""",2024-04-20 00:38:00 AM EEST,NPR,Is this fictitious civil war closer to reality than we think?,https://www.npr.org/2024/04/19/1198911283/civil-war-film-real-life-us-far-right-militia-jan-6-possible
Jamal Michel,"The new video game Tales of Kenzera: ZAU opens with two grieving sons and a cleverly framed narrative. You start with Zuberi, a young man in an afro-futurist city, reading the story of Zau in a book his father left him before his demise. Moments later, you're transported through the story to the mythic past, watching Zau as he cries out, demanding that Kalunga, God of Death, restore his own fallen father to life. Kalunga appears to him, but not as a grim reaper might. Rather, he's a no-nonsense older man who tasks Zau with putting three Great Spirits to rest in return for his dad's life. Zau then journeys through fantastical biomes that range from deserts to jungles to volcanoes, all while he and Kalunga debate the meaning of the pain and death they encounter on the way. It's an odyssey through grief and a lesson in the power we wield in the face of indescribable loss. British actor Abubakar Salim, who voices Zau and Zuberi, provides a poignant performance that carries the story. Known for playing the protagonist of Assassin's Creed Origins, Salim founded developer Surgent Studios and based Tales of Kenzera: ZAU on the experience of losing his father. The game captures Salim's Kenyan roots and sheds light on the  Bantu culture he cherishes .  <h2>Learning from the best</h2>Salim has cited modern classics like Hollow Knight and Ori and the Will of the Wisps as inspiring the game's action gameplay. It's a sleek and smaller-scale ""Metroidvania,"" so named because Nintendo's Metroid and Konami's Castlevania set the early template for the genre. ZAU has all the staples. It's got characteristically sprawling levels that require you to backtrack to discover secrets enabled by new power-ups. But it's also got frictionless movement, frantic combat, and a lush soundtrack that soars in the game's dramatic boss fights.From enemies like the Tokoloshe and Kongamato, which represent chaos and brutality, to the Kivulian Woodlands, home to one of three Great Spirits Zau must subdue, the game presents a fierce and entrancing ecosystem. Thankfully, Zau's Masks of the Sun and Moon give him the firepower and speed he needs to overcome each challenge. You can switch between them at the tap of a button: the Moon offers quick ranged attacks, while the Sun enables heavier melee strikes. Brutish enemies with Spiritual Overshields require you to mix and match between the Sun or Moon to take them down. There is a skill tree, but it's pretty spare — both Sun and Moon paths have seven skills to choose from, requiring Shaman Points gained from bludgeoning the life out of baddies. Doing so will also fill up to two energy meters. You can spend one to heal or two to unleash ultimate attacks: the Sun Mask's Supernova summons a flaming tornado, while the Moon Mask's Lunar Blast takes a page out of Iron Man's book with a laser that cuts across the screen. While the game suffers from poor enemy variety, this combat system is simple and nearly perfect. I wish it gave you a slightly larger window to cancel attacks with a dash.Zipping around the game is nearly as smooth as its visuals. Early on, Zau races forward with a double jump and air dash. Later, he'll find a hook shot and powers like Tshukudu's Might, a special ability that allows him to burst forward to destroy barriers between levels. While the game could have benefited from better navigation features to assist with backtracking, like the snapshot system in  this year's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown , it's a joy to explore.  <h2>Laying to rest</h2>Through the game's four acts, Zau helps the characters he encounters, with each embodying a response to grief. It could be a young girl hoping to reunite with a lost Spirit, an exhausted warrior trying to find his missing son or a weary fellow shaman searching vainly for the ingredients to a restorative tonic. Throughout it all, Zau contends with Kalunga, God of Death, resisting his proffered wisdom as he seeks to do things his way. Each time, Zau finds healing, but rarely in the manner he expects.Tales of Kenzera: ZAU  isn't the first game to examine grief , but it's a standout among stories featuring Afro-futurism. It's tender with its protagonist and the restless spirits fighting him until they all come to terms with the weight of life, death and loss. The symbolism infused into masks, weapons and architecture speaks to the care Surgent Studios took in translating Bantu culture into a fantasy video game.  This journey transforms Zau and, through him, Zuberi. That meta structure invites players to consider how they'd deal with loss. Fortunately, I still have my father, but the game reminded me that our time is short. Tales of Kenzera: ZAU's brilliance comes from pairing this memento mori with a satisfying, familiar game genre. Even though it may not be as innovative as other Metroidvanias, its heart-rending acting and peerless presentation add up to a game I'll be thinking about for years to come.

Terry Gross,"It's a fundamental tension in a democracy: How do you have majority rule in a way that also protects minority rights? Journalist  Ari Berman  says the Founding Fathers struggled with that question back in 1787 — except, for them, white male landowners were the minority in need of protection.""Most of the founders were skeptical of the public's ability to elect the president directly,"" Berman says. ""So they created this very complicated situation in which electors would elect the president instead of the people electing the president directly.""In his new book,  Minority Rule , Berman connects the debates and compromises of the country's founders to contemporary politics. He says the founding fathers created a system that concentrated power in the hands of the elite and that today, institutions like the Electoral College and the Senate — designed as a check against the power of the majority — are having much the same effect.Berman notes that in the country's first presidential election, in 1789, only a small fraction of the population was eligible to vote — and in certain states, voters were only allowed to vote for electors, not the candidates themselves.Though the right to vote has since been expanded, Berman says the democratic process remains deeply flawed. He points out that in 2000 and again in 2016, the presidential candidate who won the popular vote did not win the electoral vote. Additionally, he says, because the Constitution stipulates that each state gets two senators, regardless of its population, ""smaller, whiter, more conservative states have far more power and representation in the Senate then larger, more diverse, more urban states.""""What we see right now is the same kind of thing, in which a privileged, conservative, white minority is trying to suppress the power of a much more diverse multiracial governing majority,"" Berman says. ""And that's a very dangerous situation for American democracy.""<h2>Interview highlights</h2>On the Constitution as a flawed documentWe venerate the Constitution as a civic religion. I think we would be much greater served to look at the Constitution as a whole document and say, there are some remarkable parts of this document, but there's also some really flawed parts of this document that we still haven't corrected. Because the really remarkable thing is that even as America has democratized in the centuries since — and nobody would argue that America isn't more democratic now than it was back then — some features of the Constitution have become more undemocratic.On the creation of the Electoral College to uphold minority rule Most of the founders were skeptical of the public's ability to elect the president directly. They felt like the public would be uninformed, or it would be chosen by the largest states, or would be chosen by free states in a way that would hurt the South. So it's interesting, one of the themes that runs through the book and runs through the founding is that these smaller minorities wanted protection. And when I may say smaller minorities, I don't mean minority groups. I mean the small states wanted protection, the slave states wanted protection, and they felt like they would get that protection in the Electoral College. So they created this very complicated situation in which electors would elect the president instead of the people electing the president directly.On how representatives from Delaware scuffled the initial plan to have Senate representation being based on population James Madison and other prominent framers wanted the Senate to be based on proportional representation, so they wanted it to be based on population. So larger states like Virginia would have more representation than smaller states like Delaware. But the smaller states rebelled. And there's this amazing moment at the Constitutional Convention where the attorney general of Delaware gets up and he tells the likes of James Madison, if you don't give us the same representation, we're going to find a foreign ally who we're going to join with instead, and we're going to leave the United States of America. And that was a stunning demand. The idea that they would go rejoin England or they would join France instead, if they didn't have the same level of representation, meant that the larger states had no choice but to give in to the demand of the smaller states to ratify the Constitution.But what Madison worried about is that it would allow what he called a more objectionable minority than ever to control the U.S. Senate, because if the smaller states had the same level of representation as the larger states, that was inevitably going to lead to minority rule. And Madison worried that would get worse as more states join the union. And, of course, that's what's happened today, where the gap between large and small states is dramatically larger than it was back in 1787.On how the two Senator per state representation affects minority rule Just to give you one really  stunning stat , by 2040, 70% of the population is going to live in 15 states with 30 senators. That means that 30% of the country, which is going to be whiter, more rural, more conservative, is going to elect 70% of the U.S. Senate. So the trend in the U.S. Senate is becoming more imbalanced and more undemocratic. And what's really interesting to me is a lot of conservatives want to go back and they want to quote the framers, but they ignore that a lot of the framers, including James Madison, the architect of the Constitution, had grave concerns about some of the institutions they were creating, particularly the structure of the U.S. Senate.

Nathan Rott,"In the original version of the popular board game Settlers of Catan, players start on an undeveloped island and are encouraged to ""fulfill your manifest destiny."" To win you have to collect resources and develop, claiming land by building settlements, cities, and roads.A new version of the board game,  Catan: New Energies , introduces a 21st-century twist — pollution. Expand responsibly or lose. In the new version, modern Catan needs energy. To get that energy players have to build power plants, and those plants can run on renewable energy or fossil fuels. Power plants operated on fossil fuels allow you to build faster but also create more pollution. Too much pollution causes catastrophes.""Generally it's tough to depict reality in a game. The reality is always so much more complex,"" said Benjamin Teuber, managing director of Catan's production company and co-developer of the new game. Games, he adds, need to be fun.The newest iteration of Catan will hit shelves this summer. And it aims to mirror reality in a couple of clear ways: Energy from fossil fuels creates  more planet-altering pollution  than renewables; too much pollution leads to  bad things ; those bad things are  felt unequally .""Sometimes flooding hits everybody, just as we see [in the real world],"" said Teuber. ""It doesn't matter who created the pollution. It affects everyone.""Teuber, who co-developed New Energies with his late dad, Klaus Teuber, said the game was an old idea they dusted off during the Covid-19 pandemic. It's one that's become increasingly relevant as the real world grapples with the effects of real pollution: a rapidly warming planet that's worsening wildfires, floods, and heatwaves.The game's developers are aware of the relevancy. ""It's a very interesting topic in every culture that we publish in,"" Teuber said.Polls show climate change is viewed as  a major concern  across many parts of the world. But adapting to the changes and addressing its roots  have proven difficult . Teuber said he thinks board games can help move the conversation forward. Board games generally require people to sit around a shared table, to read each other, to negotiate and take risks, ""without having a severe and bad consequence,"" he said. ""Unless divorce is the result.""Climate change experienced through board gamesCatan: New Energies is not the only new board game centered on climate change.  Daybreak , the latest game from the creator of Pandemic, a popular cooperative board game, tasks players with working together to cut carbon emissions and limit global warming.In a blog post on Daybreak's website, the game's co-designer Matteo Menapace wrote that he and co-creator Matt Leacock were inspired to make the game because they were both worried about climate change and weren't sure what to do about it.""The problem with the question 'what can I do about climate change,' is how it implies climate action is like a single-player game, with you alone fighting against this huge invisible enemy,""  Menapace wrote . They believe addressing climate change and its causes will require a collective effort. That's why Daybreak requires ""total cooperation,"" Menapace wrote. ""It's a big leap from the current state of climate (in)action, but not an unreasonable one... and we aim for this game to play a role in accelerating this shift.""Catan Studio, the developer and publisher of Catan games, isn't as explicit in its intentions with its new game. The phrase ""climate change"" doesn't show up in any of the Catan: New Energies' promotional materials, packaging, or rulebooks. ""Pollution"" is the catch-all term for the problem.Teuber said they talked about adding the term but decided to focus on energy and presenting players with the option of fossil fuels or renewable. ""We assume players will draw their own conclusions as they engage with the game,"" he said.    The game's studio does note in its press materials that according to ""evidence-based research and expert sources, [the] new game elements will get players thinking and talking about important issues.""A 2019 review of published  research on board games  and behavior by a team of Japanese researchers showed that ""as a tool, board games can be expected to improve the understanding of knowledge, enhance interpersonal interactions among participants, and increase the motivation of participants."" Though, it noted, the number of published studies on the topic is limited.Dialogue from gameplay ""What games are really powerful at is starting dialogues,"" said Sam Illingworth, an associate professor of science communication at Edinburgh Napier University in the UK.In the gaming world, there's a concept called the Magic Circle — a theory attributed to Johann Huizinga, a Dutch cultural historian, who  in the 1930's  posited that play creates a separate world with separate rules.""It's the idea that we suspend disbelief on the gaming table,"" Illingworth said. ""Like in the game Monopoly, it's perfectly good – strictly advisable – for me to want to bankrupt you, which is behavior that's morally repugnant away from the gaming table, but it means that those social hierarchies can break down and we can have conversations that we wouldn't normally be able to have.""In 2019, Illingworth co-designed a playable expansion to the original Catan that added climate change and sustainability to the gameplay. They called it  Catan: Global Warming  and posted the rules and instructions on how to adapt a regular Catan game online.In the add-on, if players add too many greenhouse gasses, the whole island is destroyed and nobody wins. ""So that creates a game state where psychologically there's obvious causality between actions and what happens, right?"" Illingworth said. ""So rather than just having a conversation about what might happen, you're actually experiencing it.""In Catan: New Energies, if pollution reaches too high a level to continue, the win goes to the person who built the most renewable energy power plants.While workshopping the new game with colleagues, Teuber said they would often play too aggressively, aiming to ""grow, grow, grow,"" they would build out fossil fuel power plants, he said. ""We always manage to over pollute.""Test groups did the same. But after those games, the players would often come back and say, ""We had heavy discussions afterwards,"" Teuber said. ""We all felt kind of bad, we learned and thing or two, and the next game we played differently.""",2024-04-22 12:30:00 PM EEST,NPR,How do you build without over polluting?

Elizabeth Blair,"PEN America has cancelled its annual literary awards ceremony after nearly half of the writers and translators nominated withdrew their books from consideration.The awards will still be granted to those who did not withdraw, though the ceremony, which was scheduled for Monday, April 29 in New York, will not go on. Writer and comedian Jena Friedman had been lined up to host the event.An open  letter  signed by a number of writers to PEN America's leadership reads, ""We reject these honors conferred by your organization in protest of your failure to confront the genocide in Gaza.""They contend that PEN America was slow to denounce ""the incomparable loss of Palestinian life"" and that when the organization finally did, its statement lacked ""proportional empathy."" The Israel-Hamas war has killed over 34,000 Palestinians, according to health officials in Gaza. Israel invaded Gaza in response to an attack by the militant organization Hamas on Oct. 7 that killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians. ""We greatly respect that writers have followed their consciences, whether they chose to remain as nominees in their respective categories or not,"" said Clarisse Rosaz Shariyf, PEN America's head of literary programming, in a statement. ""As an organization dedicated to freedom of expression and writers, our commitment to recognizing and honoring outstanding authors and the literary community is steadfast."" In February, Palestinian-American writer Randa Jarrar was  dragged  out of a PEN America event in Los Angeles after she and other writers used a portable speaker to play the names of writers and poets killed in Gaza. The event featured actor Mayim Bialik, who has supported Israel on social media. The PEN America awards come with different-sized cash prizes. The foundation behind the PEN/Jean Stein Book Award said that Stein was a ""passionate advocate for Palestinian rights"" and said that it had directed PEN to donate the unawarded $75,000 to the Palestine Children's Relief Fund. PEN  said  that winners who did not withdraw from consideration will receive their cash prizes, including playwright and screenwriter Tony Kushner, who will be honored with the PEN/Mike Nichols Writing for Performance Award.

Barbara J. King,"Just as spring begins to show its annual gifts of rejuvenation — and as we celebrate Earth Day — two new books offer reflections on ways that watching birds can renew our joy in nature, and maybe even transform our lives.In  Birding to Change the World , environmental justice educator Trish O'Kane recounts lessons from birds that have galvanized her teaching and activism in Wisconsin and Vermont. And, hitting shelves Tuesday, novelist Amy Tan in  The Backyard Bird Chronicles  tightens the focus in describing and drawing the array of birds that visit her yard in California.The author of  The Joy Luck Club ,  The Valley of Amazement  and other novels, Tan makes a glorious success of this venture into non-fiction. The book consists of journal entries from 2017 through 2022 that recount her observations of the behavior of oak titmice, golden crowned sparrows, California scrub jays, Anna's hummingbirds and other birds, coupled with her drawings of them. The entire package is enchanting, all the more so because Tan peppers the pages with questions about what she is seeing.One day, from inside her house, Tan noticed a female house finch flying back and forth just outside the glass door, while looking directly at her. One feeder was full of seeds, and the bird sat there but did not eat. Another feeder nearby, devoted to highly favored sunflower seeds, was empty. ""Could this bird possibly be signaling that I should refill its favorite feeder?"" Tan wondered. She did refill it, and the finch ""immediately went to the feeder and ate and ate and ate.""I love Tan's curiosity and openness to possibilities about birds, who are much smarter than often credited. (In keeping with this good message of hers, all the better to avoid ""it"" when referring to a bird individual, especially when the bird's sex is known.)Another day, an unfamiliar bird showed up. Tan scrutinized the bird's markings and worked through the process of identification. ""I went giddy in the brain,"" she remembers. ""It was an American Tree Sparrow. But how could that be?"" These birds are unexpected in California. Would the bird try to rejoin other American tree sparrows? Could the bird become disoriented and die?""With both fiction and birds,"" Tan writes, ""I think about existence, the span of life, from conception to birth to survival to death to remembrance by others.""When she began this project, Tan could recognize precisely three birds in her yard. Now, the count is 63 species. I deeply share her joy at this later-in-life learning curve: In 2023, I counted 43 bird species in our little patch of land in southeastern Virginia.Tan's playful humor strays into outright anthropomorphism at times: ""I want tourist junk food!"" declares a baby crow she has drawn. This fanciful tone only brings extra warmth to a magnificently written and illustrated volume.Author Trish O'Kane is entranced with American woodcocks. These birds resemble ""a football with wings"" and walk awkwardly on land. They rely heavily on earthworms as a diet mainstay. Their main call, termed peenting, is a ""strange buzzing that sounds like a giant insect being squashed."" In the air, they fly in intricate spirals.Woodcocks, American bitterns, sandhill cranes, Canada geese, and catbirds are just some of the 134 bird species that inhabit Warner Park in Madison, Wisconsin, in addition to numerous species of mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and insects. Yet every July 4th beginning in the 1990s — long before O'Kane arrived in Madison to begin graduate school — the park had hosted a conflagration of fireworks and noise called Rhythm and Booms.At this event, attended by 100,000 people, cannons were fired and five tons of fireworks exploded. Birds are known to feel ""panic and even pain"" from such thunderous noise; some abandon nests or even die of fright. Heavy metal residues from the fireworks soaked the park's soil.This tradition outraged O'Kane, as did plans to further develop the park beyond its existing sports fields. With a background in environmental justice and investigative journalism, O'Kane recognized that Warner Park was at even extra risk because it bordered low-income neighborhoods; white folks in power weren't much concerned with nature opportunities for people of color. She oriented her dissertation around questions of social justice: Why couldn't a park in a lower-income neighborhood also be a protected place for wildlife?O'Kane carried out interdisciplinary research; collaborated with local nature lovers to form an activist group called Wild Warner; and educated students from middle school to college age about the park. (A laudable endeavor, though I can't comprehend why O'Kane supported the process of teaching kids to fish since many fishes, like birds, have intricate social lives.)Tirelessly working together, a team of park lovers brought evidence forward to local authorities about the ongoing harms to the park, including violations to the Clean Water Act and poisoning of the birds' environment — highlighting the delightful woodcocks who were eating the park's toxin-laced earthworms. The authorities listened: Rhythm and Booms was moved out of the park and damaged areas of the park were restored to prairie.O'Kane's story is richer in scope than I can convey here. It begins in New Orleans at the time of Hurricane Katrina and ends in Vermont, where she teaches today. Her book is a beautiful love letter to local activism and especially to the birds who teach her so much. Canada geese, for example, ""provided a perfect organizing and leadership model."" As the geese flock in the air, they ""synchronize their flapping and switch position constantly... It seems geese have found the solution to activist burnout.""Tan and O'Kane invite us to see the beauty of birds in our world and to act for their well-being. We need their voices in this spring's chorus.Barbara J. King is a biological anthropologist emerita at William & Mary.

Samantha Balaban,"George Takei was just 4 years old when when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066:""I hereby authorize and direct the Secretary of War, and the Military Commanders... to prescribe military areas in such places and of such extent as he or the appropriate Military Commander may determine, from which any or all persons may be excluded...""It was Feb. 19, 1942. Japan had attacked Pearl Harbor two months earlier; For looking like the enemy, Japanese and Japanese American people in the U.S. were now considered ""enemy combatants"" and the executive order authorized the government to forcibly remove approximately 125,000 people from their homes and relocate them to prison camps around the country. Star Trek  actor George Takei has written about this time in his life before — once in an autobiography, then in a  graphic memoir,  and now in his new children's book,  My Lost Freedom. It's about the years he and his mom, dad, brother and baby sister spent in a string of prison camps: swampy Camp Rohwer in Arkansas, desolate Tule Lake in northern California. But first, they were taken from their home, driven to the Santa Anita racetrack and forced to live in horse stalls while the camps were being built. ""The horse stalls were pungent,"" Takei remembers, ""overwhelming with the stench of horse manure. The air was full of flies, buzzing. My mother, I remember, kept mumbling 'So humiliating. So humiliating.'""He says, ""Michelle's drawing really captured the degradation our family was reduced to.""  Michelle is Michelle Lee, the illustrator — and researcher — for the book. Lee relied heavily on Takei's text and his excellent memory, but it was the research that both agree really brought the art to life. ""I'm telling it from the perspective of a senior citizen,"" Takei, 87, laughs. ""I really had to wring my brains to try to remember some of the details."" So Takei took Lee to the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles, where he is a member of the board. They had lunch in Little Tokyo, got to know each other, met with the educational director, and looked at the exhibits. Then Lee started digging into the archives. ""I looked for primary sources that showed what life was like because I feel like that humanizes it a lot more,"" Lee explains. She found some color photographs taken by Bill Manbo, who had smuggled his camera into the internment camp at Heart Mountain in Wyoming. ""While I was painting the book, I tried as much to depict George and his family just going about their lives under these really difficult circumstances."" Takei says he was impressed with how Lee managed to capture his parents: his father, the reluctant leader and his mother, a fashion icon in her hats and furs. ""This has been the first time that I've had to depict real people,"" Lee adds. To get a feel for 1940s fashion, Lee says she looked at old Sears catalogues. ""What are people wearing? All the men are wearing suits. What kind of colors were clothes back then."" But a lot of information has also been lost — Lee wasn't able to see, for example, where Takei and his family lived in Arkansas because the barracks at Camp Rohwer have been torn down — there's a museum there now. ""I didn't actually come across too many photos of the interior of the barracks,"" says Lee. ""The ones I did come across were very staged."" She did, however, find the original floor plans for the barracks at Jerome Camp,  also in Arkansas. ""I actually printed the floorplan out and then built up a little model just to see what the space was actually like,"" Lee says. ""I think it just emphasized how small of a space this is that whole families were crammed into."" One illustration in the book shows the work that Takei's mother put in to make that barrack — no more than tar paper and boards stuck together — a home. ""She gathered rags and tore them up into strips and braided them into rugs so that we would be stepping on something warm,"" Takei remembers. She found army surplus fabrics and sewed curtains for the windows. She took plant branches that had fallen off the nearby trees and made decorative sculptures. She asked a friendly neighbor to build a table and chairs. ""You drew the home that my mother made out of that raw space, Takei tells Lee. ""That was wonderful."" Michelle Lee painted the art for  My Lost Freedom  using watercolor, gouache and colored pencils. Most of the illustrations have a very warm palette, but ever-present are the barbed wire fences and the guard towers. ""There's a lot of fencing and bars,"" Lee explains. ""That was kind of the motif that I was using throughout the book... A lot of vertical and horizontal patterns to kind of emphasize just how overbearing it was."" Takei says one of his favorite drawings in the book is a scene of him and his brother, Henry, playing by a culvert. ""Camp Rohwer was a strange and magical place,""  Takei writes.  ""We'd never seen trees rising out of murky waters or such colorful butterflies. Our block was surrounded by a drainage ditch, home to tiny, wiggly black fishies. I scooped them up into a jar. One morning they had funny bumps. Then they lost their tails and their legs popped out. They turned into frogs!"" ""They're just two children among many children who were imprisoned at these camps,"" says Lee, ""and to them, perhaps, aspects of being there were just fun."" The illustration depicts both childlike wonder and — still, always — a sense of foreboding. Butterflies fly around a barbed wire fence. A bright sun shines on large, dark swamp trees. Kids play in the shadow of a guard tower. ""There's so much that you tell in that one picture,"" says Takei. ""That's the art."" ""So many of your memories are of how perceptive you are to things that are going on around you,"" adds Lee, ""but also still approaching things from a child's perspective."" Even though the events in  My Lost Freedom  took place more than 80 years ago, illustrator Michelle Lee and author George Takei say the story is still very relevant today. ""These themes of displacement and uprooting of communities from one place to another — these are things that are constantly happening,"" says Lee. Because of war and because of political decisions ... those themes aren't uncommon. They're universal."" Takei agrees. ""People need to know the lessons and learn that lesson and apply it to hard times today. And we hope that a lot of people get the book and read it to their children or read it to other children and act on it."" He's done his job, he says, now the readers have their job.

"Ari Shapiro,Michael Levitt,Mallory Yu","In a small brick building in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, you can find Adam Moss's ""den of torture.""Prior to this interview, almost no one has been allowed in.""Just my husband and my teacher. That's it."" Moss said. ""Two people in my entire life and I've had this thing for five years. So welcome.""This space is less menacing than most dens of torture; there aren't any medieval instruments of pain after all. Instead, the small, light-filled room overflows with brushes and palettes, and paintings of various sizes and stages of completion rest on every surface.When Adam Moss gave up his job as editor-in-chief of  New York Magazine  five years ago, he started painting. He loved it, but it was agonizing. ""I really wanted to be good, and it made the act of making art so frustrating for me,"" said Moss. ""This [studio] is where I come many days and wrestle with trying to make something.""Trying to make something is exactly the subject of Adam Moss's new book,  The Work of Art: How Something Comes from Nothing .""The book is called  The Work of Art ,"" says Moss. ""And that is kind of what it's about.""It's about the work.The book has 43 chapters, each one dedicated to a single artist, and their process of creating a single work. They come from a wide range of disciplines. There are poets, painters, chefs, sand castle sculptors and crossword puzzle makers.And through this collection of interviews, the book tries to answer the questions: How does a sketch become a painting? How does a scribbled lyric become a song? How does an inspiration become a masterpiece?The book is a visual feast, full of drafts, sketches, and scribbled notebook pages.Every page shows how an idea becomes a finished design.In one chapter, Moss speaks with Amy Sillman, an abstract painter who Moss admires for her unique use of color and shape.""Amy was also a dream subject for this project,"" Moss writes. ""Because to reach the finish line of most of her paintings, she paints dozens of paintings, or even more, each usually pretty wonderful.""The chapter contains 39 images, demonstrating the full evolution from first draft to finished product of her work,  Miss Gleason .Each image is accompanied by a quote from Sillman, explaining what step that particular draft represented in her process.In another chapter, Moss speaks with the musician Rostam, who describes the process of writing the song ""In a River.""For Rostam, the creative process occurred in large part on his iPhone, in a collection of draft lyrics written in the notes app, and melodies in recorded as voice memos.Eventually, those notes and recording on his phone evolved into a completed song.So, what is the key to creating a masterpiece? Moss did not find an answer. All of artists featured across the book are unique, and so are their creative processes.However, Moss did point to some frequently shared traits.One commonality Moss found was that many artists describe themselves as having ADHD.""Whether they have ADHD or not, [they have] the elements that we associate with ADHD,"" Moss said, describing a balance of distractedness and focus. ""You need to be distracted enough for your mind, for your imagination to go fishing, and you need to be focused enough to know what to do with it.""Moss also found that his subjects consistently found ways not to let the fear of failure or mistakes prevent them from starting. ""They tried to get through that as quickly as possible and with as little thought as possible,"" Moss said. ""Many of them write in longhand, giving themselves explicit permission to fail.""However, there was one trait between Moss's subjects that was truly ubiquitous. ""They all have a compulsion, an obsession to make something. It gets into their system and they can't let go of it,"" Moss said, explaining that the vision or the final product is secondary to the process.""The end product is not the point,"" Moss said. ""what they were consumed by, why they did what they did is because they were consumed by the work.

None,"A salve for America's  loneliness epidemic  could exist right in front of its homes.Front yards are a staple of many American neighborhoods. Lush plantings, porches or trinkets can capture the attention of passersby and spark conversation. Other lawns say ""stay away,"" whether it's through imposing fences or foreboding signs.But what do yards tell us about the people who tend them – and how they feel about their home, neighborhood and city?In our study  of nearly 1,000 front yards in Buffalo's Elmwood Village neighborhood, we found that the livelier and more open the front yard, the more content and connected the resident.<h2>Cultivating a sense of place</h2>Our study of front yards is part of a larger investigation into the ways American neighborhoods can cultivate a stronger "" sense of place ,"" which refers to the feeling of attachment and belonging one feels to their home, neighborhood and city.For decades, psychological, geographical and design research has linked a sense of place to  happier neighborhood residents  and  stronger ties  among neighbors.We decided to focus on Buffalo's Elmwood Village for this particular study. There was the convenience factor, of course – we're both professors at the University at Buffalo. But in 2007, Elmwood Village had also been selected by the American Planning Association as one of "" 10 Great Neighborhoods in America .""We wanted to know what set Elmwood Village apart.Located north of downtown Buffalo, this leafy neighborhood is famed for  its parkways  designed by landscape architect  Frederick Law Olmsted , who also helped plan New York's  Central Park  and Boston's  Emerald Necklace . Elmwood Village is relatively affluent, yet it has a diverse mix of renters and homeowners. Elmwood Avenue is the neighborhood's commercial heart and is surrounded by a dense blend of single-family and multifamily homes.  In earlier research  we had already shown that Elmwood Village's residents have a strong sense of place. They especially appreciated the parkways and the area's large, historic homes that had been built along tree-lined streets.But we wanted to know whether residents also express their own sense of place from their homes, particularly the parts that are visible to all passersby.In the precious few feet in front of one's home, a resident can put their values and interests on display, whether it's garden gnomes,  Little Free Libraries , elaborate landscaping, sports allegiances or political loyalties.While hanging out or working from their yards, residents  can easily chat  with neighbors; one 1997 study found that  more than three out of four  new neighborhood contacts are made from the front yard.These spaces are like bridges to the rest of the neighborhood, where each resident can decide how much they want to express themselves to their neighbors and passersby. At the same time, front yards can also be used to cordon off the home, blocking views or discouraging access with fences, hedges and warnings.<h2>Life in Elmwood Village's front yards</h2>In the fall of 2022, we assigned a team of 17 undergraduate environmental design students at the University at Buffalo to observe how residents shaped 984 front yards along 25 blocks in Elmwood Village.A pilot study had demonstrated the elements they could reliably measure: flags, expressive signs, flower pots, landscaping, toys and games, seats, porches, fences and hedges, and welcoming or unwelcoming signs. We ended up not being able to reliably track lawn care or home maintenance, since each researcher had different opinions on the measures. (Unfortunately, in this particular neighborhood, garden gnomes and Little Free Libraries were too rare to include.)We then compared the data from the students' fieldwork to responses from surveys we had administered asking residents about their attachment to their homes, neighbors and neighborhood; whether they thought their surroundings had a strong identity; and if they felt connected to nature.The results proved remarkably consistent. Whether they proudly displayed Buffalo Bills flags or simply had a couple of flower pots on their front porch, residents who expressed themselves with items in front of their house reported feeling a greater sense of place.Those with obstructions in place, such as fences and hedges, correlated to a lower sense of place. Interestingly, unwelcoming signs such as ""No Trespassing"" or ""Smile, You're on Camera"" did not.Even objects as simple as toys or plastic playground gear left out in the front yard seemed to indicate a strong sense of place. To us, this says a couple of things: Homeowners trust that their property won't get stolen, and parents don't seem all too concerned about letting their kids play outside with neighborhood friends.This connects to our strongest result: Elements that facilitate socializing – a garden chair, a porch, a bench – were associated with a strong boost in residents' sense of place in every aspect we measured, whether it was their view of their home, their street or their neighborhood.<h2>Building more connected neighborhoods</h2>Our study validates urbanists'  decades-old contention  that lively front yards make for more connected neighborhoods.And it turns out that places with tiny front yards, or even none at all, can also play along.One study of Rotterdam, Netherlands , found that the port city's residents, even with little-to-no space in front of their densely built, urban homes, nonetheless embellished their sidewalks with seats, planters and knickknacks to express themselves. The research found that these small gestures were linked to stronger community ties and happier residents. This also suggests that while socioeconomic factors affect how much and what kind of spaces people have surrounding their homes, the link between lively, expressive displays and social connectedness holds up across different income groups - as long as designers let them. In our view, the results of our study should serve as a gentle reminder to architects, planners and developers that when they design homes and neighborhoods, they ought to create spaces for sharing values and conversations in front of homes. That means prioritizing porches over parking, and valuing canvases for self-expression over saving space or money. While American designers and builders are under enormous pressure to  produce more housing , they shouldn't forget that only residents can turn them into homes.People have an amazing ability to mold their surroundings to suit their needs.Elmwood Village's residents already know this, though. They're busy organizing  their next Porchfest , the annual front-yard arts and music festival that burnishes the neighborhood's  reputation as one of America's best places to live .Conrad Kickert  is an associate professor of architecture at University at BuffaloKelly Gregg  is an associate professor of urban planning at University at Buffalo.

I get chills every year at Passover, because I realized that it started in ancient Israel. I mean, it's in the Bible!""Nathan has written a dozen cookbooks, documenting how food traditions evolved as Jews wandered all over the world through the centuries. Now in her 80s, her new book is her most personal work yet, excavating her own culinary history in a combination memoir and cookbook called  My Life in Recipes .""I've been more nervous about this book than any book... It's sort of going into my life, you know?""Nathan spoke with  All Things Considered  in her Washington, D.C. kitchen on a late March day, while she prepped a version of a dish she's been eating since childhood: chicken matzo ball soup. And, like many Jewish mothers and grandmothers before her, that afternoon, she fretted over whether the matzo balls would turn out the way she wanted them to. Every family has their own recipe, whether they're light, fluffy, hard, dense.""So my mother's, hers were al dente,"" Nathan said. ""And my mother-in-law's were very light. You know, she was straight from Poland.""As with every immigration story, these family recipes evolved as people relocated, fleeing wars or seeking a better life for their kids. One example is a special combination Nathan adds to her own matzo balls.""I'd added ginger [and] nutmeg, which I knew was what my father's family would have used in Germany,"" she explained. ""Ginger nutmeg was a very common condiment combination in the 19th and early 20th century.""For Nathan, cooking matzo ball soup for Passover, or any Jewish holiday, just feels comfortable – like home.""It's the smell,"" she said. ""You just know that smell. Like my mother's brisket, I know; like challah, I know. I love those smells. It knows that you're at home, that there are people that care."" While the soup simmers, Joan walks over to the living room where boxes of letters and books are laid out. They're some of the artifacts that she's uncovered from her family, including handwritten recipe books in German. One from her great-grandmother dates back to 1927, written in purple ink full of recipes for desserts like kuchen and caramel pudding. Nathan's new book is full of her letters, diary entries and parts of these family artifacts.  This book is also a love story. Joan Nathan writes about her courtship and marriage of 45 years to her late husband, Allan Gerson. He died just before the pandemic. She says writing this book felt almost like a form of therapy.  ""It was my savior. I would just write. And I would include him in my life, you know? So it was a way of really making him part of my life. And I think it was really helpful to me. It really gave me strength."" My Life in Recipes  also includes anecdotes from Nathan's prolific career, her world travels and stories of her collaborations with food luminaries that include Julia Child.""Julia – I had her 90th birthday in this - she was sitting right here on this couch. I had a party for her. She's somebody who just kept living,"" Nathan remembered. ""And she said to me, at 90, why should I quit if I'm doing what I like to do? And she made me realize a few things: Have people that are younger around you as you get older, be positive, don't talk about being uncomfortable or whatever.

Allison Aubrey,"A drug taken by millions of people to control diabetes may do more than lower blood sugar.Research suggests  metformin  has anti-inflammatory effects that could help protect against common age-related diseases including heart disease, cancer, and cognitive decline.Scientists who study the biology of aging have designed a clinical study, known as  The TAME Trial,  to test whether metformin can help prevent these diseases and promote a longer healthspan in healthy, older adults.Michael Cantor, an attorney, and his wife  Shari Cantor , the mayor of West Hartford, Connecticut both take metformin. ""I tell all my friends about it,"" Michael Cantor says. ""We all want to live a little longer, high-quality life if we can,"" he says.Michael Cantor started on metformin about a decade ago when his weight and blood sugar were creeping up. Shari Cantor began taking metformin during the pandemic after she read that it may help  protect against  serious infections.The Cantors are in their mid-60s and both say they feel healthy and have lots of energy. Both noticed improvements in their digestive systems – feeling more ""regular"" after they started on the drug,Metformin costs  less than a dollar  a day, and depending on insurance, many people pay no out-of-pocket costs for the drug.""I don't know if metformin increases lifespan in people, but the evidence that exists suggests that it very well might,"" says  Steven Austad , a senior scientific advisor at the American Federation for Aging Research who studies the biology of aging.<h2>An old drug with surprising benefits</h2>Metformin was first used to treat diabetes in the 1950s in France. The drug is a  derivative of guanidine , a compound found in  Goat's Rue,  an herbal medicine long used in Europe.The FDA approved metformin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in the U.S. in the 1990s. Since then, researchers have documented several surprises, including a reduced risk of cancer. ""That was a bit of a shock,"" Austad says. A meta-analysis that included data from dozens of studies, found people who took metformin had a  lower risk of several types of cancers , including gastrointestinal, urologic and blood cancers.Austad also points  to a British study  that found a lower risk of dementia and mild cognitive decline among people with type 2 diabetes taking metformin. In addition, there's research pointing to improved cardiovascular outcomes in people who take metformin including a reduced risk of  cardiovascular death .As promising as this sounds, Austad says most of the evidence is observational, pointing only to an association between metformin and the reduced risk. The evidence stops short of proving cause and effect. Also, it's unknown if the benefits documented in people with diabetes will also reduce the risk of age-related diseases in healthy, older adults.""That's what we need to figure out,"" says  Steve Kritchevsky , a professor of gerontology at Wake Forest School of Medicine, who is a lead investigator for the Tame Trial.The goal is to better understand the mechanisms and pathways by which metformin works in the body. For instance, researchers are looking at how the drug may help improve energy in the cells by  stimulating autophagy,  which is the process of clearing out or recycling damaged bits inside cells.Researchers also want to know more about how metformin can help reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, which may slow biological aging.""When there's an excess of oxidative stress, it will damage the cell. And that accumulation of damage is essentially what aging is,"" Kritchevsky explains.When the forces that are damaging cells are running faster than the forces that are repairing or replacing cells, that's aging, Kritchevsky says. And it's possible that drugs like metformin could slow this process down.By targeting the biology of aging, the hope is to prevent or delay multiple diseases, says  Dr. Nir Barzilai  of Albert Einstein College of Medicine, who leads the effort to get the trial started.<h2>The ultimate in preventative medicine</h2>Back in 2015, Austad and a bunch of aging researchers began pushing for a clinical trial.""A bunch of us went to the FDA to ask them to approve a trial for metformin,' Austad recalls, and the agency was receptive. ""If you could help prevent multiple problems at the same time, like we think metformin may do, then that's almost the ultimate in preventative medicine,"" Austad says.The aim is to enroll 3,000 people between the ages of 65 and 79 for a six-year trial. But Dr. Barzilai says it's been slow going to get it funded. ""The main obstacle with funding this study is that metformin is a generic drug, so no pharmaceutical company is standing to make money,"" he says.Barzilai has turned to philanthropists and foundations, and has some pledges.  The National Institute on Aging,  part of the National Institutes of Health, set aside about $5 million for the research, but that's not enough to pay for the study which is estimated to cost between $45 and $70 million.The frustration over the lack of funding is that if the trial points to protective effects, millions of people could benefit. ""It's something that everybody will be able to afford,"" Barzilai says.Currently the FDA doesn't recognize aging as a disease to treat, but the researchers hope this would usher in a paradigm shift — from treating each age-related medical condition separately, to treating these conditions together, by targeting aging itself.For now, metformin is only approved to treat type 2 diabetes in the U.S., but doctors can prescribe it off-label for  conditions other than its approved use .Michael and Shari Cantor's doctors were comfortable prescribing it to them, given the drug's long history of safety and the possible benefits in delaying age-related disease.""I walk a lot, I hike, and at 65 I have a lot of energy,"" Michael Cantor says. I feel like the metformin helps,"" he says. He and Shari say they have not experienced any negative side effects.Research shows a small percentage of people who take metformin experience GI distress that makes the drug intolerable. And, some people develop a b12 vitamin deficiency. One  study  found people over the age of 65 who take metformin may have a harder time building new muscle.""There's some evidence that people who exercise who are on metformin have less gain in muscle mass, says  Dr. Eric Verdin , President of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging. That could be a concern for people who are  under-muscled .But Verdin says it may be possible to repurpose metformin in other ways ""There are a number of companies that are exploring metformin in combination with other drugs,"" he says. He points to research underway to combine metformin with a drug called galantamine for the  treatment of sarcopenia , which is the medical term for age-related muscle loss. Sarcopenia affects millions of older people,  especially women .The science of testing drugs to target aging is rapidly advancing, and metformin isn't the only medicine that may treat the underlying biology.""Nobody thinks this is the be all and end all of drugs that target aging,"" Austad says. He says data from the clinical trial could stimulate investment by the big pharmaceutical companies in this area. ""They may come up with much better drugs,"" he says.Michael Cantor knows there's no guarantee with metformin. ""Maybe it doesn't do what we think it does in terms of longevity, but it's certainly not going to do me any harm,"" he says.Cantor's father had his first heart attack at 51. He says he wants to do all he can to prevent disease and live a healthy life, and he thinks Metformin is one tool that may help.For now, Dr. Barzilai says the metformin clinical trial can get underway when the money comes in.This story was edited by Jane Greenhalgh",2024-04-22 12:01:00 PM EEST,NPR,A cheap drug may slow down aging.

Selena Simmons-Duffin,"In Idaho, when a pregnant patient has complications, abortion is only legal to prevent the woman's death. But a federal law known as EMTALA requires doctors to provide ""stabilizing treatment"" to patients in the emergency department.The Biden administration sees that as a direct conflict, which is why the abortion issue is back – yet again – before the Supreme Court on Wednesday. The case began just a few weeks after the justices overturned  Roe v. Wade  in 2022, when the federal Justice Department  sued Idaho , arguing that the court should declare that ""Idaho's law is invalid"" when it comes to emergency abortions because the federal emergency care law preempts the state's abortion ban. So far, a district court agreed with the Biden administration, an appeals court panel agreed with Idaho, and the Supreme Court allowed the strict ban to take effect in January when it agreed to hear the case.The case, known as  Moyle v. United States   (Mike Moyle is the speaker of the Idaho House), has major implications on everything from what emergency care is available in states with abortion bans to how hospitals operate in Idaho. Here's a summary of what's at stake.<h2>1. Idaho physicians warn patients are being harmed</h2>Under  Idaho's abortion law , the medical exception only applies when a doctor judges that ""the abortion was necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman."" (There is also an exception to the Idaho abortion ban in cases of rape or incest, only in the first trimester of the pregnancy, if the person files a police report.) In a  filing with the court , a group of 678 physicians in Idaho described cases in which women facing serious pregnancy complications were either sent home from the hospital or had to be transferred out of state for care. ""It's been just a few months now that Idaho's law has been in effect – six patients with medical emergencies have already been transferred out of state for [pregnancy] termination,"" Dr. Jim Souza, chief physician executive of St. Luke's Health System in Idaho, told reporters on a press call last week.Those delays and transfers can have consequences. For example, Dr. Emily Corrigan  described a patient  in court filings whose water broke too early, which put her at risk of infection. After two weeks of being dismissed while trying to get care, the patient went to Corrigan's hospital – by that time, she showed signs of infection and had lost so much blood she needed a transfusion. Corrigan added that without receiving an abortion, the patient could have needed a limb amputation or a hysterectomy – in other words, even if she didn't die, she could have faced life-long consequences to her health. Attorneys for Idaho defend its abortion law,  arguing that  ""every circumstance described by the administration's declarations involved life-threatening circumstances under which Idaho law would allow an abortion."" Ryan Bangert, senior attorney for the Christian legal powerhouse Alliance Defending Freedom, which is providing pro-bono assistance to the state of Idaho, says that ""Idaho law does allow for physicians to make those difficult decisions when it's necessary to perform an abortion to save the life of the mother,"" without waiting for patients to become sicker and sicker. Still, Dr. Sara Thomson, an OB-GYN in Boise, says difficult calls in the hospital are not hypothetical or even rare. ""In my group, we're seeing this happen about every month or every other month where this state law complicates our care,"" she says. Four patients have sued the state  in a separate case  arguing that the narrow medical exception harmed them.""As far as we know, we haven't had a woman die as a consequence of this law, but that is really on the top of our worry list of things that could happen because we know that if we watch as death is approaching and we don't intervene quickly enough, when we decide finally that we're going to intervene to save her life, it may be too late,"" she says. <h2>2. Hospitals are closing units and struggling to recruit doctors</h2>Labor and delivery departments are expensive for hospitals to operate. Idaho already had a shortage of providers, including OB-GYNS. Hospital administrators now say the Idaho abortion law has led to an exodus of maternal care providers from the state, which has a population of 2 million people. Three rural hospitals in Idaho have closed their labor-and-delivery units since the abortion law took effect. ""We are seeing the expansion of what's called obstetrical deserts here in Idaho,"" said Brian Whitlock, president and CEO of the Idaho Hospital Association. Since Idaho's abortion law took effect, nearly one in four OB-GYNs have left the state or retired,  according to a report  from the Idaho Physician Well-Being Action Collaborative. The report finds the loss of doctors who specialize in high-risk pregnancies is even more extreme – five of nine full time maternal-fetal medicine specialists have left Idaho. Administrators say they aren't able to recruit new providers to fill those positions. ""Since [the abortion law's] enactment, St. Luke's has had markedly fewer applicants for open physician positions, particularly in obstetrics. And several out-of-state candidates have withdrawn their applications upon learning of the challenges of practicing in Idaho, citing [the law's] enactment and fear of criminal penalties,"" reads  an amicus brief  from St. Luke's health system in support of the federal government.""Prior to the abortion decision, we  already ranked 50th  in number of physicians per capita – we were already a strained state,"" says Thomson, the doctor in Boise. She's experienced the loss of OB-GYN colleagues first hand. ""I had a partner retire right as the laws were changing and her position has remained open – unfilled now for almost two years – so my own personal group has been short-staffed,"" she says. ADF's Bangert says he's skeptical of the assertion that the abortion law is responsible for this exodus of doctors from Idaho. ""I would be very surprised if Idaho's abortion law is the sole or singular cause of any physician shortage,"" he says. ""I'm very suspicious of any claims of causality.""<h2>3. Justices could weigh in on fetal ""personhood""</h2>The state of Idaho's brief argues that EMTALA actually requires hospitals ""to protect and care for an 'unborn child,'"" an argument echoed in friend-of-the-court briefs from the  U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops  and a  group of states  from Indiana to Wyoming that also have restrictive abortion laws. They argue that abortion can't be seen as a stabilizing treatment if one patient dies as a result.Thomson is also Catholic, and she says the idea that, in an emergency, she is treating two patients – the fetus and the mother – doesn't account for clinical reality. ""Of course, as obstetricians we have a passion for caring for both the mother and the baby, but there are clinical situations where the mom's health or life is in jeopardy, and no matter what we do, the baby is going to be lost,"" she says.The Idaho abortion law uses the term ""unborn child"" as opposed to the words ""embryo"" or ""fetus"" – language that implies the fetus has the same rights as other people. Mary Ziegler , a legal historian at University of California - Davis, who is writing a book on fetal personhood, describes it as the ""North Star"" of the anti-abortion rights movement. She says this case will be the first time the Supreme Court justices will be considering a statute that uses that language.""I think we may get clues about the future of bigger conflicts about fetal personhood,"" she explains, depending on how the justices respond to this idea. ""Not just in the context of this statute or emergency medical scenarios, but in the context of the Constitution.""ADF  has dismissed  the idea that this case is an attempt to expand fetal rights. ""This case is, at root, a question about whether or not the federal government can affect a hostile takeover of the practice of medicine in all 50 states by misinterpreting a long-standing federal statute to contain a hidden nationwide abortion mandate,"" Bangert says. <h2>4. The election looms large</h2>Ziegler suspects the justices will allow Idaho's abortion law to remain as is. ""The Supreme Court has let Idaho's law go into effect, which suggests that the court is not convinced by the Biden administration's arguments, at least at this point,"" she notes.Whatever the decision, it will put abortion squarely back in the national spotlight a few months before the November election. ""It's a reminder on the political side of things, that Biden and Trump don't really control the terms of the debate on this very important issue,"" Zielger observes. ""They're going to be things put on everybody's radar by other actors, including the Supreme Court.""The justices will hear arguments in the case on Wednesday morning. A decision is expected by late June or early July.",2024-04-23 19:23:00 PM EEST,NPR,What's at stake as the Supreme Court hears Idaho case about abortion in emergencies,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/04/23/1246611400/whats-at-stake-as-the-supreme-court-hears-idaho-case-about-abortion-in-emergenci
"Pien Huang,Rhaina Cohen","The Science of Siblings  is a new series exploring the ways our siblings can influence us, from our money and our mental health all the way down to our very molecules. We'll be  sharing these stories  over the next several weeks.The first time Susan Ashbrook Harvey and Robin Darling Young traveled together in the Middle East, they got very close very quickly. It was 1985, and the two scholars were crammed into a tiny van with several others bound for Tur Abdin, a hilly region in southeast Turkey  filled with holy sites . ""We had squeezed ourselves into a dolmish — a van — that was literally full of people. If you know dolmatas [a Greek dish of rice packed tightly into grape leaves], it's the same word,"" Darling Young says. ""We rode down with everybody and her chicken.""  On paper, the two scholars had a lot in common when they met decades ago. They both studied the ancient traditions of Syriac Orthodox Christianity. Both were women in their mid-30s in a male-dominated field. But until their trip, they'd really only crossed paths at conferences.So when they decided to travel for three weeks together, to see with their own eyes the holy places they'd only read about on the page — it was a leap of faith.""Robin called me up one day and said, 'Let's go to visit the Syriac East,'"" Harvey recalls. ""It was kind of risky to do this kind of trip together, because there was no escape."" The two women dove into the adventure. They hitchhiked through the countryside and attended worship services in church communities and villages. When the day was over, they'd sleep in sparse, shared pilgrims' quarters in monasteries, where monks would sing hymns at night.That intense experience of travel and research tested them — and bonded them.Three weeks later, when they reached Jerusalem, they had become so close that Mor Dionysius Behnan Jajjawi, then the Archbishop of the Syriac Orthodox Church in Jerusalem and the Holy Land, noticed the special quality of their friendship. After welcoming them as pilgrims and guests, and giving them a personal tour of the city's Syrian churches, he observed that ""we had a friendship that was based on something deeper than blood, because our relationship was based on something bigger and greater than ourselves,"" Harvey says. When they came to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre — which many Christians consider the holiest place in the world, thought to be the site where Jesus was crucified — Archbishop Jajjawi asked: ""Would you like to come to the liturgy, after which we will perform an ancient ritual?"" Darling Young recalls.The ritual he had in mind would join these friends as sisters, in a traditional ceremony that dates back thousands of years.<h2>A practice that dates back to 4th-century monks</h2>The practice, called ""adelphopoiesis,"" means ""brother-making"" in Greek and is thought to have originated among monks, says  Claudia Rapp , a Byzantine scholar at the University of Vienna and author of the book  Brother-Making in Late Antiquity and Byzantium.""The earliest inklings we find are for these kinds of prayers to be performed between two people who are on the same spiritual journey,"" Rapp says. Historical records show that sworn brothers would then be obliged to pray for each other and would sometimes be buried in the same tomb.Evidence for this practice between monks dates back to between 4th- and 7th-century ancient Egypt, Rapp says. By the ninth century, the practice spread. ""Laypeople adopt[ed] the practice for themselves, in order to either cement friendships or to neutralize enemies — and generally to extend their families so that they can have a wider social network within which to operate,"" Rapp says.While some scholars have presented these ceremonies as early forms of same-sex romantic marriage, Rapp says the evidence does not fully support this interpretation. ""[While] some people [may] have chosen it to cement a strong emotional bond that may also have included sexual activity ... I don't think ritual brotherhood was essential for people who wanted to live in male relationships [as lovers],"" Rapp says.  She explains that adelphopoiesis is ""not a replacement for marriage. It's an additional social networking strategy.""  Versions of the practice existed in other regions too. In the Balkans, Muslims and Christians swore brotherhood so they wouldn't have to fight each other in religious conflicts. In  medieval England , men who appeared to have practiced sworn brotherhood now lie together in joint crypts. <h2>Sworn siblings in China helped each other in chaotic times</h2>In China, stories and records documenting sworn brotherhood date back to 350 B.C.E., says  Wendy Chen , a professor at Texas Tech University who has studied the practice in ancient China. One of the earliest stories centers on the deep friendship between a  government official and a woodcutter  who, despite their social class differences, bonded over a shared love of music. Perhaps the best-known story of sworn brothers in China — one that Chen herself learned growing up — comes from  Romance of the Three Kingdoms , considered one of  four great classical novels  in Chinese pre-modern literature. Set during the waning days of the Han dynasty, which  fell in 220 C.E ., three men  swear brotherhood  to each other and commit to the shared goal of protecting the empire from rebels. ""Sworn siblinghood often took place toward the end of each dynasty,"" typically a chaotic time, Chen says. ""People had to rely on each other to achieve their goals, and sometimes even for survival.""Chen says, in China, the practice is steeped in Confucian philosophy — it stresses benevolence and righteousness, promising loyalty and mutual aid between friends.<h2>An ancient ceremony, performed in modern times</h2>Robin Darling Young and Susan Harvey provided mutual support during their travels in 1985. They believe Archbishop Jajjawi noticed this. ""I think the Archbishop appreciated the ease with which we interacted and the respect with which we approached our work together as a team,"" Harvey says. That's likely why, at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, he led them away from the crowd, to a side alcove holding the tomb reputed to be the tomb of Jesus.It was a small room, ""carved straight into the living rock,"" Harvey says — lit with candles, perfumed with incense. The Archbishop wore full embroidered vestments and a long satiny stole draped around his neck. ""He took our two right hands and put them together, and then he wrapped the stole around our hands for the blessing,"" Darling Young says. The Archbishop said prayers over them. ""I don't think we actually quite knew what was going on — it was all being done in Syriac, which is another language,"" says Susan. For her part, Darling Young says the moment was overwhelming. ""At this point, it's so serious and awe-inspiring, I'm blanking out,"" she recalls. ""All I remember is 'Barekmor,' which means 'bless me, o Lord.'"" ""Barekmor"" — they repeated. ""And then he announced to us that we were now sisters forever. And so it was,"" says Darling Young.""And so it was,"" Harvey echoes. Both women say the ceremony marked a shift in their friendship. ""It was a quasi-sacrament,"" Darling Young says. ""It had the effect of gathering together the other experiences we'd had prior to it and sealing and condensing them. Our ways of thinking became connected, not just our hands."" Harvey likens the memory to ""a little treasure we carry around in our pockets."" Nearly 40 years later, they still sometimes refer to each other as ""beloved sister."" Today, while there are ceremonies marking weddings, adoptions and teenage rites of passage, there aren't really ceremonies to honor friendships, Harvey says. She sees value in restoring this lost art of brother- and sister-making. ""This is a way of really valuing [friendships], of saying: This is something truly special. That is a real gift,"" she says. ""I wish there was a way to offer something like that.""Darling Young points out that the scripts do exist in ancient texts. They're available to anyone who wants to dust them off and celebrate their best friendships.This story elaborates on a chapter from  The Other Significant Others: Reimagining Life with Friendship at the Center , a book by Rhaina Cohen that published this year.

Alejandra Borunda,"This summer, people across the U.S. will have a new way to keep track of dangerous heat headed their way through a  new heat warning system called HeatRisk . The tool, developed by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), will be used by National Weather Service offices across the country to give people an understanding of when heat goes from uncomfortable to dangerous.HeatRisk incorporates a host of factors that make  heat dangerous to human health ,  beyond just temperature . It considers elements like humidity, which reduces people's ability to cool by sweating, and whether a 90-degree day comes in April versus July — hot weather is more dangerous early in the season before people's bodies have adjusted. ""For the first time, we'll be able to know how hot is too hot for health, and not just today, but for the coming weeks,"" says Dr. Aaron Bernstein, director of the National Center for Environmental Health and a pediatrician.Hopefully, he says, the new tool will be easy to understand. It uses a color-coded scale from zero (green) to five (magenta). At zero, the heat conditions are likely not risky for most people. At 2, or yellow, risks are growing for those who are sensitive to heat—like children, or people with medical conditions that make them heat-sensitive. Four, or bright magenta, signals the heat could hurt nearly anyone. That threshold can be crossed when temperatures go above historical highs, or when extreme conditions stretch for several days in a row.The National Weather Service (NWS) will be able to issue HeatRisk warnings a full week ahead of dangerous heat. Climate change, driven primarily by human burning of fossil fuels, has increased  the intensity, duration, and danger of heat waves across North America . That extra planning time ""will be a game-changer,"" says John Balbus, director of the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity, an office within the Department of Health and Human Services. It will allow crucial extra time for cities to ramp up their emergency response plans and for individuals to think about how to protect themselves, he says.Why is a heat warning useful?When it gets hot, people end up in the emergency room—or even die. Last summer, the hottest ever recorded in many parts of the U.S., nearly 120,000 people went to the emergency room for heat-related concerns—nearly twice as many as in the previous two decades, on average. High temperatures are a major factor, but only part of the puzzle, says Ambarish Vaidyanathan, a researcher at the CDC who helped develop HeatRisk. Humidity matters too: when the air is saturated with water, people still sweat—but sweat droplets can't evaporate, so people can't cool down. Unusually high overnight temperatures prevent people from getting relief from the heat. People's past exposure to heat matters, too. The body can adjust to high heat up to a point, but that acclimatization takes time. So a 100-degree day in April poses more health risks than the same temperature in July because most people haven't had the time to adjust.Where people live, and what heat conditions they're used to, also play a role in their vulnerability to heat. ""90 degrees in Miami is not the same as 90 degrees in Portland, Maine,"" says Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the CDC.HeatRisk takes all of these factors into account. A town in Michigan, for example, might get a red, or level-3 warning, when the mercury reads 85 degrees Fahrenheit, but a town in Florida with similar conditions might only get a risk warning of yellow, or 1.Paul Charlton is an emergency medicine physician who works with rural communities in New Mexico. He thinks HeatRisk could be useful to his patients, emergency managers, and clinicians.""A lot of emergency departments would know how to care for one person that came in with heat stroke,"" he says. ""But a lot of emergency departments would not be as well prepared to take care of ten or 50 or 100 or a thousand people that might be coming in."" That could—and did—happen during really extreme heat, like the 2021 heat dome in the Pacific Northwest. Charlton says having a  better risk forecast  would give people like him invaluable time to plan and prepare for potentially catastrophic heat.Where did HeatRisk come from?Scientists at the National Weather Service and the CDC developed the tool. It was conceptualized a decade ago after some local weather bureaus in the western U.S. realized they needed a better way to warn people about upcoming heat waves. HeatRisk has been tested and refined over the years across the West since its inception in 2013. Now, school systems in California use it to decide when outdoor activities are safe. Maricopa County, which includes the Phoenix metro, has incorporated its use into its  heat management plans .NWS and CDC scientists looked at heat-related deaths around the country and analyzed the weather conditions when people died. That allowed them to find links between people's risk of dying and heat-related factors like temperature, humidity, and how long heatwaves lasted for hundreds of places across the U.S. They used those relationships to predict how different hot-weather conditions will impact people's health in different parts of the country, at different times of year.In Phoenix, a recent analysis showed that about two-thirds of heat-related deaths happened on red or purple HeatRisk days, says Michael Staudenmaier, chief of science for the NWS's Western Regional Headquarters. But more than 30% of the heat-related deaths occurred in the yellow and orange categories when heat conditions were bad but not anywhere near record-breaking extremes, he says. It shows there is a ""wide range of temperatures where heat-related impacts can occur,"" even in places well-accustomed to it. It shows that people can be vulnerable to heat illness or even death at levels much lower than they might think,  Staudenmaier says.",2024-04-23 03:10:00 AM EEST,NPR,How hot is too hot?

None,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that samples of pasteurized milk had tested positive for remnants of the bird flu virus that has  infected dairy cows .The agency stressed that the material is inactivated and that the findings ""do not represent actual virus that may be a risk to consumers."" Officials added that they're continuing to study the issue.""To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,"" the FDA said in a statement.The announcement comes nearly a month after an avian influenza virus that has sickened millions of wild and commercial birds in recent years was detected in dairy cows in at least eight states. The Agriculture Department says 33 herds have been affected to date.FDA officials didn't indicate how many samples they tested or where they were obtained. The agency has been evaluating milk during processing and from grocery stores, officials said. Results of additional tests are expected in ""the next few days to weeks.""The PCR lab test the FDA used would have detected viral genetic material even after live virus was killed by pasteurization, or heat treatment, said Lee-Ann Jaykus, an emeritus food microbiologist and virologist at North Carolina State University.""There is no evidence to date that this is infectious virus and the FDA is following up on that,"" Jaykus said.Officials with the FDA and the USDA had previously said milk from affected cattle did not enter the commercial supply. Milk from sick animals is supposed to be diverted and destroyed. Federal regulations require milk that enters interstate commerce to be pasteurized.Because the detection of the bird flu virus known as Type A H5N1 in dairy cattle is new and the situation is evolving, no studies on the effects of pasteurization on the virus have been completed, FDA officials said. But past research shows that pasteurization is ""very likely"" to inactivate heat-sensitive viruses like H5N1, the agency added.Matt Herrick, a spokesman for the International Dairy Foods Association, said that time and temperature regulations for pasteurization ensure that the commercial U.S. milk supply is safe. Remnants of the virus ""have zero impact on human health,"" he wrote in an email.Scientists confirmed the H5N1 virus in dairy cows in March after weeks of reports that cows in Texas were suffering from a mysterious malady. The cows were lethargic and saw a dramatic reduction in milk production. Although the H5N1 virus is lethal to commercial poultry, most infected cattle seem to recover within two weeks, experts said.To date, two people in U.S. have been infected with bird flu. A  Texas dairy worker  who was in close contact with an infected cow recently developed a mild eye infection and has recovered. In 2022, a prison inmate in a work program caught it while killing infected birds at a Colorado poultry farm. His only symptom was fatigue, and he recovered.The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

Nina Totenberg,"The Supreme Court hears yet another abortion case on Wednesday.  This one tests  whether a state can prevent a pregnant woman from receiving what her doctors say is essential medical treatment, including the termination of a pregnancy, if her health, but not her life, is in grave danger.In 1986, Congress passed the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or EMTALA. The law provides that hospitals receiving Medicare and Medicaid payments from the federal government--and that is most hospitals--must provide stabilizing care for any patient whose life or health is in serious jeopardy. If the hospital can't provide the care, it is required to provide safe transport to another hospital that can.That was all well and good until the Supreme Court's 2022  Dobbs  decision, which struck down  Roe v. Wade  and returned the abortion question to the states. Since then, a handful of states have adopted laws that make it illegal to provide standard emergency treatment that includes terminating a pregnancy if the woman's health, but not her life, is in imminent danger.<h2>The facts of the case</h2>Wednesday's test case comes from Idaho, where the law banning abortions is sufficiently strict that the state's leading hospital system says its patients are at risk.""There are patients who present with conditions that are very serious that could result in loss of reproductive organs, that could result in permanent disability and that could eventually become life threatening but that are not at that moment life threatening,"" says lawyer Lindsey Harrison. She represents St. Luke's Health System, Idaho's only not-for-profit community-owned and led hospital system, which operates nine emergency departments in the state.""For physicians at St. Luke's hospitals...there's a conflict between what federal law says they should do, which would allow them to save the patients organs...and what Idaho allows them to do, which is nothing, until the patient's life is at risk,"" Harrison says.The result is that patients often have to be transferred by ambulance or helicopter out of state, and arranging that takes time, especially in rough Idaho winters. ""That delay itself can cause a lot of harm to the patient,"" she adds.The state of Idaho maintains that it does, in fact, protect women, including allowing the termination of a pregnancy when medically necessary. But after the Supreme Court's 2022 abortion decision, the state enacted a law that makes it a felony for doctors to terminate a pregnancy except to save the life of the mother.<h2>The arguments</h2>John Bursch, one of the lawyers representing Idaho in the Supreme Court, blames the Biden administration for issuing new guidance on how to carry out the federal law on pregnancy-related emergencies.""What's different about EMTALA is that it's built on the Medicare Act, and the Medicare Act is built on a foundation of state law,"" Bursch asserts. ""It says hospitals must assure that their personnel meet applicable standards required by state or local laws."" He is adamant that ""EMTALA does not enforce a national standard of care.""The federal government, backed by the American College of Emergency Physicians and the American Hospital Association, counters that the whole purpose of EMTALA was to establish a national baseline for emergency care and to ensure that uninsured patients would not be turned away.""EMTALA would be meaningless if state laws could simply write exceptions to the emergency stabilization requirement,"" says Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, deputy director of the ACLU's Reproductive Freedom Project. ""That's why this argument that Idaho has the right to carve out certain conditions or treatments from EMTALA is simply incorrect.""Kolbi-Molinas maintains that the Biden administration's new guidance to hospitals after the  Dobbs  decision    is the kind of advice that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services routinely put out to remind hospitals of their obligations under the federal emergency care law.Bursch disputes that. ""EMTALA does not require any specific medical standards. It is built on this foundation of state law. And state law requires that you preserve life whenever it's possible.""He notes that EMTALA in four different places makes reference to the life of the unborn child, but if it's not possible to save both mother and child, ""then the Idaho Defense of Life act says protect the life of the mother, and it's unequivocal about that.""Short of a life-or-death situation, however, Idaho currently does not allow saving a mother's health regardless of the likelihood that the failure to act could leave the woman with lifelong health consequences. That can mean that ""If you wait too long, until a patient is on the brink of death, it may simply be too late,"" according to the ACLU's Kolbi-Molinas.The Biden administration argues that because the Idaho law only allows abortion ""to prevent the death of the pregnant woman,"" it directly conflicts with EMTALA, which allows pregnancy termination to prevent ""serious harm to the woman's health.""<h2>A conflict within the law?</h2>Under the Constitution, when there is a conflict between state and federal law, the federal law prevails over the state law.Idaho, however, contends that there is no conflict with EMTALA because the law is part of the Medicare Act, which defers to state regulation of doctors and nurses. Essentially, the state says that when the Supreme Court returned the abortion issue to the states, Idaho was free to draw the line as it has, at banning abortions except to save the life of the mother.St. Luke's, in its Supreme Court brief, says it is not always easy to draw that line, thus exposing doctors and nurses to the risk of criminal prosecution and license suspension. As a result, the hospital system says, doctors and nurses are fleeing the state, creating ob-gyn shortages that are so ""dire"" that hospitals are simply shutting down their labor and delivery services and even neo-natal intensive care programs.The prospects for that changing are not auspicious. Two lower courts initially blocked the Idaho abortion law on the ground that it conflicted with EMTALA. But in January,  the Supreme Court granted Idaho's request  and allowed the law to go into effect while the court considers the case. That action is a preliminary indication that a majority of the justices are inclined to agree with Idaho.",2024-04-24 12:00:00 PM EEST,NPR,Supreme Court to examine a federal-state conflict over emergency abortions,https://www.npr.org/2024/04/24/1244895306/supreme-court-emtala-abortions
Alejandra Borunda,"Over one-third of Americans, or about 130 million people, routinely breathe in unhealthy air, according to the newest  State of the Air report from the American Lung Association  (ALA). That number is larger in 2023 than in years past, despite significant long-term and ongoing efforts to clean the nation's air. And climate change, the report says, is making the job harder.Hotter temperatures lead to more ozone formation  and can make the air dustier, too. But the biggest climate-fueled pollution challenge  comes from wildfire smoke , which has added vast quantities of dangerous fine particle pollution to the air. Western states like California and Colorado have found that wildfire smoke is  counterbalancing long-term, successful efforts to clean up pollution from human-controlled industrial sources , like coal-fired power plants and diesel truck exhaust.""Wildfires are changing the landscape, literally and figuratively,"" says Katherine Pruitt, national policy director at the American Lung Association.<h2>Long-term air improvements interrupted in the West</h2>Since the passage of the landmark  Clean Air Act in 1970 , the country's air has improved markedly. Measures like adding pollution control to cars, trucks, and fossil-fuel-burning power plants cut down on the amount of fine particles in the air. Those particles can penetrate deep into people's lungs and even cross into the bloodstream, where they contribute to a range of chronic and acute health risks.Between 1990 and 2020, pollution from those fine particles  dropped by about 40% nationwide . The improvements were particularly noticeable in industrial East Coast cities and states.This year's State of the Air report reiterates that most of the country, most notably the eastern U.S., has gotten cleaner over time as industrial pollution sources have been reined in. But in the West, 2023 had the most days ever recorded with dangerous or very dangerous air quality, measured by the Air Quality Index. And for the first time in the report's 25-year history, the 25 cities with the worst short-term particle pollution in the country were all in the Western U.S.""The severity of the pollution is unprecedented,"" says Pruitt.The report highlights an increasingly clear challenge, says Susan Anenberg, an air quality expert at George Washington University and a consultant for the EPA. Through regulations over past decades, ""we've pretty much addressed the easiest ways of reducing pollution,"" she says. ""So we have catalytic converters on our vehicles, we have diesel particulate filters on our trucks, we have scrubbers on our power plants."" But now, Anenberg says, the challenge is getting harder as human-driven climate change worsens some problems like ozone, a gas that forms near the ground when pollutants and some natural compounds react with sunlight and heat, and wildfire smoke. The easy wins, she says, are gone. ""It just really underscores that we need to do both things at the same time,"" Anenberg says. ""We need to reduce carbon emissions that are causing anthropogenic climate change, and we need to continue to pursue stringent regulations on air pollution emissions.""<h2>A soup of unhealthy pollutants</h2>The State of the Air report tracks particle pollution and ozone. Both are harmful to people's health, increasing the risk of respiratory problems like asthma. Fine particle pollution has also been linked to worse heart disease outcomes and even the development of dementia.Bakersfield, California, has stayed at the top of the report's list for the U.S. city with the worst short-term particle pollution in the country for five years. This time, it also got top billing for year-round particle pollution, too. The region is a major site of oil and gas production as well as agriculture, both of which produce significant local pollution. ""Those industries are the main driver of our economy but also our air pollution,"" says Jasmin Martinez, an advocate at the Central Valley Air Quality Coalition who has lived most of their life in the San Joaquin Valley, where Bakersfield lies. The area has been heavily polluted for their entire lifetime, despite the federal and state laws mandating local industries to minimize pollution. They chose to move back home after college even though they were well aware of the dangers. ""It's always in the back of my mind, just living here, I may be just losing years of my life,"" Martinez says. Air pollution helps hasten t ens or even hundreds of thousands of premature deaths  each year in the U.S. alone. It is one of the most profound public health risks in the nation, says Pruitt.Bangor, Maine, and Honolulu, Hawaii, have some of the cleanest air in the country.<h2>Unequal exposure to dirty air</h2>While air in the U.S. got much cleaner overall after Clean Air Act-related regulations, the improvements were far from uniformly shared.  Communities of color and low-income Americans have historically breathed in dirtier air than wealthier or whiter communities , a disparity that continues into 2024, the report says. About 130 million Americans live in places where particle or ozone pollution exceeds levels the EPA considers healthy. About 70 million of those are people of color. Pruitt stresses people of color are ""more than twice as likely as white people to live in a place that gets failing grades"" for short and long-term particle pollution and ozone, she says.<h2>Opportunity for progress?</h2>Late last year, the Environmental Protection Agency announced a  long-awaited update to its regulatory standard for PM2.5, or fine particle pollution . The agency lowered the allowable pollution from 12 micrograms per meter cubed of air averaged over a year to 9—a major tightening, says Anenberg.The tighter standard still far exceeds the World Health Organization's recommendation of 5 micrograms or less. The American Lung Association used the new standard to calculate dangerous exposures. Applying the new value, they found the number of Americans exposed to unhealthy air rose from about 120 million people counted in the previous report to roughly 130 million. What that really means, says Pruitt, is that ""those people have been breathing unhealthy air for years."" They simply weren't counted yet.Meeting the new standard will take years to achieve, but Pruitt welcomes the rules. Next, she says, she hopes to see similar standard tightening for ozone pollution. Meanwhile, climate change complicates efforts to clean up the air, says Anenberg. ""This report tells us that we need to ramp up our carbon mitigation efforts so that we're slowing the rate of climate change because that climate change is putting more pollution into the air,"" she says. At the same time, ""we need to redouble our efforts to reduce pollution from the sources where it's possible to reduce pollution.""",2024-04-24 12:00:00 PM EEST,NPR,"130 million Americans routinely breathe unhealthy air, report finds",https://www.npr.org/2024/04/24/1246729103/unhealthy-dangerous-air-hurts-130-million-americans
Michaeleen Doucleff,"The Science of Siblings  is a new series exploring the ways our siblings can influence us, from our money and our mental health all the way down to our very molecules. We'll be  sharing these stories  over the next several weeks.Back in college, Caitlynn Almance remembers one time her little sister called her up and asked her if she could borrow a pair of boots for a high school event. But there was one big problem: Caitlynn went to college in a town two hours away from her family in Odessa, Texas. To deliver the boots, she'd have to drive two hours each way.Caitlynn didn't hesitate. ""I had only a four-hour break between classes and theater rehearsal, so I drove all the way down to Odessa, dropped off the boots at the front door and drove all the way back to school,"" Caitlynn says. ""It's because my sister needed them.To say Caitlynn cares for – and loves – her little sister would be a huge understatement. ""My sister is my best friend in the entire world, and I tell people that all the time,"" she says proudly. ""I don't think I could make it day-to-day without her.  She's the person I turn to for everything.""This genuine love and kindness doesn't stop with her sister. She feels the same about her little brother, who's also still in high school. A few years ago, she seriously considered moving in with him to Los Angeles to help support him financially during college. ""I was like, 'Look, Eddie, if that's what you really want to do, I'll pick up my life, and I'll move over there. I'll get a job to support you while you go college,' '"" she remembers. ""Because I know how hard it was for me to work and go to college at the same time. So if he doesn't have to do that, then I wouldn't want him to do that.""Caitlynn's mom, Cindy Almance, says her  four children rarely fight. ""Even at such a young age, their grandma was constantly telling them, 'You never fight,' "" she says. ""So even as teenagers, the girls didn't fight.""Over the past few decades, psychologists have begun to understand how parents, across many cultures, teach their children to build these deep, fulfilling relationships with their siblings. How parents teach their children to be kind to and care for their brothers and sisters. Psychologist  Belindo Campos  has been researching this question in families with East Asian, European and Latino heritage. ""As far as Latinos go, studies have looked at how parents intentionally teach children to focus on and prioritize family over themselves .""In fact, Campos says, scientists can actually see what parents are teaching children inside the brains of young Latinos.<h2>A revealing game about money</h2>Back in the late 2000s,  developmental psychologists  at the University of California, Los Angeles, brought into the laboratory 25 young adults from two cultural groups.  Eleven participants identified as European American and 14 participants identified as Latino. Their average age was about 20 years old. The scientists had the volunteers play a game: The young adults had to decide whether or not to help a family member who needed money. In the game, They also received money themselves. During these transactions, the scientists analyzed the participants' brains.Both Latino and European American participants equally assisted their family members who needed help. But what happened inside the reward center of their brains – which helps us feel pleasure and joy – was quite different.  The reward center of the European Americans' brains lit up much more when they received money themselves compared to when they gave money to their family members. But the reverse occurred in the brains of Latino participants: Their reward centers lit up more when they  gave  money to their family compared to when they received money.  ""So the Latino participants weren't only assisting their family members, but they were also finding it pleasurable and rewarding,"" Campos says. ""I think those findings make such a compelling argument that some of us find the act of giving to others really rewarding because we've been socialized to.""This study was small, but many other studies since then back up this key finding, Campos says. For example, researchers at the University of California, Riverside, have  found , repeatedly, that people feel better when they do something kind for another person versus doing something kind for themselves.  ""When we place our focus on others, it seems to generate its own momentary joys,"" Campos says, ""but it also seems to deflect from whatever may be bringing us down.""In other words, to raise children who care deeply about their siblings, many parents teach children not only  how  to be kind to their family but also to  want  to be kind. They teach that caring is a major source of joy. So helping your little sister or brother isn't this burden or obligation. Rather it's a part of your life that makes you feel good. ""It's about enjoyment and relations that provide happiness,"" says behavioral economist  Mariano Rojas  at the Mexico's Technological Institute. ""It gives children what I call relational wealth.""And this relational wealth, Rojas as found, has massive repercussions for Latino communities across North and South America. For the past decade, Rojas has been trying to figure out why people in Latin America countries score so high on surveys about happiness and life satisfaction. ""If you go to the World Values Survey, which has like 170 countries, you will find that Latin American countries, on average, are the happiest ones in the world,"" he says. This fact surprises many scientists, Rojas says, because Latin American countries, on average, are much poorer and have more inequality and violence than European countries. ""Latin Americans are very happy, and it's really not something you'd expect given their economic situation.""His research suggests that this happiness comes from Latino's relational wealth. ""It's not because relationships give people social or economic support,"" he explains. ""That's a mistake many psychologists make while talking about relationships and happiness. What's key is enjoying your family."" <h2>Calling every day</h2>The sun has just set over the dry, West Texas prairie. It's around dinnertime on a warm Saturday evening. Inside a little ranch house, the Almance family is doing what they do almost every day. They're gathered around the kitchen island telling stories. There's Caitlynn's grandmother, her parents, an aunt and an uncle.  Caitlynn's  mom, Cindy, tells a story about traveling with her mother-in-law right after marrying Almance's dad. As she tells the punchline, the whole crowd erupts in loud laughter.  Then I ask Cindy the same question I posed to scientists: How do you teach children to find joy in helping their siblings?And she answers exactly the same as the scientists answered: ""We model it."" Cindy says.Cindy models not just helping her siblings, but also the joy she receives from the relationships she has with her brothers and sisters. ""It's a close, close bond,"" she says. Even after some of her siblings left Odessa, Cindy still loves to talk to them on the phone. ""Every single day, at 6:30 in the morning, on my way to work. I'm already talking to them.""And Caitylnn not only  notices  these calls, she  joins  them. ""My mom's older sister and her family live in a different time zone than we do, so they have to wake up an hour earlier than their day would start, just so we could have that daily dose [of sibling love] before we get to work.""  Caitlynn's grandmother, Dora, says this modeling dates back at least seven generations. So it's a value transmitted and strengthened over time. ""The older generations taught us that helping each other keeps the family together,"" Dora adds. ""It's a chain reaction,"" Cindy adds. ""It keeps going from one generation to the next.""And what happens if a sibling doesn't pull their weight or doesn't want to keep up the family tradition of joyful helping? The family tries to pull them into the fold, says Caitlynn's aunt, Lisset Almance. ""We never put people down,"" she says. ""If that person's down, we try to cheer him up. We'll say, 'Hey, what's wrong? Don't know how much the family loves you?'""Perhaps most important, Caitlynn says, is that her family enjoys being together. Almost every day, multiple generations of brothers and sisters come together. ""This is like your everyday people,"" Caitlynn says. ""And they have such an everyday impact on my life. We don't search each other up on Facebook because we know each other well.""And now, Caitlynn is going to add the next generation of siblings. She's expecting her first child this summer. And she's already talking about having a second baby. ""This one isn't even out yet, but I'm like let's hurry up and make another one,"" she exclaims .Why? Because she wants her baby to have a sibling right away. ""The bond I have with my siblings – and the bond my siblings have with each other – it's just the most beautiful bond ever. I just can't imagine my child growing up without that.""<h2>Your turn: Tell us about your relationship with a sibling</h2>Do you have a close relationship with a sibling or siblings?

None,"The Biden administration finalized nursing home staffing rules Monday that will require thousands of them to hire more nurses and aides — while giving them years to do so.The  new rules  from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services are the most substantial changes to federal oversight of the nation's roughly 15,000 nursing homes in more than three decades. But they are less stringent than what patient advocates said was needed to provide high-quality care.Spurred by disproportionate deaths from COVID-19 in long-term care facilities, the rules aim to address perennially sparse staffing that can be a root cause of missed diagnoses, severe bedsores, and frequent falls.""For residents, this will mean more staff, which means fewer ER visits potentially, more independence,"" Vice President Kamala Harris said while meeting with nursing home workers in La Crosse, Wisconsin. ""For families, it's going to mean peace of mind in terms of your loved one being taken care of.""When the regulations are fully enacted, 4 in 5 homes will need to augment their payrolls, CMS estimated. But the new standards are likely to require slight if any improvements for many of the 1.2 million residents in facilities that are already quite close to or meet the minimum levels.<h2>'Established a floor'</h2>""Historically, this is a big deal, and we're glad we have now established a floor,"" Blanca Castro, California's long-term care ombudsman, said in an interview. ""From here we can go upward, recognizing there will be a lot of complaints about where we are going to get more people to fill these positions.""The rules primarily address staffing levels for three types of nursing home workers. Registered nurses, or RNs, are the most skilled and responsible for guiding overall care and setting treatment plans. Licensed practical nurses, sometimes called licensed vocational nurses, work under the direction of RNs and perform routine medical care such as taking vital signs. Certified nursing assistants are supposed to be the most plentiful and help residents with daily activities like going to the bathroom, getting dressed, and eating.While the industry  has increased wages by 27%  since February 2020, homes say they are still struggling to compete against better-paying work for nurses at hospitals and at retail shops and restaurants for aides. On average, nursing home RNs  earn $40  an hour, licensed practical nurses make $31 an hour, and nursing assistants are paid $19 an hour, according to the  most recent data  from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.CMS estimated the rules will ultimately cost $6 billion annually, but the plan omits any more payments from Medicare or Medicaid, the public insurers that cover most residents' stays — meaning additional wages would have to come out of owners' pockets or existing facility budgets.<h2>'Unfunded mandate'</h2>The American Health Care Association, which represents the nursing home industry, called the regulation ""an unreasonable standard"" that ""creates an impossible task for providers"" amid a persistent worker shortage nationwide.""This unfunded mandate doesn't magically solve the nursing crisis,"" the association's CEO, Mark Parkinson, said in a statement. Parkinson said the industry will keep pressing Congress to overturn the regulation.Richard Mollot, executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition, a New York City-based advocacy nonprofit, said ""it is hard to call this a win for nursing home residents and families"" given that the minimum levels were below what studies have found to be ideal.The plan was welcomed by labor unions that represent nurses — and whom President Joe Biden is counting on for support in his reelection campaign. Service Employees International Union President Mary Kay Henry called it a ""long-overdue sea change."" This political bond was underscored by the administration's decision to have Harris announce the rule with SEIU members in Wisconsin, a swing state.The new rules supplant the vague federal mandate that has been in place since the 1980s requiring nursing homes to have ""sufficient"" staffing to meet residents' needs. In practice, inspectors rarely categorized inadequate staffing as a serious infraction resulting in possible penalties, federal records show.Starting in two years, most homes must provide an average of at least 3.48 hours of daily care per resident. About 6 in 10 nursing homes are already operating at that level, a  KFF analysis found .CMS also mandated that within two years an RN must be on duty at all times in case of a patient crisis on weekends or overnight. Currently, CMS requires at least eight consecutive hours of RN presence each day and a licensed nurse of any level on duty around the clock. An inspector general report  found that nearly a thousand  nursing homes didn't meet those basic requirements.The rules give homes breathing room before they must comply with more specific requirements. Within three years, most nursing homes will need to provide daily RN care of at least 0.55 hours per resident and 2.45 hours from aides.Nursing homes in rural areas will have longer to staff up. Within three years, they must meet the overall staffing numbers and the round-the-clock RN requirement. CMS' rule said rural homes have four years to achieve the RN and nurse aide thresholds, although there was some confusion within CMS, as its press materials said rural homes would have five years.Under the new rules, the average nursing home, which has around 100 residents, would need to have at least two RNs working each day, and at least 10 or 11 nurse aides, the administration said. Homes could meet the overall requirements through two more workers, who could be RNs, vocational nurses, or aides.Homes can get a hardship exemption from the minimums if they are in regions with low populations of nurses or aides and demonstrate good-faith efforts to recruit.Democrats praised the rules, though some said the administration did not go nearly far enough. Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), the ranking member of the House Ways and Means Health Subcommittee, said the changes were ""modest improvements"" but that ""much more is needed to ensure sufficient care and resident safety."" A Republican senator from Nebraska, Deb Fischer, said the rule would ""devastate nursing homes across the country and worsen the staffing shortages we are already facing.""Advocates for nursing home residents have been pressing CMS for years to adopt a higher standard than what it ultimately settled on. A CMS-commissioned  study in 2001 found  that the quality of care improved with increases of staff up to a level of 4.1 hours per resident per day — nearly a fifth higher than what CMS will require. The consultants CMS hired in preparing its new rules  did not incorporate  the earlier findings in their evaluation of options.<h2>Threats of closure, siphoned profits</h2>CMS said the levels it endorsed were more financially feasible for homes, but that assertion didn't quiet the ongoing battle about how many people are willing to work in homes at current wages and how financially strained homes owners actually are.""If states do not increase Medicaid payments to nursing homes, facilities are going to close,"" said John Bowblis, an economics professor and research fellow with the Scripps Gerontology Center at Miami University. ""There aren't enough workers and there are shortages everywhere. When you have a 3% to 4% unemployment rate, where are you going to get people to work in nursing homes?""Researchers, however, have been skeptical that all nursing homes are as broke as the industry claims or as their books show. A  study published in March  by the National Bureau of Economic Research estimated that 63% of profits were secretly siphoned to owners through inflated rents and other fees paid to other companies owned by the nursing homes' investors.Charlene Harrington, a professor emeritus at the nursing school of the University of California-San Francisco, said: ""In their unchecked quest for profits, the nursing home industry has created its own problems by not paying adequate wages and benefits and setting heavy nursing workloads that cause neglect and harm to residents and create an unsatisfactory and stressful work environment.""KFF Health News  is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF—an independent source of health policy research, polling, and journalism.

"Marc Silver,Pierre Kattar","In Jewish homes around the world, as the sun sets on Monday night, the Passover Seder begins. This ritual marks the ancient Jewish exodus from Egypt, leaving behind a life of slavery and heading toward a new beginning.The most well-known symbol of the holiday is an unleavened baked good known as matzo. It's made of only flour and water. It's as flat as a sheet of cardboard. And it's a reminder of how those Jews fled so abruptly that they did not have time to let their bread rise.In Jewish tradition, matzo is called ""the bread of affliction"" — of suffering — and also the bread of freedom. Those are two main themes of the story of Passover ... fleeing oppression and finding liberation.Indeed, in many religions, bread is a symbolic food. It represents abundance and plenty as well as the imperative of sharing food with those in need.The Christian Bible, for example, tells of a boy who came to Jesus with just five small loaves of bread and two small fish, which Jesus used to feed over 5,000 people.""Let all who are hungry, come and eat"" is a line in the Passover Haggadah, the book that is read at the Seder before the holiday meal.That's a timely commandment.  According to the World Food Programme , ""an estimated 42.3 million people across 45 countries will be in emergency or worse levels of acute food insecurity in 2024."" Climate change is a leading cause, says the U.N. agency, but the main reason for record levels of hunger is conflict.""The idea that someone doesn't have enough to eat because they're in a war zone is intolerable,"" says  Rabbi Steven Exler  of the modern Orthodox Bayit-Hebrew Institute of Riverdale, New York. ""Human starvation has no sides. In Jewish ethics of war, no non-combatant should not have enough to eat.""The lack of bread in so many crisis spots today is a sign that hunger — and even famine — may loom.And when bread is available, even in times of suffering, it can provide comfort, a taste of the way life was before the crisis and perhaps a promise of a better future.<h2>In Israel: the symbolism of a broken matzo</h2>At the start of the Passover Seder, a piece of matzo is broken in two. In the most traditional of homes, this matzo is round.It's an act that has many interpretations.""The idea of taking something that's a perfect round and breaking it in front of everyone,"" says  Rabbi Craig Axler , who leads the Reform congregation Temple Isaiah in Fulton, Maryland, is a reminder that ""we are still living in a world of brokenness and this is the bread of affliction.""""That's a symbol of our broken world,"" agrees Udi Goren, a Jewish Israeli who works as a photographer and tour guide. His cousin was killed on Oct. 7 during the Hamas invasion of Israel and the body has not been recovered.During that attack Hamas killed over 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages to Gaza, according to the Israeli government.""My daily life in the past six months has been about grief and despair. A catastrophe of colossal magnitude,"" says Goren. He has bread to eat but his spirit, he says, is broken.He is one of many Israelis who are mourning their dead and fearing for the lives of the remaining hostages.The hostage diet was meager, according to accounts from freed hostages. Sharon Alony-Cunio and her 3-year-old twin daughters were released on November 27; her husband is still a hostage.In an interview with the Associated Press, she says that their rations included ""dry pita"" and ""sometimes moldy pita."" She added: ""A lot of the times, the girls were just crying, saying 'I'm hungry.' ""In a March 27 interview with NPR, Luis Har, who was held hostage in Gaza for 129 days before being freed by an Israeli raid, recalled, ""There was one [guard] who made sure ... that we would have provisions for food... Usually it was canned meat, 'luft' mostly. Do you know what luft is? It's a kind of canned meat. Which was usually pretty disgusting. It's not ... particularly tasty. Sometimes peas, sometimes corn. What we did get almost every day was a pita. One pita for each person.""<h2>In Gaza: the loss of bread, the return of a bakery</h2>After the Oct. 7 invasion, Israel responded with an assault on Gaza; the death toll has been over 30,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and the prospect of famine looms according to the United Nations.In Gaza, when the war began, at first there was bread.And then some months later, there was more than just bread. NPR reported in early March that, in spite of the war, a baker in the city of Rafah decided to make cakes so people in Gaza could still celebrate life — for a family whose child who wanted a sweet treat, for a couple getting married.""We Gazans love life. People are pushing themselves to hope because there are no other options,"" said baker Abu Hani, who used solar panels for refrigeration and flour from the black market.His unlikely dream of making cakes during war was short-lived. As NPR reported: ""On March 10, one day after this story was published, residents of Khan Younis  discovered extensive destruction  to Batool Cake's main branch in that city, which stored supplies and equipment for the bakery's other branches.""As the Israeli bombardment continued, as people were displaced and supplies of flour were exhausted and aid deliveries were delayed, it became a daunting task just to obtain a loaf of bread or to make one at home.Some people baked bread using animal feed.Majed Al-Shorbaji ate this bread for months. Born in Gaza, he had been living as a refugee in Italy since 2019 but returned to Gaza in September 2023, to visit his father, who had a heart attack. Al-Shorbaji was unable to leave after the war broke out.He says he ate bread made from animal feed for months. ""I ate this bread so many times. At least 20 to 30 times. It tastes like dirt, like wood. It's really bad but there's no other solution,' he says.In early April, Al-Shorbaji was in southern Gaza. He had fled from the north in hopes of finding a way out. He says he left ten family members behind; his parents, three sisters, two brothers, his brother's wife and their child. He says he repeatedly asked the Italian consulate to get him and his family out of Gaza but that they denied his request each time. He's now trying to raise money using GoFundMe to get his family out of Gaza.He says, ""It's been very long since we have eaten bread.""There is, however, a glimmer of hope in Gaza. In Rafah this past week, long lines of people waited for bread baked by a bakery that reopened with the help of the World Food Programme, after being closed for six months.Interviewed on video by Reuters , a young father who was able to obtain a bag of bread said, ""Our feeling after bread became available: It brought some sense of relief to be able to feed these children, fill the hunger and be able to move on to the next day and maybe God willing bring more.""<h2>Generous bakers in Ukraine</h2>In the small town of Kurakhove, Ukraine, just over 10 miles from the front line, the Yershov family turned an abandoned kindergarten building into a community bakery that hands out bread for free.Due to constant shelling, the windows of the building are boarded up with plywood and the ceiling has partially collapsed. ""It makes no sense to make repairs here, but it makes sense to make bread,"" says Ihor Yershov, an evangelical pastor.Together with his wife Yevheniia Yershova, he has been running the bakery since 2019. Originally, it was located near Mariinka, a town in eastern Ukraine that has been destroyed by the Russians. In April 2022, after the start of the full-scale invasion, when the city lost electricity and five shells hit the premises, the Yershovs moved most of their equipment to Kurakhove.However, even here, the 25 bakery workers are not safe — sometimes they have to hide among bags of flour during shelling to keep out shrapnel.But they will not give up their baking. ""We have no other choice,"" says Yevheniia Yershova (the spelling of her last name reflects the female gender).""Bread means life,"" adds her husband.With the financial help of their church, charities and local authorities, the Yershovs bake about 1,000 loaves of bread a day and deliver them to 10 settlements, some of which are about half a mile from the front line. The roads there have been destroyed by shells, there has been no electricity or water supply for two years, and, of course, there are no stores anymore.When money runs short, the family chips in.Yershov says the people who stay have no way to cook food from the humanitarian aid packages, so fresh bread is especially important to them. ""When we would drive into villages with freshly baked bread, people would smell it and cry,"" Yershova recalls.Among the several types of baked goods, there is a special one, as the Yershovs call it ""legendary"" – homemade bread where the dough is first mixed in a machine but then shaped made by hand.""Bread is a piece of love that you can pass from hand to hand. Bread brings warmth and home comfort,"" adds Yershov, noting that in addition to the symbols this bread carries, it also adds purpose in life and is a lifeline for the bakery's employees, who work and receive their salaries in a place where there is almost nothing left for them.""Now there is fighting, and it's not that far to Kurakhove,"" says Yershova. ""We are already thinking again about where to evacuate the bakery.""<h2>Begging for bread in Afghanistan</h2>One morning this past week, Baas Bibi was huddled outside a bakery in a relatively upscale area of west Kabul, begging for bread. She was wrapped in a large, tattered scarf and wearing plastic shoes. The Taliban have cracked down on public begging, leaving women like Bibi in a desperate game of cat-and-mouse to try to get bread.""My name is Baas Bibi, I'm 60 years old and a widow,"" she says. ""My husband died maybe 10 or 12 years ago. I have six daughters and a son and his wife who lives with me, and their children. I have another two sons who live with their wives.""Nobody in my family works except me. Look at my hands: they're swollen. My son who lives with me is a drug addict. He even sells his clothes, our kitchen utensils, for drugs."" She says she earns money by cleaning houses and making pillows and cushions to sell.Baas Bibi is among the millions of Afghans who face a lack of food, according to the United Nations.  The U.N. has struggled to raise the money it needs to care for Afghans.  And getting food to those in need is a challenge as aid groups have sometimes pulled out of the country, say  charity workers interviewed by NPR . They claim that the Taliban have tried to dictate the terms of their aid distribution.""I stand here [in front of the bakery] all day,"" says Baas Bibi. ""I'm scared of the Taliban. I'm scared they'll detain me. So far, thank God that hasn't happened. The Taliban haven't helped us so far, even though they say they do.""""In Ramadan [the Muslim holy month] I was hiding behind this tree. When people were distributing bread, I was asking them from there [behind the tree] to give me some.""During Ramadan, my stomach didn't even meet a potato. I just had water and dry bread. Sometimes, people give me some leftover food.""On Eid [the Muslim holiday following Ramadan], we had nothing to eat. Other people were wearing new clothes and they were happy. I went to the mosque and begged people for money. I collected 170 Afghanis [$2.30] and I came here and bought ten pieces of bread. I bought some potatoes and some oil.""Last night, we slept hungry, me and the kids. I tell the children, wait, wait, I've asked our neighbors for some food, just wait. And then they fall asleep.""This morning, I went to my sister's house. I told her that I'm vomiting, my ears are buzzing, I think my blood pressure is low, please give me some bread. She gave me some dry bread. I ate it quickly with water. It made my tooth bleed.""I'm wondering if a day will come, by God, that I'll have my own bread, for me and my kids. We make bread over wood fire.""<h2>The 108 bakeries of Darfur bake bread during war</h2>In a way, bread was a catalyst for the  civil war in Sudan , which is being described as the world's greatest humanitarian crisis.In late 2018 and 2019, prices for bread and fuel were skyrocketing. Public protests began. An alliance of two military forces ousted the country's dictator but then did not deliver on a promise to institute democracy.Civil war began on April 15, 2023, between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the rebel paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.NPR has reported that ""nearly 18 million across the country are facing acute levels of hunger. The coming lean season in May, could bring 'unprecedented levels of starvation,'  according to Eddie Rowe , the World Food Programme's Sudan director.""In the region of Darfur, bread is a popular food — a puffy, pitalike bread. It's used to scoop up fava bean dip, tomatoes, meat and cheese at breakfast and other meals. ""It's really delicious and you can tear it apart so easily,"" says Leni Kinzli, head of communications for the World Food Programme Sudan. ""You take the bread, dip it in everything.""But the price of bread is high. And people in Darfur are running out of money — government employees are no longer being paid, farmers may have lost their land due the conflict, traders may have limited items to hawk. People are selling off their belongings to buy food, says Duncan Riddell, a humanitarian manager with the Norwegian Refugee Council, a nongovernmental organization that has been awarded the prestigious Nansen Refugee Award for its work to help the displaced.This year, the council has launched what they're calling a ""Bread Support Program"" — providing financial aid to 108 bakeries in El Geneina, the capital of West Darfur State, so they can cut the price of bread in half.With the subsidies, ten small round loaves would cost the equivalent of about $1, according to Riddell. So a family may be able to afford bread for two meals a day instead of one, or every day instead of every couple of days, he says.The World Food Programme is a supporter of programs that focus on local food production.""Obviously bread is a lifeline for people,"" says Kinzli of the World Food Programme, who notes that much of the flour imported to Sudan comes from another war zone — Ukraine.""Any activity that can help the Sudanese people get access to food would be a good thing,"" says Alonya Synenko, a regional spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross.Local radio interviewed Abdel Hafeez Mohammed Abdallah Hamed, head of the bakers' union in the state, who said, ""I visited the bakeries on Thursday and encountered a student who wanted to buy a loaf of bread for one hundred pounds, but she was given two loaves of bread. Overwhelmed with joy, she couldn't contain her emotions and ululated"" – a high-pitched trill used to express sorrow but also joy.<h2>The wonder of bread</h2>Of course, bread is not just a symbol, a reminder.It is a food that many people love. A comfort food for sure. And on Passover, when bread is literally off the table for eight days, those who observe the ""no bread"" tradition eagerly await a taste of challah, of injera, of naan, of baguette when the holiday ends.And yes, nutritionists will note that bread in and of itself, without fortified flour or whole grains, is not exactly a nutritional paragon.But it has other virtues.""As an avid bread baker,"" says Rabbi Axler, ""I can say that the smell of fresh bread, the chew of sinking your teeth into that – there is a tremendous amount of pleasure and satisfaction.""Hanna Palamarenko, a producer in NPR's Ukraine bureau, reported from Ukraine.

"Rose Conlon,Drew Hawkins","From Nebraska to North Carolina, states with Republican-led legislatures have slowly moved  toward expanding access to Medicaid  for thousands of their residents. But some are still holding out.Medicaid provides health care to some 80 million Americans  living on low-incomes. But millions more fall into the so-called ""coverage gap"" where they make too much money for Medicaid but not enough to get their own insurance.With Medicaid expansion, states and the federal government can cover those making up to 138 percent of the poverty level - about $20,000 a year for an individual. The federal government pays for most of it through the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Democratic-led states were quick to jump in since it became available in 2014 but Republican-led states were not. More recently  red states have joined in . But 10 still have not - mostly states where voters cannot put the issue on the ballot to decide themselves. The Mississippi Legislature is considering it now.  Here's a look at two states where Medicaid expansion faces stiff opposition: Alabama and Kansas. <h2>In Kansas, the Democratic governor tries again for Medicaid expansion</h2>It's Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly's sixth year campaigning for Medicaid expansion and facing Republican opposition. Now she's appealing directly to voters.""If we do not get Medicaid expanded this session,"" she recently told reporters, ""then I would hope that they make it the number one issue going into the November 2024 election and that they hold their representatives accountable.""Her office says the proposal would enable an  estimated 150,000  more Kansans to enroll in the health care program.That includes people like Marcillene Dover, a high school physics teacher from Wichita who was driven into advocacy by her own experience back in college. She had aged out of her childhood Medicaid and was among adult Kansans who have trouble qualifying again without the expansion.""I was about a month or two into classes,"" she said. ""And I started having weird symptoms like numbness, tingling in my legs.""She said that after two years of symptoms, a nonprofit paid for an MRI that showed she had multiple sclerosis. Now 30 years old, Dover said she might not be using a wheelchair today if the illness had been caught sooner.""Having no ability to get diagnosis or get treatment meant having more physical disability that is permanent, that cannot be treated, that there is no cure for,"" she recently told lawmakers.Despite polls  finding  a majority of Kansans support Medicaid expansion, Republicans who control the legislature have blocked it. ""(The governor) truly believes that the government should take care of everybody,"" House Speaker Dan Hawkins said in an interview at the state capitol in Topeka. ""I don't. I believe we all have an individual responsibility.""He says Medicaid expansion is too expensive and would give some people ""no reason to work."" Nearly 60% of those who'd be covered under Kelly's proposal do work at least 20 hours per week, according to an analysis by the Kansas Health Institute, which seeks to increase health options for Kansans.To attract Republican support, Kelly has now included a work requirement. But Hawkins thinks it's still too weak. A handful of Republicans do support Medicaid expansion, including Rep. Jesse Borjon, who thinks the policy is pro-family and pro-business. ""One of the No. 1 issues that I hear from my constituents is on Medicaid expansion,"" the Topeka Republican said, ""And they can't understand why the legislature can't get it done.""With urging from Borjon and others, the House health committee recently held a hearing on the governor's proposal for the first time in years. But a day later, the heavily Republican committee defeated it in a voice vote.While lawmakers still have the ability to push the legislation through this year, analysts say it's unlikely.<h2>Alabama rural health centers are shutting - and Medicaid expansion gets a glance</h2>Every day, Dr. Brittney Anderson has to turn away new patients at her small, rural clinic in Demopolis, Alabama. ""It's heartbreaking sometimes,"" she said. ""I'm only one person. I can't squeeze more hours into the day.""Anderson treats about 1,700 people in her solo private practice. She said rural doctors are facing a crisis in the state because of uninsured and under-insured patients. But if Alabama adopted Medicaid expansion at least 174,000 more people would be covered,  according to KFF , the health policy research group.An attempt to tackle the problem this year was buried deep within a bill about a very different subject. A casino gambling bill contained a provision allowing gaming profits to go to rural hospitals, which some advocates hoped would be a form of Medicaid expansion. But the casino proposal was gutted and the rural clinic funding went with it.Medicaid expansion opponents say it's federal overreach. ""You're giving up a lot of your sovereignty as a state to set health policy,"" said Justin Bogie, senior director of fiscal policy at the  Alabama Policy Institute , a research group that says it's committed to limited government. ""If you open up this federal subsidized program for hundreds of thousands of people, then it could actually hurt that labor participation rate, give them another reason not to go to work, to stay at home,"" Bogie said.Research and supporters of Medicaid expansion say many in the coverage gap — more than 40% — do work, they just don't have insurance.Bogie and groups like the Alabama Hospital Association say they want to close the coverage gap through a  state-run plan  that would use federal dollars to subsidize private health care. But that hasn't been put in place yet.Federal Medicaid expansion is also a non-starter in the Republican-dominated state legislature because of its connection to Obamacare.""Just the partisan nature of this is definitely a problem,"" said Regina Wagner, professor of political science at the University of Alabama. Wagner said that for years Republican legislators in the south promised to repeal Obamacare. But other red states have adopted the program under public pressure.""A lot of rural voters are Republicans. And so your own constituents are being hit by this and you're not addressing it,"" Wagner said. ""If the pressure gets high enough and and sentiment shifts, maybe that's going to be enough to push them.""Rose Conlon covers health care for KMUW and the Kansas News Service.

None,"Voters in Alabama's  new congressional distric t chose their party's nominees Tuesday in a race that could ultimately tip the balance of power in the U.S. House of Representatives.Shomari Figures, former deputy chief of staff for Attorney General Merrick Garland defeated Alabama House Minority Leader Anthony Daniels in the Democratic primary, according to a race call by The Associated Press.Figures thanked his supporters at a speech on Tuesday night and said that he would employ ""old school"" campaigning techniques like knocking on doors between now and November in order to gain support. ""I'm enormously grateful for the confidence and the trust and the faith that the voters of this newly drawn District 2 have placed in me to represent the Democratic party in November,"" Figures said. ""That is something that I do not take lightly, something that I will take with me every single day to make sure that we're giving everybody in this district a seat at the table, a voice in the conversation."" In the Republican primary, Montgomery attorney Caroleene Dobson emerged as the winner in the race against former Alabama state Sen. Dick Brewbaker, also according to a call by The Associated Press.  Dobson reached out to rural voters in the district saying she understood their concerns growing up on a cattle farm that her family has lived on for five generations. ""Making it as a farmer isn't easy,"" she said in a r ecent campaign ad . ""It takes faith, grit and sacrifice, especially now in Joe Biden's America.""In the ad she attacked the president's immigration policies and blamed him for ""skyrocketing"" prices. Tuesday's runoffs came after no candidate in either party, Democratic or Republican, was able to secure enough votes on Super Tuesday to avoid a runoff. <h2>A district drawn to boost Black representation</h2>The newly drawn district lines came following a legal battle that reached the U.S. Supreme Court. Advocates for Black voters in Alabama claimed the state's previous congressional map, approved by a Republican-dominated state legislature, violated the Voting Rights Act. As NPR's legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg  explained  at the time of the high court ruling last year: <h2>""This is a community""</h2>Some voters, like Lisa Williams, who lives in Mobile, Ala., hopes the candidate who ultimately wins in November can put politics aside and do what's best for the district. ""It's an opportunity for whichever candidate to truly be a voice, to truly give a voice to a lot of these communities, Black or white, it doesn't matter. It's not a race thing,"" Williams said. ""This is a people thing. This is a community.""Figures and Dobson now have about seven months to make their case to voters in a district that stretches from the state capital in Montgomery down to Mobile in the southwestern corner of the state and touches the state's border with Georgia. The new district is part urban, part rural, and  has a Black voting-age  population of nearly 50%. Figures, who was one of two candidates on his party's primary ballot, benefited from name recognition in much of the district, given he's from Mobile and his parents Michael and Vivian Figures served in the state Senate. Figures also worked for Attorney General Merrick Garland and in former President Barack Obama's administration.Daniels, his primary challenger, was hoping his advocacy for tax breaks on overtime pay and his time navigating a Republican supermajority in Montgomery will appeal to voters. Dobson, a political newcomer, set her sights on the district's rural voters saying, if elected, she would push for reduced federal regulation in the agricultural section. While she campaigned on tightening U.S. border policies, she also said she supports streamlining the farm worker-visa process.Brewbaker had hoped his time as a former state senator would help him gain more votes than Dobson. On the campaign trail, Brewbaker promoted a conservative agenda, calling for tougher border policies and advocated for curbing federal spending.",2024-04-17 06:40:00 AM EEST,NPR,"Figures, Dobson advance in Alabama's runoffs for new House district",https://www.npr.org/2024/04/16/1244985601/voters-alabama-new-congress-primary-runoffs
Elena Moore,"Four years ago this week, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders ended his second bid for the White House, effectively cementing Joe Biden's path to the Democratic presidential nomination.Sanders  threw his support behind Biden . And unlike  past displays  of  party unity  after a primary fight, Biden and Sanders took a unique step to collaborate on a handful of policy-focused task forces in the hope of finding common ground between the candidates' coalitions.Over the course of several months, the task forces  produced a 110-page document  focused on topics like the economy and climate, and Biden went on to incorporate a number of the recommendations into his campaign platform and first-term agenda.The partnership between Biden and Sanders helped deliver the Vermont senator's supporters, including young voters, into Biden's camp. Four years later, Sanders still backs Biden. The two appeared together recently in  a video  posted on the Biden campaign's TikTok account.But as Biden seeks a second term with low approval ratings, he faces a new struggle to win over young voters who were crucial to his first election. And as an incumbent with no high-profile primary opponent to join forces with, a similar unity moment like the 2020 task forces may not be an option.To Sanders' chief political adviser, Faiz Shakir, part of the difference now is that Biden has to answer to his own record.""He owns the policy direction in a way that in 2020 he didn't,"" Shakir said. ""He was offering policy directions and saying, 'Put me into office.' Now he owns the Middle East policy, Ukraine policy, migrant policy. There's an assumption, expectation, that Joe Biden has to deliver on different policy outcomes that particularly young people would like to see.""And many young people don't like what they see. According to the latest  NPR/ PBS NewsHour /Marist poll , among voters under 30, 6 in 10 disapprove of Biden's job as president, the highest of any age group.But Shakir remains hopeful that the president can rally a voter coalition similar to what he had four years ago, partially because of Biden's ability to absorb critical feedback. ""What has been a consistent thread of Joe Biden's life as a politician, he's in some sense not like Bernie Sanders, who I think has appropriately and stubbornly held certain positions and has been right about them,"" Shakir said. ""Biden is authentic in that he's always indicated: I will move on my positions, on certain ones, if you can show me that the center or that the majority, that the movement is in a different place.""<h2>Looking back at a unique partnership</h2>Sanders entered the 2020 primary with strong support among young voters. ""He spoke to young people and their importance on a regular basis,"" said Shana Gallagher, Sanders' national student organizing director, in 2020. ""And that is actually very rare for candidates to do, especially in a consistent, genuine way.""Over two presidential campaigns in 2016 and 2020, Sanders rose in popularity among many young voters by backing key progressive issues, including a push for universal health care and significant increases in government spending to combat climate change.When Cristóbal Alex thinks back to April 2020, he recalls the value of Sanders' endorsement. ""It was a very important one, maybe the most important ever,"" said Alex, who served as a senior adviser to the Biden campaign and sat on the immigration-focused policy task force. ""Bernie played a huge role in bringing young folks over,"" he added. Carmel Martin was a senior policy adviser to Biden's 2020 campaign and coordinated the task forces.""It was a way that we could send a signal to the people who were supporting Sen. Sanders,"" Martin said. ""That what they cared about mattered to President Biden as well.""Allies of both the president and Sanders point to policies implemented throughout Biden's first term that can be linked back to the task forces — including  major investments in climate change prevention  and  infrastructure  and  attempts to relieve  billions in  student debt  — wins that Biden now touts on the campaign trail again.<h2>4 years later, Biden holds on to those partnerships</h2>Sanders has continued to work with Biden throughout his first term, including holding  private meetings  over issue messaging. To the Biden campaign, a second term is about building on the work started four years ago. Because of that, they argue there isn't necessarily a need for another prominent coming-together moment that echoes the task forces. ""We're already part of a coalition,"" said Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., a Biden campaign surrogate. ""So we don't have to fight our way in. We just have to continue making our voices heard. And the president is still listening to us.""Despite initially supporting and working for Sanders in the 2020 primary, Frost, who is the first Gen Z member of the U.S. House, has been pushing young voters to give Biden another chance. ""I think progressives have always had a knack for being able to communicate to voters across party lines and help inspire disaffected voters,"" Frost said. ""And I think whether it's Bernie [Sanders] or myself or many progressives, we still have something to give in terms of helping to influence the messaging, and not just the messaging but the action that backs up the messaging in this election so people can turn out.""<h2>Divides remain among Democratic voters</h2>But while many progressives like Frost and Sanders campaign for Biden, it's unclear how many of the policy wins they tout have resonated with younger voters. Just 1 in 10 voters under 30 say Biden's policies have helped them personally, according to a recent poll by  The New York Times and Siena College .Instead, Biden is battling  lower enthusiasm  to vote compared with four years ago, as well as  doubts over his age . And he's faced pressure from many  younger voters  to demand a permanent cease-fire and stop additional aid to Israel in its war in Gaza — as the death toll climbs past 33,000, according to Gaza's health ministry.Despite his past popularity among progressives, Sanders is not entirely in lockstep with the left wing of the party on the issue. In the initial months after the Hamas attack on Oct. 7 that killed 1,200 people, according to Israel, Sanders received pushback from progressives,  including previous campaign staff , for refusing to call for a cease-fire.The Vermont senator has  acknowledged that the president's position on Israel  could cost him votes, particularly from  young voters  and  nonwhite voters . Biden's  public posture on the war  has changed. He now supports a temporary cease-fire and is more critical of Israel's continued military campaign. But he's yet to go to the extent many progressives want. When thinking about avenues to mend some of today's divisions, alums of the Sanders 2020 campaign draw back on Biden's willingness to collaborate four years ago.""Joe Biden is undeniably a politically astute leader,"" said Analilia Mejia, Sanders' 2020 political director. ""Now, that doesn't mean perfection, but that means understanding where people are and understanding when there is a need to shift.""Mejia, who coordinated the task forces for the Sanders side, argued that watching Biden begin to shift his position on U.S. involvement in the Israel war is a testament to his political skill.Shakir says Sanders is now urging Biden to lay out a second-term progressive agenda, and that Sanders has a frank pitch for Biden moving forward: Acknowledge problems and explain how they're being addressed.""Even on the issues where there's the most division,"" Shakir said, referencing the war in Gaza. ""You don't have to mask it. Be honest with them. And it's the reason why we have to continue in this direction because the other choice would certainly set us backwards.""The Biden campaign has six months to boost the youth vote. According to the latest  NPR/ PBS NewsHour /Marist poll , a third of Gen Z and millennial voters have a good idea who they'll vote for but could still switch, and 17% have not made a decision. And when Shakir thinks about why young voters aren't on board yet, there's a simple answer. ""They're not done pushing him,"" he explained. ""And to his credit, Joe Biden's always indicated, yeah, keep pushing me.""",2024-04-12 12:01:00 PM EEST,NPR,"4 years ago, Sanders and Biden united Democrats. Biden needs young progressives again",https://www.npr.org/2024/04/12/1244155069/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-young-voters
Ashley Lopez,"Running for president isn't easy when you aren't part of one of the major political parties.While Democrats and Republicans don't have to petition a state to appear on a ballot, independent and many third-party candidates do.Running as an independent candidate can be  particularly difficult  because of high signature requirements — often on short timelines. And some states even limit which voters candidates can get signatures from.For example, an independent candidate seeking a spot on Texas' 2024 ballot has about two months to gather 113,151 signatures of registered voters ""who did not vote in the presidential primary of either party,""  according to state election officials .There is a workaround to these kinds of rules, though: A candidate can start their own political party and run as a member of that party.That's because states such as Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Mississippi, North Carolina and Texas make it significantly easier to get on the ballot as a minor-party candidate, compared with running as an independent candidate.As a result, presidential candidates like anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and progressive scholar Cornel West have decided to create their own political parties — the  We the People  party and the  Justice for All Party , respectively — to get on the ballot in some states.This month, the Kennedy campaign  announced  it had gathered enough signatures to put his We the People party on North Carolina's ballot this year.In North Carolina, a political party only needs to gather  more than 13,000 signatures  of voters to get on the ballot. To run as an independent candidate in 2024, though, campaigns need to gather  more than 83,000 signatures  to qualify for the ballot.West initially planned to run as a member of the Green Party. Running as a member of the long-established Green Party would have made the task of getting on state ballots across the U.S. much easier. But West ultimately decided  not to seek the party's nomination . (His campaign says he has so far  gotten on ballots in three states  using other minor parties' access.)Richard Winger, who publishes a monthly newsletter called Ballot Access News, said it's ""irrational"" that some states ""make it much harder for an independent candidate to get on the ballot than for a new party.""""And the reason that's irrational is the whole point of ballot access restrictions is to keep the ballot from being too crowded,"" Winger said. ""And an independent candidate doesn't affect the ballot much because it's just one guy or woman. But a new party could have a big impact on the ballot because the new party might run candidates for every single partisan office.""<h2>The purpose of minor parties</h2>Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in governance studies and the director of the Center for Effective Public Management at the Brookings Institution, said it makes sense why independent candidates would use this workaround to get on the ballot.But, Kamarck said, it's ""sort of an abuse of the law.""She said political parties are not meant to be a reflection of one person's campaign or an empty vehicle to get one person on a ballot.""We want, in a democracy, political parties to be able to form and run candidates,"" she said. ""So, you know, I see why the states have done this.However, Kamarck said what Kennedy and others are doing is creating parties that are not really meant to operate like most political parties.""The problem is, this isn't real. No more than No Labels was real,"" she said, referring to the centrist group that had obtained ballot access in a number of states before  dropping its proposal to run a presidential ticket . ""This is not a reflection of a coherent group of people deciding to form a party and run in various offices.""In contrast, Kamarck said, the Green Party runs candidates up and down the ballot each year.""They've run candidates for county commissioner. They've run candidates for Congress,"" she said. ""In other words, they've consistently tried to participate in elections as parties do.

Nina Totenberg,"The U.S. Supreme Court appeared divided on Tuesday, with conservatives expressing various degrees of skepticism about the statute used to prosecute more than 350 people involved with the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol. At least partially on the line at Tuesday's argument was the Justice Department's effort to punish some of those it deems the more serious participants in the Capitol riot. Roughly one-quarter of those prosecuted so far for their roles in the Capitol invasion have been charged with violating a federal statute enacted after the Enron scandal in 2002, a scandal that involved massive document shredding and fraud.One part of the law makes it a crime to ""corruptly"" alter or destroy documents and records related to an official proceeding. The second part makes it a crime to  otherwise  obstruct or impede an official proceeding, including a congressional proceeding.Joseph Fischer, a former police officer charged in the riot, is challenging the use of the second provision, asserting that it was never meant, as the government claims, to be a catchall obstruction law. His lawyer faced a grilling from the court's three liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson. Kagan suggested that, in her view, Congress wrote the second part of the law to ""plug gaps"" in the then-existing obstruction statutes. In short, as she put it, ""It was meant to function as a backstop.""Jackson said that trying to prevent the electoral count seemed to her like an obstruction of an official proceeding. And Sotomayor said that if this statute doesn't seem to be an exact match for the Jan. 6 attack, that is because there had never been an event like this one before.But Fischer's lawyer, Jeffrey Green, seemed to have a willing audience in the court's six conservative members. They aimed their most skeptical questions at Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar and her assertion that the statute was meant to be a broad obstruction provision. Justice Clarence Thomas observed that there have been other violent protests that interfered with official proceedings. Have federal prosecutors ""applied this provision to other protests in the past?"" he asked. Prelogar replied that the Justice Department has enforced the law, applying it in the past to cases that involved more than document destruction and evidence tampering.Justice Neil Gorsuch asked whether ""a sit-in that disrupts a trial or access to a federal courthouse qualify? Would a heckler in today's audience qualify or at the State of the Union address?""Those actions would  not  meet the criteria of corruptly and intentionally violating this law, replied Prelogar. Justice Samuel Alito followed up, posing this question: ""Let's say that today while you're arguing, five people get up, and they shout either, 'Keep the Jan. 6 insurrectionists in jail,' or 'Free the Jan. 6 patriots.' And our police officers have to remove them forcibly"" — would that be a violation of this statute?""No,"" replied Prelogar, because the government doesn't think this statute picks up such ""minimal"" interferences with proceedings. Justice Kagan interjected at this point, asking the solicitor general what sort of evidence the government typically presents in these Jan. 6 prosecutions. Prelogar replied that the government has to prove that the defendants specifically intended to disrupt the joint meeting of Congress where the electoral votes were to be counted.""We have focused on things like preparation for violence, bringing tactical gear or paramilitary equipment to the Capitol,"" she said.Prelogar added that prosecutors have brought charges against 1,350 defendants in connection with Jan. 6, but because of the need to show intent to prevent the counting of the electoral ballots, only about 350 of those defendants have been charged with obstruction. Addressing the concern voiced by several justices that the penalty for violating this provision carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, Prelogar said that the average sentence among the the individuals charged only with this obstruction statute is 26 months imprisonment, and the median has been 24 months. So, she contended, ""There's no reasonable  argument to be made that the statutory maximum here is driving anything with respect to sentencing."" Still, Chief Justice John Roberts remained doubtful, also probing whether the Justice Department has similarly applied this statute in other cases. Prelogar replied that there is a key difference between statutes that do not require an intent to obstruct and this one, which  does  have that proof of intent requirement.That, however, didn't seem to allay the ""concerns"" of the remaining two conservative justices, Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh. Kavanaugh noted there are six other counts in the indictment of the defendant in this case, including civil disorder and assault. ""Why aren't those six counts good enough, just from the Justice Department's perspective, given that they don't have any hurdles?"" he asked.""Because those counts don't fully reflect the culpability of petitioner's conduct on Jan. 6,"" answered Prelogar. Fisher ""had said in advance of Jan. 6 that he was prepared to storm the Capitol, prepared to use violence. He wanted to intimidate Congress. He said, 'They can't vote if they can't breathe.' And then he went to the Capitol on Jan. 6 with that intent in mind and took action, including assaulting a law enforcement officer.""If the court rules in favor of defendant Fischer, a number of the 350 people charged under the obstruction statute will likely have to be resentenced or released from prison. Indeed, some have already been conditionally released, pending the outcome of the case. The obstruction section of the law is also the basis for at at least one, and arguably two, of the charges against Donald Trump in the election obstruction case currently pending against him in Washington, D.C. So, if the Supreme Court ultimately rules that both parts of the obstruction law are aimed at document and evidence manipulation, Trump's lawyers would almost certainly seek to have those counts dismissed. Special counsel Jack Smith has indicated that regardless of how the Supreme Court rules in Tuesday's case, the charges against Trump would survive; because the former president is charged with creating slates of fake electors, Smith has said, that ties his conduct more firmly to  both  parts of the the obstruction statute.

Asma Khalid,"President Biden wants to hike tariffs on imports of Chinese steel and aluminum, a case he made in a speech on Wednesday at the headquarters of the United Steelworkers union in Pittsburgh.""Folks, you've had my back, and I promise I have your back,"" Biden told cheering union members, listing a series of measures he has taken to support unions, the steel sector, and the battleground state of Pennsylvania.It's the latest in a series of steps Biden has taken to try to shore up his support in a state that could make or break his reelection bid. Former President Donald Trump had made support for the steel industry a central part of his 2016 and 2020 runs for office. Trump has said he wants to  increase tariffs on a range of  imports  if he wins this November.Since taking office in 2020, Biden has largely kept in place the signature tariff and trade policies of his predecessor, while also creating massive government programs to spur infrastructure projects, the semiconductor manufacturing sector and clean energy projects. Those programs have spurred demand for steel.""Everything we build, we build with American product and with American workers — period,"" Biden said.Chinese steel imports account for less than 1% of U.S. demand, officials told reporters. But Chinese subsidies and programs mean its steel prices are 40% lower than U.S. prices, and the Biden administration said it wants to head off any surge of exports.""For too long, the Chinese government has poured state money into Chinese steel companies,"" Biden told union members, saying that had led to cheap exports. ""They're not competing — they're cheating,"" he said.<h2>Biden says his tariff plan is targeted</h2>Biden is asking U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai — who has been reviewing tariffs on Chinese goods since Biden took office — to triple tariffs for steel and aluminum under what's known as Section 301. Currently, those tariffs average 7.5%.Steel and aluminum imports from China are also subject to another type of tariff, known as Section 232. If the USTR follows through on Biden's request, the cumulative impact would mean Chinese steel faces tariffs of 50%, and Chinese aluminum tariffs of 35%.Biden, who is under pressure because of voter concerns about the high cost of living, said his tariffs would be ""targeted"" and contrast them with  Trump's statements  that he would put tariffs on imported goods from all countries. Broad tariffs would raise costs and hurt U.S. consumers, Biden said.Biden also said he sent a team of officials to speak with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to talk about preventing Chinese steel from making its way into the United States under preferential rates given to Mexico.The USW recently endorsed Biden after he took the unusual step of speaking out against a takeover deal by Japanese company Nippon Steel for U.S. Steel, which is based in Pittsburgh.""It should remain a totally American company,"" Biden said in his remarks. ""American owned, American operated, by American union steelworkers — the best in the world — and that's going to happen, I promise you,"" he said.",2024-04-17 22:46:00 PM EEST,NPR,Biden tells Pittsburgh steelworkers he wants to hike tariffs on Chinese steel,https://www.npr.org/2024/04/17/1245184430/biden-wants-to-hike-tariffs-on-imports-of-chinese-steel-and-aluminum
Nina Totenberg,"The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday granted Idaho's emergency request to temporarily revive a state law banning gender-affirming care for children under the age of 18. The law, which makes it a felony for doctors to medically treat gender dysphoria in minors, will now go into effect except in the case of two anonymous plaintiffs who have until now been treated with hormones and may continue to receive treatment. In the Idaho case, the state was  not  asking the court to address transgender rights head-on. Instead, the state asked the justices to consider whether the scope of the lower court's order blocking the law was appropriate. Idaho argued that the district court judge only had authority to stop the law from applying to the two plaintiffs in the lawsuit, not to prevent its enforcement throughout the state. A majority of the justices appeared to adopt that novel legal theory on how to treat such emergency applications to the court, though there appeared to be two different camps splitting the conservatives and no clear delineation of what the rule will be henceforth. Chief Justice John Roberts gave no indication of his views and joined neither of the lengthy opinions of Justices Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito, nor the opinion of Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, dissented. Justice Elena Kagan noted that she would have denied the application for a stay but did not join the dissent.Nonetheless, the jumble of opinions would appear, at least potentially, to have  far-reaching consequences by dramatically limiting the effects of any constitutional challenge to a state or federal law.  While today's action is temporary, so too were the actions of the lower courts, which blocked the law from going into effect while the case was litigated. As a result of Monday's Supreme Court action, the law will take effect immediately and will remain in effect during the ongoing litigation over its constitutionality. Waiting in the wings are several more bans similar to the one at issue in Idaho. Two of them — from Kentucky and Tennessee — are at the Supreme Court with petitions seeking full review, as opposed to the preliminary review in the Idaho case. The Kentucky and Tennessee laws banning gender-affirming care for minors are currently in effect. Last year, the court chose not to hear two disputes related to transgender issues, one involving mistreatment of a transgender prisoner and one about a state ban on trans students' participation in sports. Some 21 states passed laws restricting gender-affirming care for minors last year. All contend they are protecting children from dangerous, unproven treatments they may come to regret later. Transgender advocates vehemently disagree with that characterization of broadly accepted medical standards of care for gender dysphoria. They caution that medical treatment options are critical to combating anxiety and depression in trans youth and preventing suicide. Both sides agree that not all treatments are appropriate for all ages. But left unresolved is who has the right to decide what is appropriate for each patient: parents and doctors, or the state legislature?The plaintiffs in this case are two anonymous trans girls who used puberty blockers and currently take estrogen to treat gender dysphoria. Idaho's court filings call them ""adolescent boys."" The district court found that discontinuing their care would cause ""severe psychological distress.""The district court said that the entire law needed to be paused to prevent a flood of lawsuits from every person wanting to continue treatment and to allow the two plaintiffs to actually receive the requested medical care. Lawyers for the plaintiffs also argued that doctors and pharmacists would be reluctant to risk up to 10 years in prison to provide treatment to anyone, plaintiff or not, unless the law is on hold. Monday's Supreme Court ruling will test that theory.",2024-04-16 01:13:00 AM EEST,NPR,Supreme Court temporarily revives Idaho law banning gender affirming care for minors,https://www.npr.org/2024/04/15/1238351984/supreme-court-transgender-rights-gender-affirming-care-idaho
Shaylee Ragar,"Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, a third-generation farmer from Montana, is one of  Republicans' top political targets  this year as they try to win back control of the Senate.  Tester is the last Democrat holding statewide office as Republicans have dominated recent elections in Montana. He's campaigning for a fourth term in one of just four U.S. Senate races identified as toss-ups by  The Cook Political Report .In a political career that's spanned more than two decades, first in the state legislature then in the U.S. Senate, Tester has carved out an identity as a moderate — focusing on agriculture, education and veterans' issues. At a fundraiser last month in Helena, Mont., Tester described what it's like being a Democrat in an increasingly Republican state. ""The progress we make as Democrats in this state are hard fought,"" Tester said. ""We have to earn them inch by inch."" <h2>With the Senate in the balance, Tester walks a tightrope</h2>The stakes, both in Montana and nationally, have outside groups pouring money into the race. More than $32 million has been spent so far in ads this cycle on the race. According to an NPR analysis of data from the tracking firm Ad Impact, just over $12 million of that is coming from GOP groups and more than $19 million is from Democratic spending. Tester's campaign is the biggest ad spender so far with more than $10 million spent.    Republican ads  in this year's race have described the senator as ""two-face Tester,"" claiming he's beholden to special interests instead of Montana voters. Tester is a  top recipient of lobbyist cash  among members of Congress, according to Open Secrets, which tracks campaign-finance spending. He's raised about  $33 million so far  in his reelection campaign, according to recent FEC filings. That's four times the amount his top GOP opponent, Tim Sheehy, has raised and  more than Tester raised  in total for his 2018 campaign. In an interview with NPR in February, Tester rejected criticism that money influences his politics. ""This is part of the Republican strategy that they've always had to try to make me into something I'm not so they can run against that person, because they can't beat the dirt farmer from Big Sandy, Montana, who looks out for rural America,"" Tester said. That identity has been central to his staying power as Montana's senior senator.  But when it comes to actual votes — his staying power is won by slim margins. In all three of his bids for Senate, Tester has never won  more than 51% of the vote . He tries to appeal to voters by highlighting what he sees as a record of working across the aisle. An example he often cites is his work as chair of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee to gain bipartisan support of the  PACT Act . Signed into law in 2022, with bipartisan support, it expanded health benefits for millions of veterans who were exposed to toxins while on active duty. ""Montanans understand that you need to work together. They understand the division is bad,"" Tester said when discussing his approach to reaching across the aisle. ""And they appreciate when they have someone who's willing to roll up their sleeves and get things done.""<h2>A Democrat who isn't always in step with his own party</h2>That approach also means Big Sky voters at times hear talking points from their lone Democrat in Congress they may be more familiar hearing from GOP candidates.Tester was the only Democrat to  co-sponsor legislation  to prevent China, Russia, Iran and North Korea from buying agricultural land in the U.S. The legislation was introduced last year by GOP Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota.Just last week, Tester  posted a video to social media  where he pressed  Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas at a Senate hearing, demanding he ""step up"" to fix the southern border. He also released  an ad  this month critical of President Biden's border policies. The ad touts Tester working with Republicans to ""shut down the border, target fentanyl traffickers and add hundreds of new border patrol agents.""His rivals, however, are quick to point out times Tester has aligned with Democrats and Biden.Sheehy said in a statement that Tester's vote with Democrats on Wednesday to dismiss Mayorkas' impeachment trial shows that he ""does more for illegal immigrants in Washington than he does for legal taxpaying American citizens.""Earlier this year, the Republican-led House  voted to impeach  Mayorkas saying he failed to enforce immigration policies. But on Wednesday the U.S. Senate, controlled by Democrats,  rejected the articles of impeachment . Many argued that there was no credible evidence that justified launching an impeachment trial. Tester released his own statement on the vote, saying the state of the southern border is ""unacceptable,"" but that the impeachment is ""a distraction that fails to make our country safer.""<h2>Tester's top GOP rival bets on Trump's appeal in Montana</h2>Sheehy was handpicked to run by Montana's junior U.S. senator, Steve Daines, who is leading Republican efforts to win a Senate majority. Sheehy is considered the frontrunner to win the Republican nomination for Senate in the state's primary in June. Sheehy, a veteran and founder of an aerial firefighting company, is fully embracing former President Donald Trump's brand of conservatism and using that as the reason why voters should elect him instead of Tester. ""Trump will win the White House, but he'll be severely limited on what he can do if he doesn't have a Senate to back him up,"" Sheehy said earlier this year. Sheehy also boasts about his endorsement from Trump. Having last run for reelection in 2018, Tester's never shared a ticket with Trump, who won Montana by 16 points in 2020.An  Emerson College poll  completed in early March found that about 14% of Montana voters who support Trump plan to split their ticket in November and also vote for Tester. The poll also found 71% support Sheehy. Montana State University political scientist Jessi Bennion thinks Tester is facing the fight of his professional life. ""He's absolutely trying to distance himself from Washington, D.C., Democrats,"" Bennion said. ""That's smart, he absolutely has to do that to win here.""

"Don Gonyea,Lexie Schapitl","ERIE, Pa. - On a recent weeknight in Erie, Pa., the local minor league hockey team hosted a playoff game for the first time in years. The home team Erie Otters faced off against the Kitchener Rangers from Ontario, Canada. But even as fans watched the action on the ice, another kind of face-off isn't far from the minds of Erie County residents. ""You go down different blocks or different streets and you see something, you know, Trump or Biden,"" said 34-year-old Bekah Mook, who was at the game. ""You can't even have a glass of beer unless something is mentioned Democrat or Republican.""""It's everywhere you turn,"" she said. While most counties across the country predictably lean Democrat or Republican, Erie County, in the northwest corner of Pennsylvania, is what election watchers call a ""boomerang county."" It boomeranged from Democrats to Republicans and back in recent presidential election cycles. The county went for former President Barack Obama twice, then former President Donald Trump in 2016, and  narrowly for President Biden in 2020 . Now everyone is trying to predict what will happen this year. <h2>'How Erie goes, Pennsylvania goes'</h2>Biden won Erie County in 2020 by less than 1,500 votes, or 1.03 percentage points. In 2016, the margin was less than 2,000 votes for Trump. Mook, who works in a mental health practice, is one of those voters who flipped. She comes from a family of Christian Republicans, and once considered herself solidly in that camp. She supported Trump in 2016, largely due to her opposition to abortion. But her feelings changed as she watched Trump in office. ""Now I'm looking at everything else. And there are so many more issues than just abortion,"" she said. One thing that particularly bothered her was Trump's policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, and the images of children being kept in detention at border facilities. ""I have 19 nieces and nephews, no kids right now, and I'm just a kid person,"" Mook said. ""So when I see kids like that I'm just like, 'Oh, that's disgusting.'""As for this year, Mook says she's still going back and forth with her presidential vote. She's currently leaning ""60% Democratic."" Another Erie County voter at the arena that night, 22-year-old Ethan Haynes, says he's an independent, but this year he's all in for Biden. For him, democracy is on the ballot. ""I think that with Trump and his messaging has very much shown that he is unwilling to give up power if he gets it again,"" Haynes said. Head out to the more rural parts of the county, outside the city of Erie, and you find a much more conservative type of voter. After finishing his breakfast at a classic old diner in Girard, Pa., 66-year-old Tim Stevenson said he'll be backing Trump. ""We can't go through another four years of Joe Biden,"" said Stevenson, a retired township police officer who now runs an auto repair shop. ""I don't think he has the capability to run an ice cream stand.""<h2>It's all about turnout</h2>The local political party chairmen in Erie have long histories in the county, and both know that this place could be pivotal in November. ""Erie County actually mimics the state very closely demographically,"" explained Sam Talarico, the Erie County Democratic Party chair. ""We have an urban core, we have suburban areas. And if you go south of Interstate 90, it's rural,"" he said. ""So that's why we're kind of a bellwether county. We see how Erie goes, Pennsylvania goes. And that's that's been true in the last few elections.""Talarico says his job this year is to drive turnout. That means the grunt work of campaigning: door knocking, phone banking and voter registration drives. ""I think most people have already made up their minds because both of these candidates have been in the White House and they know who they are,"" he explained.""So our real challenge is to find new voters and, you know, hopefully get them on our side,"" Talarico said. <h2>Mail-in voting might make the difference</h2>Across town at the local Republican Party headquarters, county Chair Tom Eddy has a different goal: getting more Republicans to vote by mail. Democrats currently have a massive advantage when it comes to mail-in ballots. While Biden won Erie by just over a single percentage point in 2020, he won 75% of the county's mail-in ballots. The same dynamic played out for Democrats in the 2022 midterms and 2023 state judicial elections. That's a big problem for the GOP. Eddy puts it in very blunt terms, saying Republicans have been losing elections they could have won because voters in his party don't believe in mail-in balloting.That rejection of a type of voting that is legal and in wide use in the state comes in large part because the practice has been loudly vilified by Trump, who has repeatedly lied and called it a major source of voter fraud, falsely citing mail-in voting as a cause of his 2020 defeat. There is no evidence of any such problems with mail-in ballots.Eddy, without himself completely dismissing or dispelling the incorrect claims of mail-in ballot fraud, does insist it's time for Republicans to move on. He says it's time to play to win, and that needs to include embracing mail-in voting.  ""I still have people that are adamant against them (mail in ballots), they say, 'Well, it's it's it's an avenue for fraud.' And I said, 'Yeah, it could be,'"" Eddy said. ""But we've got to play that game. Otherwise we lose. We can't win an election without them.""Eddy and Talarico both see advantages when it comes to mail-in voting: It allows voters more flexibility and makes it easier to vote, thus boosting turnout.  It also allows party officials to focus their ""get out the vote"" efforts. Applications for a mail-in ballot are public information, and so is whether or not those ballots have been submitted. That means campaigns can reach out to voters directly and remind them to turn in their votes. Voters can also check a box and have a mail-in ballot automatically sent to them for all future elections, making it even more likely they'll vote in the future. That's a huge help to political parties, and right now an area where Democrats enjoy a huge edge. As a Republican, Eddy describes that option this way: ""If you can get people to check that [box], that's the best thing in the world."" <h2>Lies about voter fraud stoke Republican skepticism</h2>But as Eddy tries to spread the gospel of mail-in voting to Republicans, he knows he's facing an uphill battle. He tells the story of what he encountered when he tried to hand out mail-in ballot applications at a Trump rally in Erie last summer. ""I started at 6:30 in the morning, and I went to everybody that was lined up, all 10,000 people, and I asked them, 'Here's a mail in ballot,' and I gave them my reasons why. And the majority of those people said, 'No,' because, one, Donald doesn't endorse it and two, it's fraud,"" Eddy remembered.  He says that he only managed to get about 300 people in that crowd of thousands to sign up. Trump's lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election that he lost have been convincing. That why it's easy to find that distrust in mail-in voting when you talk to Republican voters. ""I think you should go to the polls with your license and prove who you are and vote. That's it,"" Tim Stevenson, the auto repair shop owner, said. Stevenson plans to vote in person.  State Sen. Dan Laughlin of Erie thinks that mindset leaves a lot to chance — bad weather or a flat tire on Election Day could keep you at home.Laughlin was a rare Republican supporter of mail-in voting back in 2020, and he says former President Trump does Republicans a disservice by continuing to bad-mouth mail-in ballots.""If by chance, you use this clip in your interview and it gets back to him and he hears it, I hope he's listening,"" Laughlin said. ""Because he's the only one that can fix it. Because the rest of us are trying, right?""If Republicans don't get competitive on mail-in ballots, Laughlin said, ""We're going to get our clock cleaned.""",2024-04-13 12:01:00 PM EEST,NPR,This Pennsylvania county picks presidents.

"Claudia Grisales,Deirdre Walsh","To debate or not debate? That's the question facing the upper chamber Wednesday ahead of afternoon plans to swear in all 100 senators as jurors in  the impeachment trial  against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was expected to dispose of the charges, with either a motion to dismiss or by tabling them, but discussions continued late Tuesday for a potential bipartisan deal for debate. A deal had yet to be reached by early Wednesday. ""We want to address this issue as expeditiously as possible,"" Schumer said Tuesday. ""Impeachment should never be used to settle a policy disagreement. Talk about awful precedents."" The trial comes roughly two months after House Republicans  voted to impeach  Mayorkas by one vote, the tightest of margins. The  House impeachment managers  delivered the articles to the Senate on Tuesday, triggering the next steps in a trial. ""Alejandro N. Mayorkas thus warrants impeachment and trial, removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States,"" the lead House impeachment manager, House Homeland Security Committee Chair Mark Green, R-Tenn., read from the  resolution  to the Senate chamber.  The Democratic-led Senate is not expected to convict or remove Mayorkas.<h2>What the charges are</h2>The House impeachment  resolution i ncludes two charges — willfully ignoring the law and breaching the public's trust. At the center of the procedural fight is the U.S.-Mexico border and the people who have crossed it in record numbers. Republicans accuse Mayorkas of refusing to enforce immigration laws, Democrats and the Biden administration say Republicans have a policy disagreement with the White House and impeachment isn't the way to address it. Republicans in both chambers are eager to put the issue of border security front and center during this election year. President Biden's handling of the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border remains a weak spot politically for him, according to  recent public opinion polls . <h2>Republicans demand debate</h2>No other legislative business can be taken up during the trial, unless all 100 senators agree otherwise. That's a concern for Democrats, with Congress facing a Friday deadline to renew legislation to extend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, which remains quite controversial. Congress is also debating  additional aid for Israel , following the attack from Iran over the weekend. However, a conservative wing of Senate Republicans has joined their House counterparts in  calling for debate  on the charges facing Mayorkas. On Tuesday, Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, a moderate, joined the calls. ""I far prefer having a debate and discussion of some kind or a trial or a committee discussion,"" Romney told NPR. ""I think a motion to table sets a very unfortunate constitutional precedent.""Democrats are watching moderate Republicans like Romney very closely in the narrowly controlled chamber because he is a key swing vote who could help wrap the effort up as quickly as possible. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday on the floor that ""history and precedent dictate"" that the Senate hold a trial.""It would be beneath the Senate's dignity to shrug off our clear responsibility and fail to give the charges we'll hear today the thorough consideration they deserve,"" he said.House Speaker Mike Johnson had earlier urged Schumer in a written statement to hold a public trial.

Ximena Bustillo,"NEW YORK — Jury selection began Monday in Manhattan criminal court for Donald Trump's hush-money trial — the first time in U.S. history a former president is being tried on criminal charges.More than half of prospective jurors in the first panel of 96 people were excused after saying they could not be fair and impartial. An 18-person jury selection  is expected to take several days and the trial is expected to last about six weeks — even as Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, campaigns to be president once again.Trump faces  34 felony counts  alleging that he falsified New York business records in order to conceal damaging information to influence the 2016 presidential election. To start the day in court Monday, the parties debated potential evidence and whether Trump has violated a gag order.The judge overseeing the case, Juan Merchan, had issued  a gag order  on Trump that specifically bars him from making, or directing others to make, public statements about witnesses, prosecutors or jurors. He later extended the order to cover the families of those people after Trump went after the judge's daughter by name on the former president's social media site.Merchan said he will hold a hearing on April 23 about the prosecution's request to have Trump held in contempt of the gag order for several social media posts about potential witnesses in the case. <h2>""Trump wants to be present at everything""</h2>Arriving to the courtroom Monday, Trump reiterated his complaint that the case is political persecution. ""This is a persecution like never before,"" he told reporters. ""It's an assault on America and that's why I am very proud to be here, this is an assault on our country.""To the extent possible, Trump plans to be involved in court conferences and the jury selection process, defense attorney Todd Blanche said Monday. ""President Trump wants to be present at everything,"" Blanche said. Merchan warned that if Trump disrupts the proceeding, he could be jailed, with the trial continuing in his absence.The trial comes just months before the presidential election in November. Most polls show Trump in a tight race with President Biden, his successor to the presidency. Trump must balance his legal troubles — he faces dozens of state and federal charges — with the election cycle, though his predicament hasn't dampened enthusiasm for him among his most ardent supporters.Trump's other major trials — related to his role in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, his handling of classified documents and alleged election interference in Georgia — are in various stages of delay, and it is unlikely that a verdict in any of them will come before the election. A decision in the New York criminal case could come by summer of this year.At the same time, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments  later this month  on whether Trump enjoys blanket immunity for his actions as president, and what it decides could have ramifications for the presidency.<h2>The district attorney hopes to make this case about 2016 election interference</h2>A  grand jury indicted Trump in the spring of last year , marking the first time a former or sitting president faced criminal charges.  Republicans  quickly dismissed the indictment  as an overreach of power  by District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who had brought the charges. Trump has pleaded not guilty.At the center of the trial are 11 ""hush money"" payments to adult film actor Stormy Daniels who, at the time Trump was first running for president, threatened to go public with accusations she'd had an affair with him not long after he married Melania Trump.The lawsuit alleges that payments were made from Trump's flagship Trump Organization to Michael Cohen, then a vice president and counsel at the company. The payments were described by the Trump Organization falsely as ""legal retainers""; they were, in fact, reimbursements to Cohen for paying Daniels.Cohen transferred that money to Daniels less than two weeks before the 2016 election. After Trump won, he reimbursed Cohen, including with his own personal checks. Trump has denied an affair with Daniels, but in  2018 he admitted reimbursing Cohen for money paid to her , arguing it had nothing to do with the campaign.The  indictment also includes a separate $150,000  payment to another woman — the  Playboy model Karen McDougal, who has spoken openly about her experience  — who also claimed to have had an intimate relationship with Trump.The fact of the payments and the false records isn't in dispute. What Bragg has to prove is that Trump made them in order to further other crimes, such as violating campaign finance law and mischaracterizing the payments for tax purposes.In 2018, Cohen admitted to paying Daniels $130,000 — pleading guilty to eight  counts including criminal tax evasion and campaign finance violations  — and implicated Trump. At his plea hearing, Cohen said he organized these payments in  coordination with and at the direction  of then-candidate Trump.<h2>Trump will balance the courtroom and the campaign</h2>As he campaigns for the 2024 presidency — with enough delegates to formally claim the Republican nomination — Trump is facing a combined 88 state and federal charges, including several related to his efforts to try to stay in office after he lost the 2020 election to Biden. This year judges in New York have already ruled against Trump in civil trials: He's been ordered to  pay over $355 million for committing business fraud  and to pay former columnist  E. Jean Carroll $83 million for defamation .He also faces charges in federal court in Washington related to his role in the Jan. 6 attack and in Florida for his handling of classified documents. He also faces state charges in Georgia over allegations of election interference.Trump has received his own string of legal victories on all of these cases in the last month. The Florida and Washington cases are delayed until the Supreme Court rules on whether Trump enjoyed broad immunity as president. A judge in  Georgia threw out three counts  against Trump on the basis that they weren't detailed enough. Prosecutors could appeal the ruling, or go back to a grand jury and indict Trump again with more details. Trump now faces 10 felony counts in the state.As opposed to his civil trials in Manhattan, where he was not required to attend hearings in person (though he did on several occasions), Trump will be required to spend every day of this criminal trial in the courtroom unless a judge rules otherwise. This puts him in New York nearly every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday for at least the next two months. Speaking to reporters after a pretrial hearing in February, Trump vowed to attend court during the day and attend campaign events at night.Trump has spent the last several months using stops in New York courthouses as opportunities to speak to the press about the cases, and about his campaign platform. He has baselessly called the trials politically motivated and railed against them at his rallies across the country.His snowballing legal troubles have been used to fundraise for his campaign. There were big spikes in donations around news events related to the cases he's been involved in and court appearances he's made. The largest amount of any single day came when  his mugshot was released for his criminal case in Georgia .Trump's solicitations for donations from his supporters typically label the trials, without evidence, as ""witch hunts"" and ""election interference."" Recent Federal Election Committee filings show he isn't raising as much as he previously did during these legal events.Trump went from raising about $4 million after pleading not guilty to the alleged hush money payments in New York and again after pleading not guilty to election interference charges in Georgia,  according to Reuters , to only bringing in $200,000 and $400,000 in November and December following major court appearances in his civil fraud trial, including his first testimony on the witness stand.For now, his run-ins with the law have not deterred potential voters and in some instances, it has bolstered support for him. However, a conviction may not play well with independent and swing voters. Although polls generally favor Trump, the latest  NPR/PBS  NewsHour /Marist poll  released last month showed that if Trump were convicted of a crime, Biden opens a 6% point lead, due largely to independent voters.",2024-04-16 00:04:00 AM EEST,NPR,"Trump's criminal trial, a first for a former president, has begun in New York",https://www.npr.org/2024/04/15/1238536885/trump-hush-money-trial
Ximena Bustillo,"NEW YORK — Former President Donald Trump spent the week in the Manhattan Criminal Court. After four days  jurors have been selected to decide his fate . It is the first criminal trial of a former president.Twelve jurors and six alternates were finalized on Friday. Opening arguments are expected to begin on Monday.  Trump faces 34 felony counts alleging that he falsified New York business records in order to conceal damaging information to influence the 2016 presidential election. Trump claims the trial itself is ""election interference"" because of how it is disrupting his 2024 bid for president. Speaking to reporters outside the courtroom earlier in the week, Trump lamented that he is unable to make campaign stops in other states because New York law requires him to be present for his criminal trial, which takes place four days a week.""I'm supposed to be in a lot of different places campaigning. But I've been here all day on a trial that really is a very unfair trial,"" Trump said Thursday after the court session ended.The Trump campaign has announced two upcoming rallies: one in North Carolina on Saturday, and one in south New Jersey on Saturday, May 11.Nearly 300 prospective jurors went through the selection process. They were questioned about their opinions on Trump, their social media history, and their backgrounds. The jurors range from all over Manhattan, including Harlem, Hell's Kitchen, Murray Hill and the Upper West Side. They are litigators, teachers, physical therapists and investment bankers. Their hobbies range from wood and metal working, hiking, fly fishing and exploring New York City.The prospective jurors had varying views of the case and Trump himself — opinions they shared in front of the former president, one by one.""I think sometimes — similar to what one of the jurors said — sometimes the way he may carry himself in public leaves something to be desired. At the same time, I can relate to being a bit unfiltered,"" one prospective juror admitted. ""But at the same time, I see him speak to a lot of people in America, and I think there's something to be said for that.""This juror was not selected.""I don't have strong opinions, but I don't like his persona. How he presents himself in public,"" another prospective juror who made it onto the panel said. ""He seems very selfish and self-serving... I don't really appreciate that from any public servant.""But she went on to make a personal analogy, noting she didn't like all her coworkers but that she didn't try to sabotage their work — so she believed she could be fair and impartial.Another prospective juror, who was not selected, said he saw parallels between himself and Trump and was impressed by his rise as a businessman and politician. The man said he, like Trump, started out as an entrepreneur. ""He was our president. Pretty amazing,"" he said.Ultimately, some self-selected out.""I just couldn't do it,"" mumbled one prospective juror as she exited the courtroom on the first day.Another prospective juror on Friday tearfully voiced that she was nervous and stressed and realized she may not be able to move forward after initially saying she could be impartial.The selected jurors' familiarity of Trump's 88 other state and federal charges varied from unfamiliar to aware Trump faces other charges. Several reported reading and watching major newspapers, cable networks and social media, but two noted, ""I don't watch any news or follow it too closely"" and that they ""don't really care for the news.""One selected juror said he is ""ambivalent"" about Trump; another approved of how Trump ""speaks his mind.""The selected jurors did their best to prove they would be able to separate their political and policy preferences from the legal facts to be presented at trial.One juror said he has ""political views as to the Trump presidency"" and that he thinks there were likely Trump administration policies he disagreed with.Still, he added, ""I don't know the man, and I don't have opinions about him personally.""Judge Juan Merchan has tried to ensure that the jury remains anonymous, citing safety concerns. Jurors are identified by numbers, are not allowed to be photographed or recorded, and only lawyers have access to their names.",2024-04-20 12:00:00 PM EEST,NPR,"What to know about week 1 of Trump's criminal trial, with jury selection complete",https://www.npr.org/2024/04/20/1245755369/what-to-know-about-week-1-of-trumps-criminal-trial-with-jury-selection-complete
Ximena Bustillo,"A full 12 jurors have been selected for former President Donald Trump's criminal trial in New York, along with six alternates. Opening statements are expected to begin on Monday, a week after jury selection began.The trial is expected to last about six weeks — even as Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, campaigns to be president once again.Trump faces 34 felony counts alleging that he falsified New York business records in order to conceal damaging information to influence the 2016 presidential election. Trump himself is also making claims about election interference — though he is concerned about his own current 2024 bid. Speaking to reporters outside the courtroom earlier in the week, Trump lamented that he is unable to make campaign stops in other states because New York law requires him to be present for his criminal trial, which takes place on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays.Still, his campaign remains active. On Tuesday night, Trump visited a bodega in Harlem to tout support from the Bodega and Small Business Group, which represents New York's small convenience stores known as bodegas. He is also expected to show up at a rally in Wilmington, N.C. on Saturday night.<h2>Selecting a fair and impartial jury takes time</h2>From the start of jury selection, 50 of 96 jurors were dismissed when asked if they believed they could be ""fair and impartial."" They could not. Out of the second batch of 96, 40 were excused.But that first question has continued to dismiss jurors. On Tuesday, one prospective juror told New York Judge Juan Merchan that after struggling to sleep overnight and thinking about it, she concluded she could not be fair and impartial. She was dismissed.On Thursday, the third day of jury selection, one selected juror voiced concern that reports in the media may reveal identifying information and her identity potentially being revealed would not allow her to be fair and impartial. She was dismissed after originally being selected.Merchan requested that members of the press not publish potentially identifying information such as physical characteristics or personal information, despite  some being on the questionnaire jurors must fill out  and verbally answer including their current and former employers.A second selected juror was also dismissed Thursday afternoon by Merchan. The reason has not been made public.Earlier in the day, the district attorney's team raised concerns that this juror may have lied on the questionnaire when asked if they had been arrested. Someone of the same name had been arrested in Westchester for tearing down political advertisements in the '90s, said Joshua Steinglass, a prosecutor for the DA's office. And he said it seemed that the juror's wife was previously accused of or involved in a corruption inquiry. They did not know if it was the same person.The Trump legal team has also done their research on these prospective jurors. On Tuesday, there were some potential jurors who were dismissed because of their social media history.   Trump's lawyer Todd Blanche challenged the impartiality of one juror because of her husband's posts about the former president dating back to 2016. Later that day, she was not selected to be a juror.The prospective jurors are also answering their questions in front of the former president, who turns back to look at them.""I certainly follow the news, I'm aware there are other lawsuits out there,"" a prospective juror later selected said. ""But I'm not sure that I know anyone's character.""Another selected juror said they didn't keep up with the news and didn't know much about any of Trump's other cases.""President Trump speaks his mind,"" a third juror said about Trump, but added she does not have a strong opinion either way.As the jury was finalized Friday afternoon, a man set himself on fire outside the courthouse in a public park. New York police said there was no breach in security protocol, and the trial resumed after the incident. Police described the man as a conspiracy theorist; an essay posted to substack, apparently by the same person, details a conspiracy about cryptocurrency.

"Elena Moore,Franco Ordoñez","President Biden marked Earth Day on Monday by launching a  website  for applications for his Climate Corps jobs and training program, a plan that has attracted a lot of interest from young Americans.Biden has been racing to push forward on initiatives that appeal to a generation that was a big part of his 2020 win — a demographic he has struggled with heading into his reelection bid this fall. The latest  NPR/ PBS NewsHour /Marist poll  found that 61% of voters under 30 disapprove of his performance as president.Issues like climate change, gun violence prevention and student loan debt are important for young voters, and in recent weeks, Biden has unveiled a host of initiatives in these areas.Biden launched the  climate service program  last fall, and within weeks the White House received more than 42,000 expressions of interest from Americans, most of them between the ages of 18 and 35.""You'll get paid to fight climate change, learning how to install those solar panels, fight wildfires, rebuild wetlands, weatherize homes, and so much more,"" Biden said.Eventually, the corps will employ more than 20,000 young people, according to the White House.While young climate advocates have applauded the program, they have expressed disappointment with the Biden administration on a number of environmental issues, including the approval of  multiple oil projects , and have urged the president  to declare a climate emergency .<h2>What's next for the Climate Corps</h2>The president made the announcement in northern Virginia at Prince William Forest Park, which was built by  the original Civilian Conservation Corps  — a massive jobs program started by former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the wake of the Great Depression.The first set of jobs will start in June. Americans will be placed with organizations focused on clean energy and helping communities effected by climate change.The new website will initially list about 2,000 jobs, located in 36 states as well as Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico. The White House plans to update the site regularly with new positions. For example, among the jobs listed on Monday, there was a 14-week internship paying $15 per hour to learn how to install solar panels in the Philadelphia area, and a 5-month job on a field crew in Utah paying $16.66 per hour removing invasive species from public lands. Biden said young Americans who take part in the program can also get linked up with training to help land apprenticeship positions through a partnership with the North America's Building Trades Unions. There's also a plan to help people use their new Climate Corps experience to apply for federal government positions.On Monday, Biden also announced $7 billion in grants for solar panel projects for lower-income communities.

"Lexie Schapitl,Barbara Sprunt,Deirdre Walsh,Claudia Grisales","House Speaker Mike Johnson is moving forward with a plan to vote on separate bills to provide assistance to Ukraine, Israel and U.S. allies in the Indo-Pacific, despite growing criticism from within his conference and the  looming threat of being ousted from his post. The plan is to introduce the three individual foreign aid bills; a fourth bill placing sanctions on Russia, China and Iran; and a fifth bill including border security measures, Johnson said in a message to House Republicans Wednesday.  Bill text for the foreign aid bills  was posted Wednesday afternoon.The addition of a border security bill comes after a number of House Republicans criticized Johnson for abandoning prior demands to tie Ukraine funding to border provisions. A Senate-passed package that included foreign aid with no border provisions has been languishing in the House. But the change may not be enough to assuage hardline conservatives, who swiftly came out in opposition of the plan. <h2>What the GOP opposition is</h2>The four bills related to foreign threats are being considered under one procedural ""rule,"" while the border bill will be considered under its own. Rep. Ralph Norman, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus and the House Rules Committee, said that the arrangement would mean the border bill was ""set up to fail."" ""With Ukraine funding in there, then it's got a shot,"" said Norman, R-S.C. ""The thing [Democrats] want is Ukraine.""Norman suggested he would oppose the rule for the aid package if it did not include the border security bill. Republican Reps. Chip Roy of Texas and Thomas Massie of Kentucky also sit on the Rules Committee and have spoken out against the plan. The three met with Speaker Johnson Wednesday to discuss their concerns. Three Republican ""No's"" in committee could defeat the motion before it even comes to the floor. If the legislation does make it past the committee to the floor, Johnson has almost no wiggle room within his razor-thin majority there. Roy,   who opposes Ukraine funding, said he would vote against the rule because ""the border 'vote' in this package is a watered-down dangerous cover vote,"" he  wrote on social media. Speaking to reporters Wednesday afternoon, Johnson reiterated his commitment to bringing the bills to the floor, even if that triggers his opponents to move forward with a push to oust him. Reps. Massie and Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., have co-sponsored a motion to vacate the chair, and have said that Johnson passing aid to Ukraine without border provisions would be a betrayal of the conference. ""I could make a selfish decision. ... But I'm doing here what I believe to be the right thing. I think providing lethal aid to Ukraine right now is critically important,"" Johnson told reporters. ""I'm willing to take personal risk for that because we have to do the right thing and history will judge us."" He added that he has not asked Democrats to help him if the motion to vacate comes to the floor, and that he plans to ""let the chips fall where they may.""<h2>What Democrats are considering</h2>Given the resistance from his right flank, Johnson will need Democratic votes to  get his aid bills to the floor, and if he hopes to survive a motion to vacate. President Biden said he strongly supports the package of aid bills, and urged the House to pass the package this week. Ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., has also  come out in support of the bills. But typically, the minority does not provide votes to procedural rules. Johnson will likely need Democratic votes for the rule to pass out of committee and then again once it's on the floor. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said that his caucus is ""in the process right now of evaluating"" the substance of the aid bills. Democrats will meet Thursday morning to discuss next steps. He did not comment further on whether Democrats might vote in support of the rule, or to defeat a motion to vacate against Johnson.""Once we've made a caucus-wide decision about the substance, then we'll be able to talk about the process and what may lie ahead,"" Jeffries said. ""But we don't want to put the cart before the horse.""Democrats have been calling for Johnson to bring the Senate-passed foreign aid package to the floor, and say providing aid to Ukraine is their top priority. The bill containing military aid for Israel also includes $9 billion of humanitarian assistance to Gaza and other countries, which Democrats had previously said was a requirement for their support.

Tamara Keith,"A Democratic presidential candidate hasn't won Florida since 2012, but President Biden's reelection campaign says a ballot question on reproductive rights could buoy his chances there in November.Earlier this month, the state's Supreme Court allowed a ban on abortion after six weeks of pregnancy — a ban that takes effect on May 1. However, the court also said that voters would decide in November whether to amend the state's constitution to allow for abortions up to about 24 weeks.Biden is campaigning in Tampa today, and plans to lay out ""the stakes of this election for reproductive freedom across the entire country,"" his campaign manager Julie Chávez Rodríguez said in a memo.The ballot measure in Florida could help draw people to the polls in November — people who the campaign said may be persuaded to also vote for Biden.""We've got staff on the ground, you've seen our investments begin to pop up in the state of Florida,"" campaign communications director Michael Tyler told reporters. ""It is one of many pathways that we have to 270 electoral votes, and we're going to take it very, very seriously.""<h2>Florida is rated as likely to go Republican in November</h2>At a fundraiser in Florida in January, Biden told donors, ""I think we can win Florida."" But it's a long shot. NPR's  new electoral college map analysis  rates Florida as likely to go Republican.Still, Biden's campaign is seizing an opportunity to draw a contrast with his Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, on an issue they expect will be decisive in 2024, pointing to polling data in key swing states indicating a strong majority of voters oppose restrictive abortion bans.In Tampa, Biden plans to ""forcefully advocate for reproductive freedom and call out Donald Trump's abortion bans, as he's been doing since  Roe  was overturned,"" Tyler told reporters. ""It's going to stand in stark contrast to Trump, who, when he's out on the stump every single day, is bragging about the role that he played in overturning  Roe .""Trump often boasts about his role in naming three Supreme Court justices who formed the majority on the court that overturned  Roe v. Wade .

"Barbara Sprunt,Lexie Schapitl,Deirdre Walsh","A third Republican House member has signed onto the effort to remove Mike Johnson as House speaker.""We need a Speaker who puts America first rather than bending to the reckless demands of the warmongers, neo-cons and the military industrial complex making billions from a costly and endless war half a world away,"" Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar said in a statement late Friday morning. Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene  filed the motion to vacate resolution  nearly a month ago, in part over disputes with the speaker on how he handled a  $1.2 trillion appropriations package . Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie co-sponsored that motion earlier this week.The trio of Republicans have expressed dismay that Johnson forged ahead with Ukraine aid without securing support for a bill aimed to strengthen security along the U.S.-Southern border. Gosar's announcement came shortly  after a House vote to advance foreign aid bills  to Ukraine, Taiwan and Israel, which required Democrats' support to offset GOP defections.With Gosar signing onto the effort to oust the speaker it means Johnson will likely need votes from Democrats if the resolution comes up for a vote. The GOP majority shrinks to a one-vote margin after Wisconsin GOP Rep. Mike Gallagher's resignation becomes official, which is expected after the House votes on the foreign aid package.Some Democrats have indicated they would help save Johnson if the motion to vacate comes to the floor. Rep. Bob Good, who chairs the House Freedom Caucus, said that although he disagrees with Johnson, he doesn't think it's in Republicans' interest to remove him as speaker. ""I don't defend the performance of the speaker, I don't defend the actions that have been taken,"" Good told reporters after the Friday vote. ""However, that doesn't mean that I support what I would consider to be not the most prudent action right now. We're six months before an election, we have a two-three vote margin.""Several members of the Republican conference had called for a Thursday rule to include changing the threshold to bring a motion to remove the speaker — which currently is just one member. Rep. Mike Lawler, a moderate Republican from a New York swing district, said Thursday the threshold should be changed ""immediately.""""However it needs to get done, it should get done,"" Lawler said. ""If Mike Johnson is removed simply because he put aid to our allies on the floor, No. 1, it'll cause another prolonged amount of chaos. And No. 2, it will make it that much harder for the next speaker to do the right thing at the right time.""But Johnson went on social media Thursday to say the House will ""continue to govern under the existing rules.""<h2>Democrats provide critical votes to advance GOP foreign aid package</h2>House Democrats played a key role in helping GOP leaders advance legislation to provide nearly $95 billion in stalled funding for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, teeing up a vote on final passage on Saturday.""Even though it's not the perfect legislation, it's not the legislation that we would write if Republicans were in charge of both the House, the Senate, and the White House, this is the best possible product that we can get under these circumstances,"" Johnson said after the vote. Democrats also took the extremely rare step of voting to advance the Republican foreign aid bills out of the Rules Committee late Thursday night. Republican Reps. Chip Roy, Thomas Massie and Ralph Norman voted against the rule in committee.Ahead of the vote, Democratic leaders had not committed to supporting the rule, as text was not yet available. But they said they were open to the possibility and they were committed to getting foreign aid passed.""We're going to do what's necessary to make sure that the national security bill gets over the finish line,"" House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Thursday morning. Minority support of a majority rule virtually never happens. As a result, Johnson and his predecessor, former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, have seen several rules fail on the floor, largely over objections from the right flank of the party.",2024-04-19 21:21:00 PM EEST,NPR,3rd Republican joins motion to oust Mike Johnson as House speaker,https://www.npr.org/2024/04/19/1245557540/house-aid-bills-ukraine-israel-funding-democrats-johnson
Ximena Bustillo,"Just before 10 a.m. Monday, a jury of 18 every-day New Yorkers filed into the Manhattan courtroom where former President Donald Trump sat at the defense table.""Members of the jury, we are about to proceed with the outset of the trial of Donald J. Trump,"" pronounced Judge Juan Merchan. As Merchan began instructing the jury on their critical role over the next few weeks, Trump, the defendant, sat flanked by his legal team, occasionally looking down and slightly shifting in his chair.Trump faces 34 felony counts alleging that he falsified New York business records in order to conceal damaging information to influence the 2016 presidential election. Trump claims the trial itself is ""election interference"" because of how it is disrupting his 2024 bid for president. He has pleaded not guilty and instead argues that all he did was pay his lawyer. Merchan told the jurors that the burden of proof will be on the prosecutors, who must prove that Trump is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Last week,  12 jurors and six alternates  were selected to decide the fate of the former president. The trial has begun about a year after a grand jury originally  delivered the indictment  that set up this trial as  the first against a sitting or former U.S. president .Jurors also began to hear from the first witness: David Pecker, former CEO of American Media, the publishing company of the  National Enquirer  magazine. Pecker, who was on the stand for less than a half hour before the first day wrapped at around lunchtime, testified to the editorial structure of his magazine and about the level of oversight he had on the stories. He also confirmed his phone numbers, which the prosecution suggested could be relevant later on.Testimony should continue on Tuesday. Other witnesses for the prosecution are expected are former Trump fixer Michael Cohen and Keith Davidson, a former lawyer for a  Playboy  model.<h2>The prosecution delivers a lengthy detail of the alleged scheme</h2>Prosecutor Matthew Colangelo delivered the opening statement on behalf of the district attorney's team, detailing that this case is about ""criminal conspiracy and coverup.""He laid out what has long been Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's argument: He alleges there was a conspiracy created in part by Trump to conceal information that he had an affair with an adult film star out of fear that if that information got out, it could hurt his 2016 presidential electoral prospects. There were 34 ""falsified"" business records, Colangelo said, while detailing how the DA's office believes Trump coordinated with Cohen, his former fixer, and Pecker in August 2015. This resulted in Trump's oversight of various flattering stories about him, he said, and also of damaging information about his opponents. Colangelo said that this deal made in August also resulted in a ""catch and kill"" scheme to find these potentially damaging stories as Election Day got closer and make sure they were never released. He said Pecker found potentially damaging info and ""killed it"" by paying people off. First was  Playboy  Playmate Karen McDougal, who was going to allege publicly she had an affair with Trump. Trump ""desperately"" did not want this made public, Colangelo told the jury. The former president has denied having an affair with McDougal.Three months before Election Day, a payment to McDougal was made, Colangelo said, with the help of Davidson, her lawyer. He also told the jury that they plan to play a recording of a phone call between Trump and Cohen about how to pay off Pecker and get the rights for the McDougal story.Further laying out the timeline, Colangelo noted the  Access Hollywood tape  was released a month before the election. ""The campaign went into immediate damage control mode,"" Colangelo said, adding that Trump received word the next day that another woman was about to come forward with her own alleged sexual encounter with the GOP nominee — adult film star Stormy Daniels. Trump has also denied this encounter.A story of infidelity with a porn star would have been damaging to the campaign, Colangelo said, and Trump wanted to ""prevent American voters from learning about that information before Election Day.""Cohen created a shell company to send $130,000 payment to Daniels, made at Trump's direction and for his benefit and with the specific goal of preventing negative information that could have cost Trump the election, Colangelo argued. ""It was election fraud. We will never know and it doesn't matter if this made the difference for him in the election,"" Colangelo said. ""You will see from social media posts, speeches at campaign rallies"" that Trump was worried about how this could ""hurt standing with voters and female voters in particular.""Colangelo foreshadowed that the jury will see text messages between the leadership of the  National Enquirer  questioning ""what have we done?"" They will also see how payments were calculated and disguised for tax purposes as well as evidence that ""Trump is a frugal businessman ... but when it came to pay Cohen back, he didn't negotiate the price down. He doubled it, so he could disguise it as income,"" Colangelo said.""There was no retainer agreement, it was instead what they thought was a clever way to pay Cohen back without being obvious about it,"" Colangelo said, detailing that Cohen submitted 11 ""phony invoices"" paid for by checks with ""false entries"" signed by Trump himself.Colangelo also attempted to get ahead of potential criticism of testimony of Cohen, noting that the defense is likely to discredit him. ""Cohen has made mistakes in the past,"" he said, adding that testimony also from Pecker and Davidson will corroborate what is said.""Tune out the noise. Focus on the fact,"" he closed.<h2>Defense sets up the argument: Trump did nothing illegal</h2>Trump, who largely seemed to look straight ahead or down during the prosecution's opening, turned to look at the jury when his lawyer stood at the lectern.""President Trump is innocent. Trump did not commit any crimes,"" said Todd Blanche. ""He is also a man, a husband, a father, and just like me.""Off the bat, Blanche told the jury that the story just detailed by the prosecution was not true and at the end of the trial there will be ""plenty of reasonable doubt.""Blanche argued that invoices, records and payments were made by the book in part because Cohen assumed the role of personal attorney when Trump entered the White House.He also argued that Trump was simply fighting back against allegations that could hurt his family, reputation and brand. ""There is nothing wrong with trying to influence an election. It's called democracy,"" he said.Blanche also spent time trying to discredit some of the prosecution's witnesses, primarily  Cohen, who has a history of perjury , and Daniels, also known as Stephanie Clifford, noting how she has received publicity,  pointing to her recent documentary , and how  Trump has won a defamation lawsuit against her . ""We are New Yorkers. It's why we are here,"" Blanche said, reminding the jury that they promised they would set aside personal thoughts of Trump from the past eight years. ""And if you do that, there will be a very swift not-guilty verdict.""",2024-04-22 20:19:00 PM EEST,NPR,First day of Trump's hush money trial kicks off with opening statements and a witness,https://www.npr.org/2024/04/22/1246321962/trump-hush-money
"Barbara Sprunt,Greg Myre,Deirdre Walsh","The Republican foreign aid package passed a key procedural hurdle in the House on Friday, after Democrats provided the necessary votes to offset dozens of GOP defections. The House voted 316-94 to advance aid bills to Israel, Taiwan and Ukraine, setting up a Saturday vote on final passage. In a rare occurrence, Democrats also stepped in Thursday night to help the majority party  advance the bills out of the rules committee . Three Republicans voted against the rule in committee — Reps. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, and Chip Roy of Texas. House Speaker Mike   Johnson's  proposal earlier this week to split up foreign aid into separate bills  caused pushback from members within his own party, who pointed to promises Johnson had made not to move forward with a Ukraine aid bill without a measure to strengthen security along the U.S. southern border. The foreign aid bills are similar to a $95 billion package that  passed in the Senate in February .Additionally, Johnson put forth a fourth bill aimed at implementing sanctions and policies to counter China, Iran and Russia. That was not part of the Senate version, but it may have momentum to go through alongside the foreign aid bills. President Biden said in a statement Wednesday that he supports the package. Here's a closer look at  what's in these bills .<h2>Increased aid to Israel</h2>There were renewed calls for lawmakers to take up aid to Israel after Iran launched an  unprecedented attack on Israel over the weekend . The House package would allocate $26.4 billion in aid for Israel to ""defend itself against Iran and its proxies, and to reimburse U.S. military operations in response to recent attacks.""The Senate-passed packaged designated $14 billion for Israel and $9 billion for humanitarian assistance in the region. The House bill lumps these together.Four billion dollars are designated to replenish  the Iron Dome  and David's Sling missile defense systems, with another $1.2 billion for the Iron Beam defense system. The bill also provides $2.4 billion for current U.S. military operations in response to recent attacks.The  House bill  provides weapons Israel says it needs in both the short term and well into the future. The measure would replenish the air defense interceptors that Israel has been using to shoot down some 15,000 rockets Hamas has fired out of Gaza over the past six months. That Hamas fire has all but ceased now that Israel's military controls most of Gaza. But Israel says it needs to be resupplied to guard against future attacks. This includes defense against the Lebanese group Hezbollah, which trades almost daily fire with Israel along their shared border. And in the most recent development, Israel, with help from the U.S. and others, shot down virtually all of the more than 300 weapons Iran launched in its weekend attack.Israel is also seeking advanced weapons, like fighter jets, that have to be built from scratch and would not arrive for several years.The bill prohibits funds to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). Israel has alleged that a dozen UNRWA staffers took part in Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7. UNRWA  said it was ""taking swift action""  after Israel presented it with evidence, and the Biden administration decided to pause funding for the agency. <h2>$60.8 billion for Ukraine aid</h2>Earlier this week, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner, R-Ohio, and Ranking Member Jim Himes, D-Conn., urged passage of Ukraine aid after receiving a classified briefing from the intelligence community and senior officials from the Departments of Defense and State.""We must pass Ukraine aid now,"" they said. ""The United States must stand against Putin's war of aggression now as Ukraine's situation on the ground is critical.""Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal told  All Things Considered  that U.S. aid is vital. ""During this six months without support from the U.S., the situation on the ground is difficult,"" he said. ""We have a lack of ammunition for artillery. We have a lack of middle- and long-range equipment, so this support is crucial for us.""The  bill for Ukraine  provides nearly $61 billion in assistance, in line with the measure the Senate passed. This would include two things Ukraine says it needs urgently — a resupply of artillery rounds and air defense missiles. Notably, the House version converts financial assistance to Ukraine's government, separate from military assistance, into a loan. The ground war in Ukraine has been largely an artillery duel, and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has spoken of Russia having a 10-1 advantage in artillery. In recent months, Russia has made limited gains on the ground. Zelenskyy and Ukrainian military officials say they have simply run out of ammunition in some cases and been forced to retreat. They say the problem could soon get even worse.Ukraine's air defense systems have been effective against Russian airstrikes for much of the past two years. But Russia has been carrying out more damaging strikes on Ukrainian cities and power plants in recent months. Ukraine says this also reflects a shortage of air defense missiles needed to shoot down the incoming Russian fire. The capital Kyiv and a few other critical places are well protected, but other parts of the country have limited air defenses at best.  The bill includes nearly $14 billion to help Ukraine buy advanced weapons systems and defense equipment, $13.4 billion to replenish U.S. defense stockpiles, $7.3 billion for current U.S. military operations in the region and $13.7 billion for purchasing U.S. defense systems for Ukraine. <h2>$8 billion for Indo-Pacific security</h2>The  bill for the Indo-Pacific  includes just over $8 billion to ""counter communist China and ensure a strong deterrence in the region.""Two billion dollars are allocated in foreign military financing for Taiwan, along with another $2 billion to replenish defense services provided to Taiwan and regional partners. The U.S. government has a legal obligation to provide Taiwan with arms to help defend itself, and sells the self-governed island billions of dollars worth of kit each year. Beijing objects to the assistance, claiming Taiwan to be a part of China that must eventually be unified politically with the mainland, by force if necessary. Over $3 billion is designated to develop submarine infrastructure. This provision is likely linked to the AUKUS security partnership launched three years ago by the U.S., Australia and the UK. As part of the partnership, the U.S. and UK pledged to help Australia acquire nuclear-powered submarines. While AUKUS doesn't openly take aim at China, analysts say the submarine element is a clear effort to counter Beijing's rapid naval expansion.<h2>Reupping previous House bill forcing TikTok to divest</h2>House GOP leaders added a fourth bill to the package that includes some sanctions against Russia, Iran, China, along with a measure to attempt to access  some of the Russian assets that were seized at the start of the war in Ukraine and use them to offset the costs of the additional aid. It also includes a House bill that passed overwhelmingly in March that forces TikTok to divest from its Chinese parent company ByteDance, or face a ban in the U.S.Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., and the top Republican on the panel, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, backed the House bill after it passed with a wide margin, 352-65, and pressed for the Senate to take up the issue. But a key committee chair, Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., expressed some concerns about the House version and raised the idea of holding a hearing. Lawmakers in both parties who backed the proposal also pushed to  declassify the intelligence  to help make their case. Proponents worried a delay, and the Senate's practice of moving much more slowly than the House, would mean the effort to enact any restrictions could slip away this year. TikTok and ByteDance ramped up spending on ads opposing the ban, spending millions in several states with key Senate races like Pennsylvania, Montana, Ohio and Nevada. The company argues any effort to force a sale violates the free speech rights of its 170 million U.S. users, and could damage small businesses who use the app, and content creators who rely on it to earn a living.But as GOP leaders crafted another national security measure to add to the foreign aid package, Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, who co-authored the House TikTok bill, told NPR that leaders from both parties in both chambers negotiated some changes to their bill to satisfy Senate issues. One was to extend the period that ByteDance would have to find a new buyer from six months in the House bill to one year. Cantwell endorsed the bill with that change, giving a big boost to the bill's prospects.""I'm very happy that Speaker Johnson and House leaders incorporated my recommendation to extend the Byte Dance divestment period from six months to a year,"" Cantwell said in a statement on Wednesday. ""As I've said, extending the divestment period is necessary to ensure there is enough time for a new buyer to get a deal done. I support this updated legislation.""Krishnamoorthi said he thought the change ""enhanced"" the bill and said he was ""optimistic"" this added bill to the foreign aid package would ultimately get through.

As the first criminal trial for a former U.S. president got under way in New York, Donald Trump looked on as prosecution and defense teams presented their opening statements to the jury.  The former president is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records, a felony in New York if done to cover up another crime.  The prosecution argued hush money payments made by former Trump fixer Michael Cohen to adult film star Stormy Daniels were to buy her silence about an alleged affair with Trump.  And were made at the former president's direction with the intention of influencing the 2016 election.   The defense countered it was not illegal to affect the outcome of an election and that Cohen had handled the specifics of the hush money payments.

Ximena Bustillo,"David Pecker, once the publisher of one of America's largest tabloids, testified on the witness stand Tuesday about his history and relationship with former President Donald Trump and how he manipulated coverage of the then-GOP candidate ahead of the 2016 election. Pecker is the former CEO of American Media Inc.,  which until 2019  was the publishing company of the  National Enquirer  magazine. He is now the first witness to testify against Trump, the presumptive 2024 GOP presidential nominee, in a trial accusing the former president of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records with the intent to further other crimes. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Pecker's testimony resumed Tuesday after a short time on the stand on Monday and lasted until mid-afternoon when jurors were dismissed for the day. The trial is set to pick back up on Thursday morning.As Trump watched from the defense table, Pecker detailed his history and relationship with the former president dating back to the '90s, how he first came to meet former Trump lawyer and potential other witness Michael Cohen, and his invitation to attend Trump's 2016 presidential bid announcement. Pecker testified to attending a mid-August 2015 meeting where Trump and Cohen asked him what he could do to help the campaign. Pecker agreed to ""run or publish positive stories about Mr. Trump and I would publish negative stories about his opponents. And I said, 'I will be your eyes and ears.' ""The  prosecution's opening statements  told the story of how they believe Pecker, Trump and Cohen conspired using a so-called ""catch and kill"" scheme in August 2015 to bury negative stories that could be damaging to Trump's 2016 electoral prospects and promote articles in the tabloid that were negative about his opponents. Pecker also testified he specifically promised to look out for potentially damaging stories from women. Recalling that process, Pecker discussed how he found out about key stories — such as the claim of an affair with  Playboy  model Karen McDougal — and that he'd had a private conversation with Trump about purchasing the story to avoid it being published. On Tuesday morning, just ahead of the second day of testimony, prosecutors asked Judge Juan Merchan  to fine Trump $10,000 for violating a gag order and rule Trump in contempt of court for 10 posts made on Truth Social, Trump's social media platform, and his campaign website. Weeks before the trial began, Merchan issued  a gag order  on Trump that specifically bars him from making or directing others to make public statements about potential jurors, court staff or family members of staff. A decision could come later Tuesday. <h2>Prosecutors set up Pecker's testimony on Monday</h2>Prosecutor Matthew Colangelo said in opening statements that the evidence will show that Pecker found potentially damaging info through his tabloid network and then reported back to Trump and Cohen.  This includes payments to McDougal, who was going to allege publicly she had an affair with Trump, and allegations of an affair by adult film star Stormy Daniels.Pecker's testimony could corroborate Cohen's, which the defense is already seeking to discredit. Pecker is also likely to testify about the plan for him to pay McDougal, which Trump did not reimburse him for. This sets up the context for Cohen paying Daniels, which the prosecutors argue happened because Pecker wouldn't pay a second time. Pecker also testified to the editorial structure of his magazine and about the level of oversight he had on the stories. He also confirmed his phone numbers, which the prosecution suggested could be relevant later on.In 2018, Pecker  was granted immunity in exchange  for providing federal prosecutors with information about the payments. American Media, Inc.  at the time admitted that it helped arrange payments  to McDougal and later was sold amid the  scandal of their involvement with the Trump campaign and federal investigations .Andrea Bernstein contributed to this report.",2024-04-23 21:44:00 PM EEST,NPR,Ex-National Enquirer publisher says he pledged to be Trump's 'eyes and ears',https://www.npr.org/2024/04/23/1246435476/david-pecker-trump-trial
Domenico Montanaro,"To better understand the landscape for the presidential election with a little more than six months to go, here is our initial Electoral Vote map of the cycle. It focuses on the states that are expected to be most competitive in the effort by the campaigns to get to 270 electoral votes, a majority of the 538 total available. There are a number of paths each candidate can take to victory.  Follow them here.This analysis, which will appear and be adjusted semi-regularly until Election Day, goes beyond just polling and is based on conversations with campaigns and strategists, NPR reporting from the field, campaign activity, and historical and demographic trends. It lays out which direction the states are leaning at this point and are organized into seven categories — Toss Up, Lean Republican, Lean Democratic, Likely Republican, Likely Democratic, Safe Republican and Safe Democratic.<h2>State analysis and ad spending</h2>Trump holds slight advantages in most of the swing states right now, according to averages of the polls. Strictly going by the polls, Trump would have a 283-255 lead (if you give Biden Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which are currently statistical ties). But the toss up states are expected to be close, within just a few points, in either candidate's direction. Biden currently has a massive war chest and ad-spending advantage. In addition to personnel, ads are the largest expenditure of a presidential campaign. <h2>Third-party scramble</h2>It's also unclear how third-party candidates could affect the map. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been pulling double digits in polling, and it's not totally clear which side he pulls most from. Polls have shown him pulling evenly, some have shown him pulling more from Trump, others more from Biden. The Biden campaign would prefer a one-on-one matchup with Trump and super PACs are cropping up on the left to attack Kennedy's record. He's qualified so far for the ballot in three states — Michigan, Hawaii and Utah. A  Quinnipiac poll  last month showed Trump's lead expanding from 3 to 5 points when RFK Jr. was included. Kennedy's campaign and a super PAC supporting him say he has enough signatures to potentially also get on ballots in Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Carolina and South Carolina.<h2>The state of play in the states</h2>In Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, Biden has caught up, pulled even or taken a lead in some recent surveys. And Pennsylvania happens to be where Biden and allies are spending the second-most on ads right now — almost $4 million in the past month and a half since Super Tuesday, the unofficial start to the general election. That's only slightly behind what they're spending in Michigan. Biden is trying to make up ground there with younger voters and Black voters, groups he's lagging with. Trump and groups supporting him have spent only about $700,000 in Pennsylvania in that same time frame.Team Biden has also spent $2 million in Wisconsin. Trump and groups supporting him have spent nothing there so far.Most of the money in this election is going to be poured into seven states, and they fall into two familiar buckets — the so-called ""Blue Wall"" states of  Michigan ,  Pennsylvania  and  Wisconsin  and the Sun Belt states of  Arizona ,  Georgia, North Carolina and Nevada .The Blue Wall states are home to significant shares of white, working-class voters, but Biden has retained strong support with unions. Democrats are also putting in significant efforts,  especially in Wisconsin , to reach Black voters and be on college campuses. All three states have significant Black populations and multiple colleges and universities. While North Carolina was also close in 2020 — within 2 points — given its history of voting Republican, it begins the cycle in the Lean Republican category. Democrats feel the gubernatorial race in the state could help them, as Republicans nominated a highly controversial candidate, who could turn off swing voters. The increasing population of white, college-educated voters in the state's Research Triangle continues to make the state competitive. But Republicans have won it in all but one presidential election since 1976. <h2>Demographics are important but it isn't everything</h2>The industrial Midwest has moved more toward Republicans because of the shift toward the GOP among white voters without college degrees. That's why states like Ohio and Iowa, which were competitive for decades until the Trump era, are no longer Democratic targets. It's the key group Trump is targeting. But they are declining as a share of the population and of the electorate. That's a big reason Trump lost despite whites without degrees voting at a higher rate in 2020 (64%) compared to 2016 (55%), according to data from Michael McDonald, the preeminent turnout expert in the country and professor at the University of Florida. It's also because of the continued shift with college-educated white voters toward Democrats. In 2020, Trump won college-educated white men by 3 points in 2020, according to exit polls, but the latest  NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll  showed Biden winning the group by more than 20 points. Combined with the increasing Latino and Asian American population and a remigration to the South of young Black voters, particularly in Georgia, that has meant a reshaping of the electoral map. ""In 2024, we'll see an even more diverse electorate than we saw in 2020, which was even more diverse than 2016 and more diverse than 2012,"" McDonald predicted.Consider that 20 years ago, Republican George W. Bush won Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Nevada, New Mexico and North Carolina. That's all changed, as each is either competitive or clearly in the Democratic column.In addition to the Latino population increase in the Southwest, McDonald pointed to the uptick in Asian Americans, and a remigration of Black voters to Georgia as to why those states continue to trend toward Democrats. But it's not all demographics. Latinos, Black voters and young voters all view the economy negatively. Majorities overall disapprove of Biden's handling of the economy and more voters say they think the economy was better under Trump.""Issues matter as well,"" McDonald noted. ""But the sort of issues that can move a sizable chunk of the electorate change with the demographics. And so that's where the two things intersect.""<h2>Post-pandemic election realities</h2>This year's election is also going to be different from 2020 in a very big way. Because of the pandemic, mail-in voting was used widely and that contributed heavily to increased turnout. In 2020, 66% of registered voters cast ballots,  the highest since 1900 . That's unlikely to be the case again, McDonald noted.""I would be very surprised if we have a turnout rate like we saw in 2020,"" McDonald said. ""And the people who would most likely then not participate ... are going to be these lower-education voters. And so it's going to pose a real challenge to the Trump campaign, to energize these folks yet again to vote in 2020.""<h2>Paths to 270</h2>As the map stands, if Trump and Biden win the states leaning in their direction, Trump would need to win 35 electoral votes from the toss ups to get to 270, and Biden would need 44.Here are three paths to get over the top for each candidate. <h2>For Trump:</h2><h2>For Biden:</h2><h2>But, there could also be a tie:</h2>There has only been one Electoral Vote tie in U.S. history — it happened in  the election of 1800 .The country came  thisclose  in 1876, and 2000 was within 5 electoral votes... and some hanging chads.If a tie happened, Trump would likely become president, because a tie would go to the House. Each House delegation would cast one collective vote for their states. The voting delegations would be those voted into the House after this year's congressional elections. Republicans currently  hold an advantage  and are still likely to do so in 2025 as well.Here are two potential, not outside the realm of possibility, tie scenarios:",2024-04-23 12:00:00 PM EEST,NPR,The states to watch on the 2024 electoral map,https://www.npr.org/2024/04/23/1246359499/2024-electoral-map

None,"JUNEAU, Alaska — The Biden administration said Friday it will restrict new oil and gas leasing on 13 million acres (5.3 million hectares) of a federal petroleum reserve in Alaska to help protect wildlife such as caribou and polar bears as the Arctic continues to warm.The decision — part of a yearslong fight over whether and how to develop the vast oil resources in the state — finalizes protections first proposed last year as the Democratic administration prepared to approve the contentious Willow oil project.The approval of Willow  drew fury from environmentalists, who said the large oil project violated President Joe Biden's pledge to combat climate change. Friday's decision also completes an earlier plan that called for closing nearly half the reserve to oil and gas leasing.A group of Republican lawmakers, led by Alaska U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, jumped out ahead of Friday's announcement about the new limitations in the National Petroleum-Reserve Alaska before it was publicly announced. Sullivan called it an ""illegal"" attack on the state's economic lifeblood, and he predicted lawsuits.""It's more than a one-two punch to Alaska,"" Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski said, ""because when you take off access to our resources, when you say you cannot drill, you cannot produce, you cannot explore, you cannot move it — this is the energy insecurity that we're talking about.""The decision by the Interior Department doesn't change the terms of existing leases in the reserve or affect currently authorized operations, including Willow.<h2>The administration also recommends rejecting an Alaska mining road project</h2>The Biden administration also Friday recommended the rejection of a state corporation's application related to a proposed 210-mile (338-kilometer) road in the northwest part of the state to allow mining of critical mineral deposits, including including copper, cobalt, zinc, silver and gold. There are no mining proposals or current mines in the area, and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management determined the road-building alternatives analyzed ""would significantly and irrevocably impact resources,"" the agency said in a statement. A final decision on the recommendation is pending.Brian Ridley, chief of Tanana Chiefs Conference, an Alaska Native nonprofit corporation, said the administration's ""choice to reject the Ambler Road Project is a monumental step forward in the fight for Indigenous rights and environmental justice."" The tribes of the Tanana Chiefs Conference had expressed concerns a road would harm their communities, land and wildlife.Sullivan accused the administration of undermining U.S. national security interests with both decisions. Alaska political leaders have long accused the administration of harming the state with decisions limiting the development of oil and gas, minerals and timber.""Joe Biden is fine with our adversaries producing energy and dominating the world's critical minerals while shutting down our own in America, as long as the far-left radicals he feels are key to his reelection are satisfied,'' Sullivan said Thursday at a Capitol news conference with 10 other GOP senators. ""What a dangerous world this president has created.""Biden defended his decision regarding the petroleum reserve.Alaska's ""majestic and rugged lands and waters are among the most remarkable and healthy landscapes in the world,"" are critical to Alaska Native communities and ""demand our protection,"" he said in a statement.Nagruk Harcharek, president of Voice of the Arctic Iñupiat, a group whose members include leaders from across much of Alaska's North Slope region, in a statement said the decision ""does not reflect our communities' wishes."" The group's board of directors previously passed a resolution opposing the administration's plans for the reserve, and Harcharek expressed frustrations that local leaders were not consulted before details of the administration's proposal were released last September.""From our perspective, essentially what you're doing is you're taking the economic potential and shrinking it to a point where, we don't know,"" he said in an interview regarding Friday's announcement. ""There's a lot of unknowns associated with that.""<h2>Oil industry calls reserve decision a ""step in the wrong direction""</h2>The American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry's top lobbying group, called the rule ""misguided'' and said it sharply limits future oil and natural gas development in the petroleum reserve, ""a region explicitly intended by Congress to bolster America's energy security'' and generate revenue for Alaskan communities.""At a time when the world is looking for American energy leadership, this is yet another step in the wrong direction,"" said Dustin Meyer, an API senior vice president.The petroleum reserve, about 100 miles (161 kilometers) west of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, is home to caribou and polar bears and provides habitat for millions of migrating birds. It was set aside around a century ago as an emergency oil source for the U.S. Navy, but since the 1970s it has been overseen by the Interior Department. There has been ongoing, longstanding debate over where oil and gas development should occur.Most existing leases in the petroleum reserve are clustered in an area that's considered to have high development potential, according to the Bureau of Land Management, which falls under the Interior Department. The development potential in other parts of the reserve is lower, the agency said.The rules announced Friday would place restrictions on future leasing and industrial development in areas designated as special for their wildlife, subsistence or other values and call for the agency to evaluate regularly whether to designate new special areas or bolster protections in those areas. The agency cited as a rationale the rapidly changing conditions in the Arctic due to climate change, including melting permafrost and changes in plant life and wildlife corridors.ConocoPhillips Alaska, which has leases and projects in the petroleum reserve, including Willow, is reviewing the decision ""to determine its scope and effect,"" according to a company statement.<h2>Environmentalists cheer the decision</h2>Environmentalists were elated by Friday's decision.""The Biden administration's actions for America's Arctic shows a commitment to conservation that meets the needs of the region's outsized vastness and ecological value,"" said Kristen Miller, executive director at Alaska Wilderness League. ""Our nation's public lands are an essential part of addressing the climate and biodiversity crisis, and this decision could not come at a more critical time.""Activist Bill McKibben called the decision a ""massive win,″ adding: ""We lost the fight over Willow, but the huge outcry meant that some real good came of that debacle.″Jeremy Lieb, an attorney with Earthjustice, called the decision an important step but urged ""even bolder action to keep the fossil fuel industry out of the Arctic, for the sake of the climate and future generations."" Earthjustice is involved in litigation currently before a federal appeals court that seeks to overturn Willow's approval.A decision in that case is pending.",2024-04-20 15:55:00 PM EEST,NPR,Biden administration restricts oil and gas leasing in Alaska's petroleum reserve,https://www.npr.org/2024/04/20/1246085825/biden-restricts-alaska-oil-gas-leasing-reserve
Barbara Sprunt,"The House of Representatives has voted to pass a $95 billion foreign aid package that includes funding to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. Each portion of the package — which was broken down into separate bills — received bipartisan support. A majority of Republican members — 112 — voted against aid to Ukraine, with one member voting ""present."" Thirty-seven Democrats voted against aid to Israel. The package contains a fourth bill aimed at implementing sanctions and policies to counter China, Iran and Russia. It also includes a version of a House bill that passed overwhelmingly in March that  forces TikTok to divest from its Chinese parent company  or face a ban in the U.S. In a statement Saturday, President Biden thanked lawmakers for coming together to pass the funding for U.S. allies that he has been pushing for months. ""It comes at a moment of grave urgency, with Israel facing unprecedented attacks from Iran, and Ukraine under continued bombardment from Russia,"" Biden said. The president urged the Senate to quickly send it to his desk for signature.  <h2>How the funding finally passed</h2>The House-passed bills are similar to a $95 billion package that  passed the Senate in February  but then stalled in the House. The White House and congressional Democrats had urged Speaker Mike Johnson to hold a vote on that Senate package in the wake of  Iran's recent unprecedented attack on Israel , and amid briefings that Ukraine is in dire need of U.S. aid.But aid for Ukraine remains deeply unpopular with large portions of Johnson's conference, who argue the House shouldn't provide further funding without strengthening security at the U.S.-Mexico border. Johnson announced earlier this week that he would break up foreign aid into distinct bills so his members could vote their conscience on each piece. ""Our process, in the end, ensured that each member was able to consider the individual supplemental elements on their own merits, which is exactly how the House is supposed to work,"" Johnson said after the vote on Saturday afternoon. ""I know there are critics of the legislation. I understand that — it is not a perfect piece of legislation. We're not ensured that in a time of divided government.""Ahead of the vote, Rep. Michael McCaul, who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, said, ""History will judge us by our actions here today."" ""The world is watching. Our adversaries are watching,"" the Texas Republican said. Take a closer look at what's inside the House foreign aid package.    <h2>Eyes on potential motion to vacate vote</h2>There was speculation that Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene would trigger a motion to vacate the speaker after Saturday's vote. Greene first  filed the motion to vacate resolution  a month ago, in part over frustration with the speaker on how he handled a  $1.2 trillion spending package . On Friday, a  third Republican member signed onto the effort  to remove Johnson as speaker. But Greene told reporters after the Saturday vote she wants ""to let my colleagues go home and hear from their constituents.""""I've said from the beginning I'm going to be responsible with this,"" Greene said. ""I'm handling this the right way. I'm allowing the process to happen.""She called Johnson a lame-duck speaker. ""If we had the vote today in our conference, he would not be speaker.""House Freedom Caucus chair Bob Good, R-Va., told reporters on Friday that although he doesn't defend Johnson's performance as speaker, he thinks it's not in the interest of the Republican Party to go through another speakership fight six months before an election. ""I hope they will not move forward with that,"" he said of the GOP trio that is sponsoring the motion to vacate resolution. ""I think we ought to have a contest in November, a deliberative process to select, hopefully, the speaker of the House majority. But I don't think it'd be a wise course of action to do that now.""",2024-04-20 22:18:00 PM EEST,NPR,"House passes foreign aid bills to Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan",https://www.npr.org/2024/04/20/1245993370/house-ukraine-israel-aid-bills
"Andrea Hsu,Stephan Bisaha","Workers at the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., have voted overwhelmingly to join the United Auto Workers, setting a new trajectory for labor unions in the American South.With 3,613 ballots counted, the final tally was 2,628 votes in favor of joining the UAW, and 985 votes against. Some 73% of workers voted in favor of unionizing.The UAW pulled off the resounding victory after two prior defeats in a region deeply skeptical of unions and despite repeated warnings from state Republican leaders and the business community that unionizing would be a big mistake.From early in the count, it was clear that the UAW had won many workers over. Yes votes quickly began outnumbering no votes by about 3 to 1, a lead that held throughout the night.Quinton North, who assembles battery packs for the Volkswagen ID.4 electric SUV, voted no in the last union election at Volkswagen in 2019, swayed by pervasive anti-union messaging in that campaign.This time, North voted yes, citing the leadership of UAW president Shawn Fain as a big reason.""He's really showed what he is — he's for the workers,"" he said at a UAW-organized watch party in Chattanooga.Addressing the watch party crowd after the tally was complete, Fain welcomed the Volkswagen workers into the UAW and thanked them for their perseverance.""You all have just done the most important thing a working class person can do, and that's stand up,"" he said to loud cheering.Some 4,300 hourly workers at the plant were eligible to vote this week. The union needed a simple majority of votes cast to win the election. Noting voter turnout of 83.5%, the German automaker issued a short statement saying: ""Volkswagen thanks its Chattanooga workers for voting in this election.""<h2>Chattanooga plant was previously a place of UAW defeat</h2>All eyes were on the Volkswagen vote, given two previous defeats for the  UAW's attempt to organize the same Chattanooga plant  in 2014 and 2019. Similar efforts at several other auto manufacturing plants in the South have also failed over the years.One of the key reasons is that these jobs have paid well compared to others in the region, and many workers haven't felt the need for union representation. In fact, over the years, Southern states lured foreign automakers with not just hundreds of millions of dollars in incentives but some assurance that the companies wouldn't have to deal with the UAW if they didn't want to.The pitch worked. In the last three decades or so, around a dozen foreign auto plants have opened up, from Nissan and Toyota to Honda and Mercedes, among others. Collectively, they've created tens of thousands of jobs for the Southern economy.<h2>Politicians warned jobs were in jeopardy</h2>Republican leaders in the state had warned that those jobs could be lost should workers join the UAW.""I believe it would be a big mistake for those workers to risk their future by giving up the freedom to decide it themselves and hand that over to a negotiator on their behalf,"" said Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee on a visit to Chattanooga earlier this month.The UAW's focus on the South, backed by $40 million in spending, has drawn concern from other state politicians as well. On Tuesday, Lee joined governors from Texas, South Carolina, Mississippi, Georgia and Alabama in a joint statement speaking out against the union drive.""The reality is companies have a choice when it comes to where to invest and bring jobs and opportunity,"" the statement said. ""Unionization would certainly put our states' jobs in jeopardy — in fact, in this year already, all of the UAW automakers have announced layoffs.""Tesla, which is not unionized, also announced major layoffs this week.In a statement congratulating the Volkswagen workers on their ""historic vote,"" President Biden took aim at the politicians.""Let me be clear to the Republican governors that tried to undermine this vote: there is nothing to fear from American workers using their voice and their legal right to form a union if they so choose,"" he wrote.<h2>It was the only VW plant in the world without worker representation</h2>In a Q&A on its website, Volkswagen wrote: ""We respect our employees' right to decide this important issue through a democratic process and to determine who should represent their interests.""Assembly worker Joshua Treece, who voted yes, said the company seemed pretty neutral as the election neared.""The only negative stuff would have been from other employees that were against it,"" he says.The Chattanooga plant produces Volkswagen's Atlas SUV and the ID.4, an electric SUV. Until now, it was the only Volkswagen plant worldwide without worker representation.With the vote at Volkswagen now wrapped up, the union is turning its attention to the Mercedes-Benz plant in Vance, Ala., where a union election will begin May 13 for some 5,200 workers.",2024-04-20 06:48:00 AM EEST,NPR,"Volkswagen workers vote yes to unionizing, igniting UAW's push to organize the South",https://www.npr.org/2024/04/19/1244291402/volkswagen-union-election-ballot-tally-united-auto-workers
Bobby Allyn,"TikTok is now hurtling toward what is perhaps its biggest threat yet in the U.S. The House on Saturday passed legislation that could trigger a nationwide ban of TikTok if its Chinese owner does not sell the video app.  The Senate could vote on the bill as soon as Tuesday.While lawmakers in the House  advanced a similar bill  last month, this effort is different for two reasons: It is attached to a sweeping foreign aid bill providing support for Ukraine and Israel. And it addresses concerns from some members of the Senate by extending the deadline for TikTok to find a buyer.President Biden supports the effort. That means TikTok being forced to sell, or face a possible ban, is on the fast-track to becoming law. It would mark the first time ever the U.S. government has passed a law that could shut down an entire social media platform, setting the stage for what is expected to be a protracted legal battle.  TikTok condemned the bill as an unconstitutional attack against the hugely popular service. ""It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans,"" said TikTok spokesman Alex Haurek.  <h2>Fears over propaganda, spying, fuel TikTok crackdown</h2>National security officials in Washington have feared that the Chinese government could use TikTok to promote propaganda aimed at interfering in U.S. elections, or surveil some of the 170 million Americans who use the app every month. Those concerns remain largely hypothetical. TikTok is owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance, yet there is no publicly available evidence that government officials have ever influenced what Americans see on the app, nor any proof that officials in China have spied on U.S. citizens through TikTok. TikTok says it has built a firewall between its headquarters in Los Angeles and its parent company in Beijing, but  some   reports  indicate U.S. user data does still move between the two. While there has been no evidence made public that Chinese government officials have accessed Americans' information through TikTok, the idea that China has the theoretical ability to weaponize an app used by half of America has been enough to set off an all-out crackdown.  <h2>Questions about exactly what a buyer would be getting</h2>Under the bill just passed by the House, TikTok would be given up to a year to find a company, or group of investors, to acquire it. That extends the timeline from the six-month window the app was given in the original bill the House passed last month, which some Senators said was too short. But that has raised a critical question among TikTok experts: What exactly would they be buying? TikTok's algorithm, the secret sauce of the app, is owned by ByteDance. And during the Trump administration's campaign against TikTok, China  added  content-recommendation algorithms to its export-control list, meaning selling the technology would require the blessing of the Chinese government. James Lewis, director of the technology and public-policy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that is a non-starter for Beijing. ""The Chinese said very firmly this month at senior levels that they won't let the algorithm be sold and without it, it's an empty deal,"" Lewis told NPR. Then there is the hurdle of the pricetag itself. Given that TikTok is one of the largest and most popular social media platforms in the world, its value would put it out of reach for all but the largest tech companies. It's not known exactly how much TikTok is worth, but analysts peg its privately-owned parent company, ByteDance, at around $225 billion. TikTok is by far the company's most successful service. If a Silicon Valley giant attempted to take over TikTok, that would almost certainly attract scrutiny from antitrust enforcers in Washington, who have grown increasingly skeptical of deals that increase the reach of already-massive tech firms. Lewis, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, is doubtful the latest push will result in ByteDance letting go of TikTok. But, he noted, it does forestall the issue until after the November presidential election:  ""The bill buys time to figure out a real solution, while putting space between passage and the election.""

Sydney Lupkin,"Pharmaceutical company reps have been visiting doctors for decades to tell them about the latest drugs. But how does the practice affect patients? A group of economists tried to answer that question.When drug company reps visit doctors, it usually includes lunch or dinner and a conversation about a new drug. These direct-to-physician marketing interactions are tracked as payments in a public database, and a new study shows the meetings work. That is, doctors prescribe about five percent more oncology drugs following a visit from a pharmaceutical representative, according to the  new study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research this month.   But the researchers also found that the practice doesn't make cancer patients live longer.""It does not seem that this payment induces physicians to switch to drugs with a mortality benefit relative to the drug the patient would have gotten otherwise,"" says  study author Colleen Carey , an assistant professor of economics and public policy at Cornell University.For their research, she and her colleagues used Medicare claims data and the  Open Payments database , which tracks drug company payments to doctors. While the patients being prescribed these new cancer drugs didn't live longer, Carey also points out that they didn't live shorter lives either. It was about equal.The pharmaceutical industry trade group, which is known as PhRMA, has a code of conduct for how sales reps should interact with doctors. The code was most recently updated in 2022, says  Jocelyn Ulrich, the group's vice president of policy and research .""We're ensuring that there is a constant attention from the industry and ensuring that these are very meaningful and important interactions and that they're compliant,"" she explains.The code says that if drug reps are buying doctors a meal, it must be modest and can't be part of an entertainment or recreational event. The goal should be education.Ulrich also points out that cancer deaths in the U.S.  have declined by 33 percent since the 1990s , and new medicines are a part of that.

Huo Jingnan,"Tesla has slashed prices for its electric vehicles in the United States, China and other countries, comparisons of its websites late Friday and over the weekend show.In the U.S., the company reduced the starting prices of its Model X, Model Y and Model S by $2,000, which is a drop of less than 5% for the most affordable model. Prices for Model 3 and Cybertruck remained the same. In China, Tesla dropped prices for all of its models on sale there for 14,000 yuan, or just over 5% for the most affordable model. China is Tesla's largest market outside of the United States and accounts for over a fifth of its revenue, according to the company's  latest annual report .The company also lowered the starting prices of most of its cars in Germany. A Tesla spokesperson told the  Guardian  and  Reuters  that there were price cuts in many other countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.The news comes as Tesla has delivered fewer cars in the last quarter than the same quarter a year before - something that has not happened in four years. The company is expected to announce its first quarter earnings this coming Tuesday. Previously, its owner Elon Musk has spoken of competition, especially more affordable EVs models made by Chinese companies.Tesla announced recalls  for Cybertruck on Friday due to safety issues related to its accelerator pedal. The electric vehicle manufacturer  laid off 10% of its staff  on Tuesday. The company's stock price has fallen back to where it was a year ago.

Julia Simon,"SAN JOSE, Calif. —  One morning late last year, an RV pulled into a parking lot on the outskirts of Silicon Valley. Inside it was a blue Ikea bag with huge balloons, and metal tanks full of helium and sulfur dioxide gas. The mission was led by Luke Iseman, a 41-year-old serial entrepreneur with a mohawk hairstyle and an orange t-shirt that read ""Cool Earth."" Inspired by a science fiction novel, Iseman had founded a company in 2022 called Make Sunsets.  In the novel , a billionaire undertakes a type of ""solar geoengineering"": shooting vast amounts of reflective particles high into the atmosphere to reflect sunlight off Earth and counter global warming. Now, Iseman was trying to do it in the real world. Iseman took a wrench and opened the tanks, releasing the sulfur dioxide first and then the helium. He siphoned the gasses into a long tube while his business partner, Andrew Song, stood just outside the RV using the tube to inflate a weather balloon. As the balloon grew to about 6 feet wide, some sulfur dioxide – which can be hazardous to human health in high concentrations – started to leak. I began to cough, and my eyes watered. ""Don't take big whiffs of air,"" Song said.""Just don't breathe,"" Iseman said with a laugh.The three balloons that  Make Sunsets  launched that day made it to the stratosphere – a layer of the atmosphere about six to 30 miles above Earth's surface. When the balloons popped, the sulfur dioxide gas turned to particles– reflecting enough sunlight, the company says, to offset the warming of 175 gas-powered cars for a year. But Make Sunsets and its balloons signal something bigger: a growing number of startups, research projects, and billionaire-backed nonprofits hoping to ready this tech to potentially cool the earth on a wider scale. In the past year, the conversation around solar geoengineering as a climate solution has become more serious, says David Keith, geophysics professor and head of  a new University of Chicago initiative  to study a broad array of climate geoengineering ideas. ""Suddenly we're getting conversations with senior political leaders and senior people in the environmental world who are starting to think about this and engage with it seriously in a way that just wasn't happening five years ago,"" Keith says.But as money flows in – some from investors who hope to profit from this technology – regulations around outdoor experiments and possible broader deployments aren't keeping up, experts say. Because of the way the stratosphere works, a large-scale release of particles in one part of the world could impact a large part of the planet. Questions persist about possible risks of solar geoengineering for everything from global crops to droughts. And there are risks of unintended consequences that scientists and investors haven't yet imagined – the unknown unknowns of trying to engineer a cooler Earth.Shuchi Talati, founder and executive director of the nonprofit  The Alliance for Just Deliberation on Solar Geoengineering , says Make Sunsets' actions crystallize the need for urgent regulation of this tech.""At some point down the road, they're going to do this at a big enough scale to trigger some sort of climate impact,"" Talati says. ""It can be done in an effective, globally governed way, or it can be done by two crazy people in California, and it can look horrible for a lot of people.""<h2>""The allure of the techno fix""</h2>Iseman, a former director at  a tech incubator  who used to build  large art projects  at Burning Man festival, acknowledges there's a performative aspect to his work. For his company to have a measurable cooling impact, researchers say it would need to release significantly more material, probably require equipping special planes, and is likely  years away . But Make Sunsets is attracting significant Silicon Valley investment, and is hoping to have that bigger impact. The company has raised more than $1.2 million from venture capital firms like Boost VC, Pioneer Fund, and Draper Associates. It's unclear how many entities are exploring solar geoengineering, because some projects keep their work under wraps. But Make Sunsets isn't alone.A U.S.-Israeli startup called  Stardust Solutions  that plans to someday launch reflective particles into the stratosphere has raised $15 million, according to its chief executive officer and co-founder, Yanai Yedvab. Stardust's investors include  SolarEdge , an Israeli green energy company, and  Awz Ventures , an Israeli-Canadian venture capital fund that  highlights  on its website a partnership with  Israel's Ministry of Defense . From  sucking carbon dioxide out of the sky  to giant sun-reflecting space mirrors, geoengineering the planet to avoid the worst impacts of global warming is capturing the imagination of greater numbers of people. Coming out of  the hottest year on record , with governments and industries failing to adequately transition away from fossil fuels, some people are looking for silver bullets. This attraction is especially felt in Silicon Valley, says  Gernot Wagner , a climate economist at Columbia Business School.""Climate tech is sexy,"" Wagner says, ""because it's the allure of the techno fix. Look to D.C., and things are messy. Politics is messy. Wouldn't it be nice if we could cut through all of this with the ultimate techno fix that will solve this thing once and for all?""Iseman says he's motivated by an urgency to act on climate change.  World governments agreed  to keep global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2100. But temperatures have already risen about 1.2 degrees Celsius, and  many scientists think the world will blow past 1.5 Celsius . Passing it would mean more catastrophic impacts like lethal heat waves and flooding, coral die-offs and melting ice. ""What we have done has not worked,"" Iseman says about current efforts to address global warming. ""And we need to try many more broad approaches."" Iseman and other solar geoengineering advocates reject the idea of a so-called ""moral hazard"" with this technology. That's the idea that solar geoengineering will distract from the difficult - and scientifically necessary - work of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and will give fossil fuel polluters continued license to pollute.""I think we need to do solar geoengineering – hard stop – because the world is too hot. We need to cool it off,"" Iseman says. ""I wouldn't say we should only do that after we start dropping global greenhouse [gas] emissions. 'Cause, frankly, I don't know when we're gonna do that.""Make Sunsets does not employ any scientists. The employees are just Iseman and Song, who met while Iseman worked at a tech incubator and  Song  worked as an outreach manager at a crowdfunding website. Iseman says if they scale up the company, they'll hire scientists.Stardust's team includes 20 scientists and engineers, including chemists, aviation experts, and physicists, like the company's CEO, Yedvab. Yedvab wrote in an email that he started looking into the tech two and a half years ago and found that it ""is the sole viable option humanity has to stop global warming in the coming decades.""Stardust notes their focus is research in anticipation of future government contracts for deployment. But there is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding the science, and experts worry it's too dangerous for companies to have a financial motive to develop and deploy this tech on a larger scale, when there still isn't clear regulation.""We do know it will reduce global temperatures. That is the one thing we know,"" Talati says. ""We don't know almost everything else.""<h2>From droughts to ""termination shock,"" the technology poses risks</h2>The type of solar geoengineering Make Sunsets works on is often called ""stratospheric aerosol injection,"" and much of what's known about how it could work comes from volcanoes. When Mount Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines in 1991, sulfur dioxide from the eruption spread across the global stratosphere. The particles ended up  cooling the world about half a degree Celsius  the following year.Scientists predict the world would, on average, get cooler with this type of solar geoengineering. Compared to other climate tech,  it's also very cheap , and – once operational – could have a rapid cooling impact. But there are lots of unpredictable risks. Computer modeling has limits, says  Jonas Jägermeyr , who models impacts of solar geoengineering on global crops at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. ""It is difficult to know what we are getting ourselves into unless we actually did the experiment on the whole planet,"" he wrote in an email.If the world engages in stratospheric aerosol injection, it wouldn't go back to some pre-global warming climate, says  Alan Robock , climate scientist at Rutgers University. This type of solar geoengineering could weaken the summer monsoon, meaning some regions – where billions of people live – would see less rain. And it could end up changing the ozone layer and ultraviolet radiation, which could affect crop growth and global food supplies,  Jägermeyr  says.Changing temperatures and rainfall patterns could mean new risks for infectious diseases, says  Christopher Trisos , chief research officer in the Climate Risk Lab at the University of Cape Town. ​​""Solar geoengineering could shift the population at risk by  nearly a billion people  for malaria across developing countries,"" Trisos says. Then there's ""termination shock,"" which is what it sounds like: the shock of suddenly halting a huge experiment. After injecting particles into the stratosphere, the particles only stay there for a year or two and then fall back to earth. Depending on the material, those falling particles can sometimes create their own environmental and health risks.Because the particles don't stay up forever, if the world doesn't simultaneously reduce the amount of planet-heating gasses in the atmosphere while doing large-scale solar geoengineering, suddenly stopping the experiment poses a big risk. ""You get a whole rush of global warming and climate change in a very short period of time,"" Trisos says. ""That would be very dangerous for ecosystems, for biodiversity, in many cases, very dangerous for crops and food supplies as well.""<h2>New companies raise fears of regulatory gaps</h2>A growing number of legal scholars say national and international regulations are inadequate to cover potential large-scale deployments of solar geoengineering. As global warming gets worse, ""there's going to be a strong desire by someone somewhere to do something,"" says  Tracy Hester , a law professor at University of Houston who studies climate geoengineering. ""There will be a temptation to grab the throttle and push ahead."" Hester worries that right now there's no regulatory strategy if that happens: ""We need to know what we're doing. The consequences here are pretty massive."" In the U.S., the interactions Make Sunsets has with U.S. government agencies are minimal. Before each balloon launch, Iseman calls up the Federal Aviation Administration and  alerts them  that he'll be launching weather balloons. Iseman also files  a yearly report  with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) listing all of the company's ""weather modification activities"". In one NOAA report in the box marked ""project or activity designation,"" Iseman wrote: ""Cooling Earth."" While Make Sunsets was launching balloons in the parking lot, on the edge of a  county park , a park ranger drove up to us, got out of the car, asked Iseman and Song a few questions about the balloons, and drove away after less than three minutes.Iseman spends much of his time in Baja California, and the company has done a number of experiments in Mexico. Last year  the Mexican government released a statement  saying that they would ban solar geoengineering in their national territory, referencing the activities of Make Sunsets.But outside of Mexico, things are unclear. There are no international conventions that specifically deal with this type of technology, Hester says. The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity –  a treaty that protects wildlife  – has a moratorium on geoengineering that affects living species. But the moratorium is guidance, and non-binding. And ""the U.S. is actually not a party"" to the treaty, says  Daniel Bodansky , a climate legal expert and law professor at Arizona State University.The Montreal Protocol, a treaty to address ozone depletion, could potentially cover the ways that stratospheric aerosol injection affects ozone. But that treaty does not currently address all the impacts of the tech, nor does it cover all types of solar geoengineering, Bodansky says. Last month Hester, Talati and others filed  a petition to NOAA . They asked the federal agency to consider making a rule requiring solar geoengineering companies like Make Sunsets to file more information about what they're doing, and consider regulating American citizens when they do solar geoengineering internationally. A NOAA spokesperson wrote in an email, ""We are currently reviewing the request for rulemaking and will provide a response to the petitioners."" Stardust is doing outdoor small-scale testing ""only to the extent required ... and in full compliance with all relevant regulations,"" Yedvab wrote.Yedvab, who used to work for Israel's atomic energy commission, adds: ""Decision making regarding whether to deploy [stratospheric aerosol injection], when and to what extent should only be taken by governments.""A White House official wrote in an email that solar geoengineering activities in the U.S. must comply with applicable local, state, and federal laws. The email notes that new tech ""may present unforeseen circumstances that require new guidance and/or governance mechanisms."" The official did not clarify what that new guidance or governance might look like.Iseman of Make Sunsets says, ""I think regulations have to be holistic to be meaningful, or people, including me, will just game them.""<h2>A test on San Francisco Bay</h2>As the private sector grows, not-for-profit entities are speeding up their research. Earlier this month, a handful of scientists and engineers gathered on deck of a decommissioned aircraft carrier on the San Francisco Bay to test a large machine. After about a decade of work, the researchers were readying the machine for one of its first tests outdoors, creating tiny salt water particles that could – someday – reflect sunlight and cool earth.An engineer scooped salt into a large plastic container, mixing it with water. Then he turned the machine on, letting forth a giant hissing spray of salt water particles down the aircraft runway.The test represents a different type of solar geoengineering than Make Sunsets' balloons. ""Marine cloud brightening"" involves brightening ocean clouds to reflect more planet-heating sunlight. This technology could someday significantly reduce many of the impacts of global warming, says  Sarah Doherty , a University of Washington professor who manages this program. But it also has risks. If the particles are too big, they can make the clouds  less  reflective, and actually  warm  the planet. An imbalance of cloud brightening off West Africa could cause a drought in the Amazon. For Doherty, these unknowns are a big reason for this research.""You could see in 20 years from now, people saying, 'Oh my God, we're really in trouble. We've got major climate disruption. Let's do this thing that we know exists.' Well, if we haven't done the research to look at the ways to not do it properly, to not do it in a way that's going to cause more damage, then we're really in trouble,"" she says.The risks are why university researchers, not for-profit companies, should guide studies of this tech, argues Kelly Wanser, executive director of  SilverLining , the nonprofit that led fundraising for Doherty's program. The University of Washington program – which  also aims to improve current climate modeling  – has raised $16 million, mostly from  philanthropic climate funds  and Silicon Valley scientists. Doherty says there's no strings attached. ""They're not gonna ever get anything back out of it other than more science,"" she says.Wanser contrasts this with what she calls the ""misaligned incentives"" of private companies entering the space. In addition to its venture capital fundraising, Make Sunsets sells ""cooling credits"" –   a single $10 credit  offsets the warming of 1 metric ton of carbon dioxide, the company says. For Wanser, for-profit companies like Make Sunsets have a monetary incentive to keep releasing balloons, even if the effects could be harmful.Iseman responds in an email that, ""All change is scary, and we can't use 'someday maybe' as an excuse to avoid the bold actions that the climate crisis demands.""But even with university-based solar geoengineering research, there's a need for regulation, says Imran Khalid, a climate policy researcher based in Islamabad. While the aircraft carrier is  a museum open to the public  – a group of elementary school children came aboard a little while after the test – there are no rules requiring future research projects to be so transparent. And while this study released a small amount of particles, there are no specific regulations to limit a future study from making a larger release. Given the stakes, Khalid says there should be global input into research frameworks. ""Research leads to deployment at some time,"" he says. ""There needs to be a global discussion around this issue.""""I have an obligation to do what I can""Right now, most solar geoengineering research is funded and carried out by people in the Global North, in places like Silicon Valley. That worries Khalid. ""When we're talking about solar geoengineering, it's important to contextualize it from this perspective,"" he says, ""of somebody who's sitting here in Pakistan, who's recently seen  the 2022 floods .""Those floods, which scientists found  were made worse because of global warming , left almost  a third of the country underwater at their peak , and left hundreds of thousands of displaced people in camps. Just as global warming's impacts are often felt more in developing countries, some scientists fear developing countries could also be particularly vulnerable to solar geoengineering's risks.""You can get some strong kinds of winners and losers,"" Trisos says. ""And that's especially concerning because a lot of these developing countries in the tropics, such as in Africa, Asia, and parts of Latin America, right now don't have a strong voice in the solar geoengineering conversation.""Some nonprofits are trying to change that. In the past year  The Alliance for Just Deliberation on Solar Geoengineering  has started consultations and workshops in South Africa, India and Pakistan to educate local scientists and civil society groups about solar geoengineering. The U.K.-based  Degrees Initiative  has awarded $900,000 to scientists from Brazil, Indonesia, Nigeria and other countries to study solar geoengineering.During the United Nations Environment Assembly in Nairobi this past February, Switzerland put forth a proposal for more global research on solar geoengineering. While it didn't pass, Talati, who was at the talks, says they left her encouraged. ""That was a glimmer of hope for me,"" she says.

Odette Yousef,"When Robert Harvey read the report from Maryland State Police last month alleging that a middle school student had been repeatedly targeted with anti-Semitic harassment by her classmates, the Calvert County, Md., state's attorney was deeply disturbed.""I saw this report of this incident and immediately asked that there be further investigation and ultimately determined, after looking at the law, that we believe that charges for hate crimes were appropriate,"" Harvey told NPR.Because the case involves minors, the charges are sealed and NPR was unable to reach the defendants. Reached through Harvey, the complainant and her family declined to speak with a reporter. But Harvey has shared some of the allegations publicly. After his office filed charges,  it put out a press release .""They were harassing [the victim] over several months, drawing swastikas on notepaper and showing them to her,""  he said. ""They were holding their finger under their nose like a Hitler mustache and making derogatory comments about her physical appearance.""Harvey said that his office found no indication that allegations of what occurred at Plum Point Middle School included acts or threats of violence. Still, it filed misdemeanor hate crimes charges against three 13-year-olds and petitioned the state's Department of Juvenile Justice for supervision of three 12-year-olds. The cases of those facing criminal charges will also go to that department, where an intake officer may opt to drop the charges if the youths fulfill an alternative course of remedy, such as community service, apologies or remedial instruction. ""I wanted to be sure that whatever happens, I'm aware of it,"" Harvey said. ""And I want to be sure that whatever happens to these young men, it meets my criteria that they be held to some degree accountable for what they did.""The use of criminal hate crime charges against children has surprised some, especially those who track how common it has become for kids to be exposed to extremist ideologies.""A youth of 12 or 13 should not be facing hate crimes charges,"" said Brian Hughes, who's with American University and is co-founder and executive director of the Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab (PERIL).It is key, he said,   for Calvert County leaders, both inside the school system and outside of it, to ensure that the student who was targeted by the harassment is receiving the support she needs. But it is also a moment for them to refocus on what's needed to create a healthier, more resilient learning environment where students do not feel emboldened to openly express hateful ideologies. Because, Hughes noted, children even younger than 12 years old are almost inevitably going to encounter those ideologies. ""Any child who has access to the Internet, especially unsupervised access to the Internet, is going to encounter neo-Nazi propaganda very quickly,"" Hughes said. ""There are [hate] groups that specifically hang out in Roblox, which is a very popular game with pre-teens.""As national attention has recently focused on the question of anti-Semitism on college campuses, FBI statistics show that, historically, reported hate crime offenses have occurred more often at elementary and secondary schools. The agency's latest breakdown shows that in 2022, there were roughly 900 reported offenses at K-12 schools. Most have targeted Black people, with anti-Jewish offenses coming in next.<h2>Re-socializing kids after the COVID remote-school era has been a challenge</h2>Calvert County school officials did not respond to questions from NPR about how much teachers or staff knew of the alleged harassment, and what, if anything, they had been doing about it. A statement said ""Upon completion of an investigation, students and school personnel may be subject to disciplinary action or consequences for discriminatory behaviors.""Mary Bonney, herself a graduate of the Calvert County schools, said she regularly sees students grappling with ideologies that they encounter, which conflict with the values they're taught at school. Bonney runs the Calvert Peace Project, which helps to foster community collaboration and understanding. The program has worked with youth in some of the schools. She said there's been the added challenge, in recent years, of re-socializing children after the COVID period, during which they attended schools remotely.""Students aren't sure how to interact and aren't sure how to resolve their conflicts,"" said Bonney. ""We've seen that complaint over and over with the administration, with the teachers and with the students, that it's really difficult.""A member of the Church of Latter-day Saints, Bonney said that she, too, experienced harassment in middle school because of her religion. But after reporting it to a teacher, it stopped. Bonney said it's notable that in the current instance, the student and her parents felt it had reached a point where they had to go to the Maryland State Police.""If it's escalated to that point, then it's beyond just the school,"" she said. ""It requires parents and religious and civic organizations and schools and other public institutions and the community members themselves to say this is not acceptable behavior. We don't treat one another this way.""",2024-04-23 12:00:00 PM EEST,NPR,3 Maryland juveniles are charged with hate crimes.

Alina Selyukh,"Clothing store Express, a longtime mainstay of American malls, has filed for bankruptcy protection, closing dozens of stores but also eyeing a survival plan that involves getting sold.  At its peak, Express outfitted generations of mall shoppers in slacks and blouses, and even acquired brands Bonobos and UpWest. But the chain has been losing both shoppers and money, as many malls withered and people changed how they dress for work: less formal, more casual, less cookie-cutter, more attitude. Express — neither high-end, nor cheap — got left behind, dragged down further by rent and debt. Monday's  bankruptcy announcement  says the chain will close 95 Express stores, or just under a fifth of them, and all 10 UpWest stores. Last month, the New York Stock Exchange  delisted the retailer  because of its languishing stock value. Now, Express has received a bid to be acquired by a consortium. It includes brand-management firm WHP Global and major mall operators Simon Property Group and Brookfield Properties. The companies in recent years  have been investing  in  more retail brands  in need of  a resuscitation . New Express CEO Stewart Glendinning acknowledged ""missteps"" in clothing selection, ""most notably in women's, where we were out of balance across categories, price points and wearing occasions,"" he told investors in November, adding: ""We believe strongly there's a path to total company improvement.""In its bankruptcy filing, Express said it's also receiving an infusion of $35 million in new financing from some of its lenders, plus another $49 million from the Internal Revenue Service related to the  CARES Act , the federal coronavirus relief package.",2024-04-22 22:01:00 PM EEST,NPR,"Clothing store Express, a mall favorite, has filed for bankruptcy",https://www.npr.org/2024/04/22/1246373948/express-mall-store-files-bankruptcy
"Ari Shapiro,Mallory Yu,Michael Levitt","The pandemic throttled many parts of the American economy, just as President Biden was taking office. Since then, jobless numbers have dropped and unemployment is below 4%. Yet, a recent poll conducted by  The Economist  and  YouGov  found that more than 50% of participants felt the economy was getting worse overall. And that's important because Americans often rank the economy as a top voting issue.All Things Considered  spoke with four ""American Indicators"" throughout the Biden presidency, four people in different parts of the country reflecting different parts of the economy. Now that it's an election year, they spoke with NPR again — this time, to talk about their own politics.Travel Bhavesh Patel is a franchise hotel owner — think brands like Comfort Inn and Hampton Inn — in the Northeast United States. When he first spoke with NPR in 2021, the country was beginning to emerge from the pandemic recession. At the time, he owned seven hotels in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Illinois. In the years since, he has had to downsize.""We sold off three properties, so we're down to four now.""He says his two sons, both in their 20s, are pursuing careers in medicine, instead of going into the family business — and Patel says he can't blame them.""It's a tough market to be in right now."" Patel says. When he graduated from college in 1990, the hotel industry ""was a lucrative business. You didn't have all these rules, regulations, brand specs. But now, things have gotten tighter. It has gotten more complicated to run a hotel.""Patel says right now, high-end hotels are doing much better than the midscale places he runs. The wealth gap has  continued to grow  over the last few years. Between those challenges and tighter regulations, he sometimes wonders whether he should have chosen a different career.""I don't want the government telling me how to run my business,"" he says. ""I don't want all these different rules and stipulations out there and whatnot.""Patel calls himself a moderate Republican. He voted for former President Donald Trump in 2016, then for President Biden in 2020. And he still hasn't decided who he's going to vote for this time around.""We will see where the campaign goes and what's to come in the next couple of months.""HousingLee Camp is a housing attorney in St. Louis. In his city, he says, rents keep increasing and the availability of housing is decreasing. ""I'm certainly not hearing anyone in the renter space, particularly the low-income renter space, excited about the direction of the economy,"" he says.Things have improved since the summer of 2021, when he first spoke with NPR. At the time, his office's phones were being inundated with people asking for housing assistance, as a pandemic moratorium on evictions ended. In 2024, he says it's still a tumultuous time.""What is extremely unfortunate at this point is that the eviction filings themselves are as high as I've ever seen them in my career.""According to the Eviction Lab, which tracks eviction filings, there were 1,288 eviction filings in the past month, 124% of average filings for the same month before the pandemic.""It certainly worries me that still our most vulnerable individuals — that's renters that are low-income individuals — are experiencing homelessness, that they're really still having a tough time and that systems like the courts and evictions are still dominating their narrative and their experience of the economy right now.""Now, he is encouraged that more of his clients are working or finding new jobs than they were during the pandemic. But Camp points to high consumer prices as an ongoing worry.""On the flip side, everything just seems more expensive for [my clients] as well,"" he says. ""And I certainly personally feel that too.""Camp says he and his wife can afford the increase in cost of groceries, but they still feel the extra burden. And Camp says there's another thing on his mind when it comes to the economy.""One thing that's been substantially changing is the resumption of student loan payments. I love my career. I love that I get to serve people and work alongside so many inspiring and amazing individuals. But the loan payments are back, and that has certainly changed our financial picture in our household.""He adds, ""I would encourage [the Biden Administration] to go further, particularly if they get the option to do so in a second term.""FoodWhen Brooke Neubauer, founder of the Just One Project, the largest distributor of groceries to at-risk individuals in Nevada, looks at the economy today, she says there are plenty of jobs, but ""what I'm hearing from my clients is that the wages have not caught up with the cost of living."" Nevada has the second-highest grocery prices in the nation, behind California, with an average of nearly $300 spent on groceries per week.""For our clients that are coming in, they're saving on average $250 to $300 a month with us, and they're able to get dairy and produce, meats and poultry and all the things that you and I would get at the store.""Neubauer points to systemic issues that make it difficult for people to access food, like  food deserts , grocery stores pulling out of lower-income neighborhoods and the closure of hundreds of Family Dollar locations across the country.The Just One Project serves about 20,000 people a month. At the peak of the pandemic, the organization was serving about 58,000 people a month, nearly three times as many. And over the years, their organization has felt the rising cost of food, as she told NPR in 2023.""Purchasing millions of pounds a year of food, our grocery bill has gone up tremendously, and for us, we purchase in such large quantities, it's hitting us pretty hard.""When it comes to politics, she wants a president who will invest in social services, particularly for people like her clients. ""I'm not a fan of a president who is unkind,"" she says. ""And look, I spend my life's work trying to make the world a better place. I spend my time as a mom teaching my kids to be kind and inspiring them to be loving. I couldn't bear to vote for a presidential candidate that was not aligned with my values.""Neubauer has voted for both Democrats and Republicans in the past, and she says she has an open mind when going to the polls. But she's decided on this election.""I just can't fathom that Donald Trump is the best thing that we have come up with to run for president.""ManufacturingIn Georgia, Lisa Winton, co-founder of Winton Machine Company, sees herself as a pocketbook voter – not just for herself, but for the 40 people her company employs.""I have those 40 people to think about and I have their families to think about, and then I have my vendors to think about,"" she says. ""So it's hard not to think about those fiscal policies.""Winton says last year, the economy looked good — her company had their best year by 20%, a banner year. As a result, she says her company had looked into opening a second factory, but her lease on her current space nearly doubled, and they had to put those plans on hold.Winton considers herself ""fiscally conservative and socially liberal,"" which puts her in a frustrating spot. ""I am not a party voter. I vote for a candidate based on fiscal policies and also based on some social policies as well.""Asked which candidate she thinks will get her vote, she answers, ""I am so torn. I don't know yet.""""I'm not happy with the current administration,"" she says. ""I'm not happy with a lot of policies that have been enacted. But I'm also, on a social standpoint, not happy with some policies.""Ultimately, Winton wants to see a moderate candidate in the White House, and she doesn't feel that either of the options in front of her fit that description.""Like so many other voters, I feel like there has to be a better solution.""",2024-04-22 12:00:00 PM EEST,NPR,Four 'American Indicators' share their view of the U.S. economy — and their politics,https://www.npr.org/2024/04/22/1245872098/four-american-indicators-share-their-view-of-the-u-s-economy-and-their-politics
Windsor Johnston,"Sy Kirby dreaded the thought of going to college after graduating from high school. He says a four-year degree just wasn't in the cards for him or his bank account.""I was facing a lot of pressure for a guy that knew for a fact that he wasn't going to college,"" Kirby says. ""I knew I wasn't going to sit in a classroom, especially since I knew I wasn't going to pay for it.""Instead, at the age of 19, Kirby took a job at a local water department in southern Arkansas. He said the position helped him to develop the skills that helped him start his own construction company.Now at age 32, Kirby finds himself mentoring many of his employees, who also opted to learn a skilled trade rather than shelling out tens of thousands of dollars to pursue a degree that they wouldn't use after graduating.Kirby says blue-collar work is lucrative and allows him to ""call the shots"" in his life. But, he says the job also comes with a downside, mainly because of the stigma attached to the industry.""I think there's a big problem with moms and dads coming home from quote-unquote 'dirty' jobs. Coming home with dirty clothes and sweating. You had a hard day's work and sometimes that's looked down upon,"" he says.Kirby is among the growing number of young people who have chosen to swap college for vocational schools that offer paid, on-the-job training. <h2>Skilled trades make a comeback</h2>Lisa Countryman-Quiroz is the CEO of   JVS, or Jewish Vocational Service, a nonprofit in San Francisco that provides career training for unemployed workers to find jobs, including in skilled trades. She says that over the years there has been a shift — with skilled trade making a comeback, especially among members of Generation Z. ""Folks have really prioritized a college education as a path to the middle class and a path to a cushy office job."" But, Countryman-Quiroz says, ""over the last 10 to 15 years, we are seeing a trend among young people opting out of universities. Just the crushing debt of college is becoming a barrier in and of itself.""   More than half of Gen Zers say it's possible to get a well-paying job with only a high school diploma, provided one acquires other skills. That's according to  a survey  by New America, a Washington Think Tank that focuses on a range of public policy issues, including technology, education and the economy. <h2>The high cost of college prompts a change in career paths</h2>In addition, the Education Data Initiative says the average cost of college in the United States  has more than doubled  in the 21st century. With that price tag increasing, many Gen Zers say they've been left with no choice but to leave the college path. Many say living with their parents until they can pay off their college debt isn't an option.Nitzan Pelman is founder of Climb Hire, a company that helps low-income and overlooked people break into new careers. She says many young people say graduating from college with a six-figure debt is a non-starter.""It's not a secret that the cost of college has gone up so dramatically in the last decade that it's really cost prohibitive at this point,"" she says. Pelman says pursuing skilled trades can also help ""level the playing field,"" especially for young people from less-privileged backgrounds and for people of color.  ""We don't see a lot of Black men in construction, but more Latino men in construction and you don't see many women in construction. Social capital is a really big gatekeeper and a door-opener for accessing high-quality jobs and helping people break into certain industries,"" she says.In 2021,   President Biden signed a $1.2 trillion  bipartisan infrastructure bill.  Since then, he's been traveling the country promoting the law,   which he says will open up thousands of new jobs in trades. <h2>""You can expect to get your hands dirty and that's OK""</h2>The high cost of college isn't the only factor driving many young people toward skilled trades. With the use of artificial intelligence on the rise, many Gen Zers see manual labor   as less vulnerable   to the emerging technology than white-collar alternatives. They also say vocational schools are a straight path to well-paying jobs.Pelman says increasing salaries and new technologies in fields such as welding, plumbing and machine tooling are giving trade professions a face-lift, making them more appealing to the younger crowd. ""There are a lot of vocational jobs out there that are pretty attractive — HVAC repair and installation, electricians, solar panel installer — there's so much demand for wind turbine installers who, in many cases, make more than $100,000 a year — so there's a lot of demand for manual labor,"" she stresses. That was the case for 25-year-old Diego Aguilar, who says a traditional desk job was out of the question for him. Aguilar now works full time at a trade center at East Bay Municipal Utility District in Oakland, Calif., after going through the JVS training program. ""When I went into a trade program I learned how much money I could make performing a very specific kind of work. You need mechanics, you need machinists, you need carpenters, operators you need painters. You can expect to get your hands dirty and that's OK,"" Aguilar says. Data from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center shows the number of students enrolled in vocational-focused community colleges  increased 16%  from 2022 to 2023. As for Kirby, he says his mission is to keep raising awareness about what he calls the ""toolbelt generation."" ""Where they can walk out of the school of hard knocks, pick an industry, work your 10 years, take your punches, take your licks and hopefully you're bringing jobs and careers back to the community,"" he says. When asked if he regrets his decision to go into skilled trades, Kirby chuckles. ""Not for a second,"" he says. ",2024-04-22 12:02:00 PM EEST,NPR,Many in Gen Z ditch colleges for trade schools.

Bobby Allyn,"Legislation forcing TikTok to be sold, or face a nationwide ban, is moving rapidly through Congress and is expected to become law this week. Nobody anticipates that the app will disappear any time soon, but the measure has set off alarms inside TikTok, which is, yet again, preparing to go to court to fight for its existence in the U.S. <h2>What happened?</h2>On Saturday, the House  passed  a measure giving ByteDance, TikTok's China- based owner, up to a year to divest from the hit video-sharing app or be put out of business in the U.S. Since it was added to an aid package providing support for Israel and Ukraine, it passed overwhelmingly. It is expected to be approved by the Senate on Tuesday. President Biden has signaled that he will sign it.It will mark the first time ever Congress has passed legislation aimed at shutting down a social media platform, something U.S. government officials have  long criticized  other nations for doing. Lawmakers from both parties say TikTok is a national security risk, fearing Chinese government officials could ask the app for data on millions of Americans, or push the service to amplify disinformation ahead of the November election.TikTok has long said the Chinese government has never asked for Americans' data, and if it were asked, the company says it would refuse to comply. But under Chinese national intelligence laws, TikTok would be legally bound to hand over information on American users of the app. Critics of the legislation argue TikTok is being unfairly caught up in the geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, pointing out that China has already amassed digital dossiers on Americans through suspected hacking operations, leaving little need for data on how millions of Americans are watching videos on TikTok. <h2>What happens when Biden signs the bill?</h2>An immediate legal battle. NPR has confirmed that TikTok is readying a federal lawsuit seeking to block the law. The company is planning to allege that curbing the speech of the 170 million Americans who use the platform is a First Amendment violation.Experts say allowing the government to limit speech requires clearing a very tall legal hurdle, but one way to do so is by proving the speech restriction was enacted in the name of national security, which has long been the justification for cracking down on TikTok.Yet lawmakers have not offered any public evidence showing that the Chinese government has ever weaponized TikTok against Americans.<h2>TikTok has a history of court wins</h2>Previous attempts to shutter TikTok in the U.S. have not been successful.Three separate federal district judges have blocked efforts to ban TikTok — two courts during the Trump administration, and one more recently in Montana.U.S. District Court Judge Wendy Beetlestone in Philadelphia found in 2020 that TikTok's national security threat is ""phrased in the hypothetical.""In late 2023, U.S. District Court Judge Donald Molloy in Missoula said that a crusade by officials in Montana to block TikTok within the state's borders had a ""pervasive undertone of anti-Chinese sentiment.""<h2>Who would buy TikTok?</h2>Since the app is one of the largest and most valuable social media platforms in the world, analysts estimate that it could likely cost more than $100 billion. That means only the biggest technology companies, like Meta, Microsoft, Google and Amazon, would be able to afford to purchase the app, though the Biden administration's anti-trust enforcers would likely challenge such an acquisition.Other possible suiters include former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has said he's putting together a group of investors to try to buy TikTok. But any deal would require a blessing from the Chinese government, which, in 2020, placed ""content-recommendation algorithms"" on the country's export control list. That means that TikTok's much-coveted algorithm could only be sold with the approval of Beijing, and the Chinese government has indicated it would not approve the forced sale of TikTok's technology. Buying TikTok without its algorithm would be like purchasing ColaCola without its secret recipe. It would  represent  ""an empty deal."" <h2>Meta and Google would be the winners of a TikTok ban</h2>While there are many technical obstacles to enforcing the ban of a social media app, and ways to circumvent such a restriction, the legislation would make it illegal for web-hosting companies to support TikTok. It also would force Apple and Google to remove TikTok from its app stores, making it impossible for TikTok to receive critical software update, leading to its eventual, if very slow, death.Analysts have also said that the biggest beneficiaries of a TikTok ban would be Meta and Google, since TikTok users would likely move to Reels, a TikTok rival available on Meta-owned Instagram, or Google's competing service, YouTube Shorts.Before any of that becomes a possibility, though, TikTok and the Biden administration will be squaring up in court, where arguments over balancing free speech with national security could take years to finally resolve. While there is no telling exactly how quickly, or if ever, the legislation will prompt TikTok to be shuttered, the saga represents one of the most existential battles the app has ever faced.

Andrea Hsu,"When Starbucks barista Florentino Escobar first heard that the Supreme Court had taken up a case involving him and six of his co-workers from Memphis, Tenn., he was shocked.""I was like, 'Wait, the Supreme Court? Like we're talking the U.S. Supreme Court?'"" he says.Escobar is one of the Memphis 7, a group of Starbucks baristas and shift supervisors who were fired by the company in February 2022, days after they announced their intent to unionize.Starbucks said the employees had violated multiple company policies, including allowing a television crew into the store after hours. The workers believe they were fired for trying to organize a union.On Tuesday, the Supreme Court heard arguments — not about whether Starbucks illegally interfered with the union drive, but about whether a lower court erred in ordering Starbucks to reinstate Escobar and his co-workers while their firings were being investigated.That order and the decision to grant it are at the heart of the case in front of the nine justices. During oral arguments, the majority of the Supreme Court appeared sympathetic to Starbucks, which argued that the government should have to meet a higher legal bar when it asks courts to intervene during labor investigations.The Supreme Court's ruling, expected by the end of June, could have far-reaching implications for labor organizing efforts across the U.S. and across industries, from auto to retail to academia and beyond.<h2>An important tool</h2>The order, called a 10(j) injunction, is arguably the most powerful tool the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has to enforce the law. It's also one of the few tools the agency has at its disposal.Created by Congress in 1935, the NLRB is tasked with safeguarding workers' rights to form unions and collectively seek better working conditions. However, Congress did not give the labor agency the power to fine or otherwise penalize companies for violating those rights.Enter the 10(j) injunction.When the NLRB believes unfair labor practices have occurred, it can ask a federal district court to temporarily halt whatever is going on while labor officials gather evidence, hold a hearing and rule on the case.That's what happened with this Starbucks case. After a preliminary investigation into the Memphis firings, the  NLRB asked a federal court in Tennessee for an injunction . The court granted the request and ordered Starbucks to stop interfering with its employees' union activities and temporarily reinstate the Memphis 7.""To sort of stop the bleeding,"" explains Sharon Block, a Harvard Law School professor and former NLRB board member.That's critical, Block says, because it can take months or even years for the NLRB to process cases. If the allegedly illegal behavior can't be stopped while a case is under investigation, any remedy the labor board might issue as part of a final ruling could be meaningless.""Life moves on,"" Block says. ""The organizing campaign may be dead by the time the board issues a decision, because everybody got freaked out by the lead union organizers getting fired.""<h2>A legal fight ensues</h2>In Memphis, the organizing campaign did not die. Union organizers pressed on, the union election was held and baristas voted 11 to 3 to join Workers United, the Starbucks employees union. With the injunction granted, the members of the Memphis 7 went back to work while the NLRB looked into their case.But Starbucks, unhappy with the lower court's decision to grant the injunction, asked the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to block it. The court said no. The 6th Circuit agreed with the lower court that ""because of the chilling impact of the terminations on Union support, some of the requested interim relief, including temporary reinstatement of the Memphis Seven, was just and proper.""That's when Starbucks took the case to the Supreme Court.<h2>Two different standards</h2>Starbucks is asking the Supreme Court  to weigh in on whether some federal circuits — including the 6th Circuit — set too low a bar for granting injunctions.Starbucks points to the onerous burden that injunctions can impose on employers, including forcing them to reinstate employees they fired for violations of company policy, and argues that injunctive relief should be granted only in extraordinary cases — and that there should be consistency in how it is granted.Currently, federal courts use two different standards, or tests, when deciding whether to grant injunctions in cases involving labor organizing. Starbucks wants the Supreme Court to impose one standard across the courts — the one Starbucks considers more rigorous.Bill Baker, an associate with the employment law firm Wigdor, doubts whether that would make much of a difference.He studied 10(j) injunction petitions filed between 2011 and 2020 and found that those subjected to what is known as the ""more relaxed"" test were in fact denied at higher rates.Moreover, he found that a majority of injunction petitions filed during that period were filed in just two federal circuits — the 2nd and the 9th — both of which already use the test Starbucks favors.""Whatever the Supreme Court's decision on this is, it won't impact the decisions that these two circuits are making,"" say Baker. ""I'm sort of skeptical that in the real world, it would have an enormous impact on labor organizing.""<h2>Potential for a strong signal to judges</h2>Still, Harvard's Block worries about the message that a Supreme Court ruling could send.""If the court says that the standard that was used in this case was wrong, the court is going to be sending a very strong signal that judges should bring more scrutiny to these cases,"" she says.With employers like Starbucks mounting historically aggressive anti-union campaigns, Block says it's the exact wrong time for the Supreme Court to be making it more difficult for federal labor officials to protect workers' rights.<h2>Watching from Memphis</h2>In Memphis, Escobar says he'll be following Tuesday's arguments at the Supreme Court.""My biggest fear is ... the Supreme Court making it much harder for labor unions across the nation to follow in our footsteps,"" he says.Meanwhile, there has been some movement in the labor board's investigation of the Memphis 7 case. In May 2023, more than a year after the original incident, an NLRB administrative law judge ruled that Starbucks did indeed violate the law when it terminated five of the seven workers, including Escobar, but not the other two.As part of the NLRB process, that ruling is now awaiting review by a panel of board members, who could uphold it or modify it.

Michael Copley,"Negotiators from about 175 countries have been sparring for more than a year over a treaty to clean up plastic pollution that's choking rivers and piling up in landfills. As a critical new round of deliberations starts this week in Canada, the talks are floundering. Some scientists and civil society groups say the United States bears a lot of the blame.Almost every piece of plastic is made from fossil fuels, and major oil and natural gas producers like Russia and Saudi Arabia have also been widely criticized for throwing up roadblocks in the negotiations. However, scientists and environmentalists following the talks say the U.S. exerts outsized influence on the process. The country is the top producer of oil and gas globally, and it has the world's biggest economy, which has historically given the U.S. huge sway in environmental negotiations.  So far, American negotiators have been unwilling to push for measures in the treaty that would drive big cuts in plastic waste, critics say, like caps on manufacturing. Instead, they say, U.S. government representatives have put their weight behind policies around recycling and waste management that are  favored by the country's giant fossil fuel and petrochemical industries . Researchers say those actions on their own won't drastically reduce plastic pollution.""I don't think it's an understatement to say that where we're headed at right now with progress in negotiations is towards failure. And if there's one country that I think is responsible for that, I think it's the United States,"" says Douglas McCauley, a professor of environmental science at University of California, Santa Barbara, who has consulted with the U.S. State Department about the treaty and is attending the talks in Ottawa.NPR spoke to seven scientists and environmental advocates who have consulted with the U.S. government about the plastics negotiations, some multiple times. Many of those experts contend that an absence of U.S. leadership is hindering efforts to push forward a treaty with effective regulations. The outcome of the negotiations could also have big implications for human health. A recent study  found plastics contain more than 4,200 hazardous chemicals , the vast majority of which aren't regulated globally, according to the researchers.""It's not that the U.S. is actively opposing some of these policies that could make a difference,"" McCauley says. ""It's that they are showing no action whatsoever, no ambition whatsoever, for adopting any of these policies.""In a letter to President Biden in March , a coalition of more than 300 scientists said policy recommendations the government received from plastic manufacturers — and the government's own stance in the talks to date —  are ""inconsistent"" with efforts to deal comprehensively with plastic waste. And a group of nine Democratic attorneys general whose states are grappling with plastic pollution recently  urged the U.S. treaty delegation to back stronger global rules , saying the country is ""uniquely positioned"" to influence the negotiations.""There is an important role the U.S. could play in addressing the growing influence of industry on these negotiations,"" says Carroll Muffett, chief executive of the Center for International Environmental Law who is an observer at the negotiations and whose organization has consulted with the State Department about the treaty. ""So far, we have yet to see the U.S. on the right side of that issue.""A State Department spokesperson said in a statement to NPR that U.S. officials met with ""a wide set of stakeholders"" ahead of the negotiations in Canada, and that the country has a ""central role in bridging differing positions"" in the talks. For an agreement to be effective, it needs to be supported by every country, the spokesperson said, including major plastic producers and consumers.Matt Seaholm, chief executive of a business group called the Plastics Industry Association, says the U.S. is doing ""a very good job of trying to balance all of the interests"" of different stakeholders.""The U.S. government has positioned itself well to drive forward a workable, consensus-based agreement,"" Ross Eisenberg, president of another industry group called America's Plastic Makers, said in a statement.<h2>It's a pivotal moment in the negotiations</h2>The world  produces about 400 million metric tons of plastic waste  every year, according to the United Nations Environment Programme  — roughly  the weight of every human on the planet . Most of it ends up in places like oceans, shorelines and landfills, where it breaks down into tiny pieces called microplastics that have been found in every corner of the environment and inside human bodies.The problem is getting worse. The amount of plastic waste the world produces is  expected to almost triple  in the coming decades, with less than a fifth recycled, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. So in 2022, countries agreed to  negotiate a legally binding agreement  to ""end plastic pollution."" With months to go before a deadline to hash out the treaty, interest groups on all sides of the issue say this is a pivotal moment. The last round of negotiations in Kenya  ended in deadlock . Afterward, environmental groups warned the talks were at risk of collapsing after some oil- and gas-producing countries blocked a final decision on how to move forward.The negotiations are happening at a time when the oil and gas industry increasingly sees petrochemicals as a core part of their business. Efforts to limit the risks from climate change threaten demand for fossil fuels, but oil and gas demand for petrochemicals is expected to keep rising for years,  industry analysts say .Magnus Løvold, a policy advisor at the Norwegian Academy of International Law, says fossil-fuel producers including Russia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iran and Bahrain ""want this process to fail.""An observer at the negotiations, Løvold adds: ""The reason for that is that these countries, they have huge oil production, they have a considerable petrochemical industry, so they see that regulation of plastics is a threat to their economic interest.""The U.S. is a giant in those same industries. Booming  production of American natural gas has propelled plastic manufacturing  around the world. Last year, the country  produced, consumed and exported a record amount of ethane , which is  used in plastic manufacturing  and almost always comes from natural gas when it is produced in the U.S.Experts who have met with the State Department and who have attended the talks say U.S. negotiators could be handcuffed by domestic politics. It would be ""probably impossible"" for the Biden administration to convince  two-thirds of the Senate to approve  a plastics treaty, says Løvold of the Norwegian Academy of International Law.The U.S. government ""does not want to be the bad guy,"" says Erica Nuñez, head of The Ocean Foundation's plastics initiative who has consulted with the State Department. ""I think they do really want to come out of this with some wins. And I think they're very challenged right now in identifying what those wins are [realistically] within the U.S. context.""Against the backdrop of booming fossil fuel production, U.S. negotiators at the talks have declined to back a binding global agreement, say the state attorneys general and environmental advocates who have attended the talks. Instead, they say the U.S. has sought an accord that would leave countries free to decide for themselves how to clean up plastic pollution. ""The U.S. is really trying to reshape what could be a binding global treaty with binding global targets into a ground-up treaty where every country just says, 'Alright, this is what we're willing to do,'"" says Muffett of the Center for International Environmental Law. ""And that is inadequate.""A State Department spokesperson said the agreement needs to include ""universal obligations,"" but that ""overly prescriptive approaches"" could dissuade countries that are big producers and consumers of plastic from joining. Countries should be able to meet their obligations ""in ways that take into account their respective priorities and circumstances,"" the spokesperson said.<h2>The plastic industry says cutting production is off limits</h2>The plastics industry is fighting on two fronts to block treaty provisions that could constrain manufacturing. It is trying to stop countries from limiting how much new plastic is produced, and it opposes global regulations on the chemicals that companies use. Scientists and environmental advocates say that to make a significant dent in plastic pollution, countries have to cut how much new plastic they manufacture. But plastic makers and the oil and gas industry, which includes national oil companies and publicly traded corporations, say the world needs all the plastic they can produce, and that negotiators should focus on creating a so-called circular economy where plastic is recycled and reused to prevent waste.The industry is making that argument at the same time it  tries to fend off scrutiny  of a decades-long controversial campaign to sell recycling to the public. Investigations,  including by NPR , have shown the plastics industry promoted recycling even though  officials long knew that it probably wouldn't work on a large scale.  Former industry officials have said the goal was to avoid regulations and ensure demand for plastics kept growing.Current officials have said those investigations don't accurately portray today's industry.""We fully and readily admit that we don't recycle enough plastic,"" says Seaholm of the Plastics Industry Association. ""But what we're saying is we want to recycle more. The industry is putting billions of dollars into recycling technologies that get us where we need to be."" Seaholm says the industry also supports policies to encourage recycling, like making producers help pay for recycling infrastructure, and requiring companies to use some recycled material in plastic products.A lot of experts say recycling will have to be part of the solution, because plastic is ingrained in modern life. But they say governments need to regulate manufacturing for recycling to work. The Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty, which includes major brands like Coca-Cola, Unilever and Walmart, is  calling for governments to phase out ""problematic plastics""  that are hard to recycle or that are likely to end up as waste in the environment.A State Department spokesperson said the U.S. is advocating for measures to reduce demand for new plastic, including through government procurement policies. However, the spokesperson said countries wouldn't be stopped from also trying to limit the supply of new plastic. A lot of countries want to do that with caps on manufacturing.Reducing demand for new plastic is ""great,"" says Nuñez of The Ocean Foundation. But ""we still need to directly implement policies to limit fossil fuel extraction — which is something that the U.S. is avoiding,"" she says. As for the chemicals that go into plastic, industry representatives say they should be regulated by national governments, not by a global treaty on plastic pollution.But scientists and environmental advocates calling for global chemical regulations note that plastic waste – and the chemicals it's made from – doesn't stay in the country where it is produced. It floats down rivers and around oceans. To protect people and the environment, governments that are part of the High Ambition Coalition to End Plastic Pollution, including the European Union, Canada, and the United Kingdom, as well as a number of developing countries from Rwanda to the Maldives, want to  ""eliminate and restrict"" hazardous plastics and chemicals  globally. They also want to force companies to disclose information about the chemicals they use.""We have the evidence to show that  human health  and environmental health are being impacted,"" says Susanne Brander, an ecotoxicologist at Oregon State University who was on a call recently with the State Department discussing the plastics treaty. ""If we can't get information on what's being used,"" she adds, ""we have no way of truly making these products safer.""<h2>Lawmakers and observers warn of industry influence</h2>But groups advocating for aggressive global rules say there's been little progress in the negotiations. After more than a year of talks, governments still haven't come up with a plan that has the ""ambition and strength"" to limit plastic production and cut down on pollution, the group of state attorneys general wrote to the State Department earlier this month. The group faulted the U.S. delegation for taking a position that ""lacks concrete objectives or standards.""""The United States has the power to persuade and to be forward-leaning,"" says Margaret Spring, chief conservation and science officer at the Monterey Bay Aquarium who has consulted with the State Department on the plastics treaty and is leading a delegation at the talks for the International Science Council. ""Right now, you've seen other countries doing that. And so that's been disappointing to many of us.""Negotiators  face intense lobbying  from groups that have big financial stakes in the plastics industry. The influence of plastic producers and petrochemical companies is ""one of the largest barriers to strong action,"" a group of Democrat lawmakers, as well as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an Independent, and Mohammed Chahim, a member of the European Parliament,  wrote recently to Biden and leaders of the UN and European Commission.  Ahead of this week's negotiations in Canada, the industry said it would be a mistake to talk much about manufacturing. ""Certainly there are those in the [Biden] administration who would like to see some much more aggressive policies towards our industry, which we certainly don't agree with,"" says Seaholm of the Plastics Industry Association. ""But there are those who are truly honest brokers that we're continuing to work with.""     ",2024-04-23 12:01:00 PM EEST,NPR,Talks for a plastic pollution treaty are stalling.

Greg Rosalsky,"Well, I'm back. After a  lengthy parental leave , when publication of the  Planet Money  newsletter decreased in frequency, I'm now working full-time and the newsletter will go back to being published weekly. As always, I will continue to do my best to provide you with insights from the field of economics and keep you informed about what's going on in the economy. And, don't worry, this newsletter is not about to become all about babies. This week, however, it is. Now that I'm a working parent, I want to take just one brief moment to complain on behalf of all of us. Like millions of parents before me, I've discovered it's hard to be productive when you're sleep deprived.There's a  ginormous   mountain  of  studies  that find that sleep deprivation is a serious drag on productivity. One  recent study  by economists Joan Costa-i-Font, Sarah Fleche, and Ricardo Pagan estimates that each additional hour of sleep per week increases the probability that a person is employed by 1.6 percentage points and increases a person's weekly earnings by 3.4%. Another study  by economists Pedro Bessone and colleagues finds that it's not necessarily just the quantity of sleep hours that matters for productivity, it's also the quality of sleep. This checks out, personally. <h2>The Modern Dilemma of Juggling Career and Kids</h2>In some ways, the problem of sleep deprivation hurting productivity at work is a contemporary one. More than ever before, families have two parents who work outside the home. Historically,  many women  stayed at home and bore the brunt of baby-induced sleep deprivation. Today, more often than not, there are two drowsy parents who must go into work the next day and — not speaking from personal experience at all,  ahem  — may get into small tiffs at around 3 a.m. over whose turn it is to comfort or feed their crying baby. Plus, thanks to efforts to combat Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) — which, we should note, seem to have been  extraordinarily successful  — parents are now instructed to avoid co-sleeping and to do things like put their babies to  sleep on their backs  as opposed to their bellies. While such measures have been found to reduce the risk of SIDS, they also may make it harder for many babies to sleep because many of them naturally want to sleep on their parents or their bellies.<h2>Sleep Training</h2>For today's parents, there's a tantalizing solution to the problem of sleepless babies: sleep training. For many, ""sleep training"" is a mere euphemism for the most infamous and controversial method: Cry It Out. Basically, you put your baby in a crib or bassinet in a separate room and don't come back until the morning. If they cry, so be it. The idea is they will learn to self-soothe and become good sleepers. Not all forms of sleep training are so severe, but most do involve some tolerance for crying and, because of this, many categorize most approaches broadly under the umbrella of ""cry it out."" In her bestselling book  Cribsheet: A Data-Driven Guide to Better, More Relaxed Parenting, from Birth to Preschool , economist Emily Oster reviews the evidence on sleep training and concludes, ""The bottom line is that there is simply a tremendous amount of evidence suggesting that 'cry it out' is an effective method of improving sleep."" That said, sleep training is pretty hard, strategically, physically, and emotionally. That's why there's a whole cottage industry of  high-paid sleep trainers ,  books ,  consultants ,  podcasts , influencers, and so on, who help parents with all this. Recognizing that sleeplessness is a problem for employees to be the most productive,  companies   like Meta  (aka Facebook) have begun subsidizing the cost of sleep training coaching for their workers. <h2>The Online War Over Sleep Training</h2>Ever since we had a baby — and apparently started googling baby-related stuff — my wife and I have found our social media feeds to be jam-packed with baby-rearing and sleep training content.For example, my wife was targeted with  a post  from a baby sleep consultancy called Taking Cara Babies that marketed their services to us (and our employers). ""It's true! Taking Cara Babies has a way your company can give you the gift of sleep (which will help you thrive as an employee). For more information to send to your boss or HR department, head to my stories or comment."" It seemed pretty innocuous. But the most liked comment was the following: ""Wish we had actual parental leave like the rest of the modern world so we weren't forced to sleep train and get back to work like good little capitalists."" It turns out this sentiment can be found  across the internet , in comments, on sites like Reddit and X (formerly Twitter), and by influencers. There's a large community of parents who disparage sleep training — and, in particular, any form of cry it out — as basically a cruel practice that sacrifices our babies' well-being on the altar of capitalism.Whole Mother Therapy, which provides online therapy to parents, for example,  argues on their blog  that ""Sleep training is a symptom of capitalism—it cuts parents off from the natural attachment and nurturance that is essential for infant and baby development.""""Sleep training is breaking your child's mind and nervous system to fit into the productivity model capitalism requires,"" tweeted  an X user named ℍℝ . But is not wanting to be really sleep deprived only driven by economic concerns? If I had the luxury of not working, I probably would still want to be well-slept. And aren't there a whole bunch of countries that have capitalist economies — but, at the same time, robust safety nets — that give parents greater opportunity to stay home and be sleep-deprived without having to go into work? I'll let you be the judge.One of the biggest schools that opposes sleep training, or at least strategies that tolerate baby crying, is known as attachment parenting. This approach advises parents against letting babies cry on the grounds that crying is an expression of distress and that it's unnatural and cruel to not do everything in our power to prevent it. I have friends who pursued attachment parenting. They not only refused to let their babies cry at night without intervention, but they also let their babies sleep in their beds (which, by the way, is  not recommended  by health experts for at least the first six months of your baby's life). And let me tell you, years later, their kids are still interrupting their sleep. Not for us.Emily Oster points out that sleep training has sizable benefits for parents. She cites a randomized controlled trial that found that mothers ""were less likely to be depressed and more likely to have better physical health"" months after sleep training their babies. ""This finding is consistent across studies,"" Oster continues. ""Sleep-training methods consistently improve parental mental health; this includes less depression, higher marital satisfaction, and lower parenting stress.""But what about the baby's mental and physical health? In reviewing the literature, Oster finds no credible evidence that babies' long-term well-being is impaired by sleep training. ""Fundamentally, the argument against sleep training is theoretical,"" Oster argues. She admits that it'd be better if we had more studies on this. ""And yes, it is possible that if we had more data, we would find some small negative effects,"" she admits. But, at the same time, she says, it's also possible that, by promoting good sleep hygiene, sleep training could actually be a benefit to babies. She concludes that ""You'll have to make a choice about this without perfect data.""As for us, we've pursued a strategy that you might call sleep training lite. Basically, when our baby cries in the night, we either feed him if it's been a while since he's eaten or we hold his hand and sing Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star to him while he stays in his crib. Honestly, it worked really well between months 4 and 7. But recently, he started teething, and... well, we're both really tired. Take that, capitalism.",2024-04-23 13:30:00 PM EEST,NPR,"Sleep training: Life preserver for parents or ""symptom of capitalism""?",https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2024/04/23/1245852236/sleep-training-life-preserver-for-parents-or-symptom-of-capitalism
None,"All Things Considered has been speaking with four ""American Indicators"" since 2021. They're four people in different parts of the country reflecting different parts of the economy. Now that it's an election year, they spoke with NPR again — this time, to talk about how the economy is shaping their own politics.<h2>1.Travel</h2>Bhavesh Patel is a franchise hotel owner, like Comfort Inn in the Northeast United States. When he first spoke with NPR in 2021, the country was beginning to emerge from the pandemic recession. At the time, he owned seven hotels in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Illinois.  In the years since, he has had to downsize.""We sold off three properties, so we're down to four now.""Patel says his line of hotels has continued to struggle in the wake of the pandemic, and that right now, high end hotels are  doing much better as the wealth gap has continued to grow in the U.S.  He's frustrated by the increase in regulation for his business, and considers himself a moderate Republican. For now, he isn't sure who he'll be voting for.<h2>2.Cost of living</h2>Lee Camp is a housing attorney in St. Louis. In his city, he says, rents keep increasing and the availability of housing is decreasing. After witnessing a wave of clients facing eviction during the pandemic,  Camp says that economic pressures have gotten worse across the board.""I love my career. I love that I get to serve people and work alongside so many inspiring and amazing individuals. But the loan payments are back, and that has certainly changed our financial picture in our household.""When Brooke Neubauer, founder of the Just One Project, the largest distributor of groceries to at-risk individuals in Nevada, looks at the economy today, she says there are plenty of jobs, but says that  ""what I'm hearing from my clients is that the wages have not caught up with the cost of living.""Neubauer says that her program's spending has gone up tremendously as the price of food has gone up as well. And for her, a candidate that  values social services is a priority.<h2>3.Manufacturing</h2>In Georgia, Lisa Winton, co-founder of Winton Machine Company, sees herself as a pocketbook voter –  not just for herself, but for the 40 people her company employs.Winton says last year, the economy looked good — her company had their best year by 20%, a banner year. As a result, she says her company had looked into opening a second factory, but her lease on her current space nearly doubled, and they had to put those plans on hold.And while her business might be doing better with the help of some Trump-era tax policies,  Winton expressed that the Republican party's shift to the right on some social issues is causing her concern.",2024-04-23 23:25:00 PM EEST,NPR,How voters from different economic sectors see the 2024 election,https://www.npr.org/2024/04/23/1198911313/american-indicators-voters-2024-election-perspective-biden-trump-values

Camila Domonoske,"After a barrage of bad news and a sharp drop in profits at Tesla, CEO Elon Musk sought to reassure investors on Tuesday that the revolutionary electric vehicle company is still on a long-term path to growth — thanks to AI and autonomous vehicles.""We're putting the actual 'auto' in 'automobile,' "" Musk said, to chuckles from his executive team.  ""The future is really bright,"" Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja added later. ""We just have to get through this period and get there."" ""This period,"" though, is rough. Profits were down 55% for the quarter compared to a year ago, after sales decreased and Tesla repeatedly cut prices. A number of top executives are leaving, including the head of investor relations, who dropped that news on the Tuesday earnings call. Tesla is laying off more than 10% of its global staff, and executives are clamming up when investors ask for more details about a long-promised $25,000 vehicle.In defending the company's performance, Musk and other executives pointed to  broader challenges in the EV industry , as well as headwinds like an arson attack at Tesla's Berlin plant and the cost of launching the Cybertruck. They emphasized that they still see a bright future for electric vehicles.Tesla stock rose after the earnings call. Analysts at Jefferies assessed that Musk had ""appeased"" Wall Street by promising to release new vehicle models, including more affordable cars, earlier than anticipated. <h2>The future of the $25,000 car is murky</h2>In 2020, Tesla executives laid out a detailed argument for why they believed they could build a ""compelling"" EV with a price tag of $25,000. ""This has always been our dream from the beginning of the company,"" Musk said. It's also a top priority for many investors and car shoppers. The Model 3, the cheapest Tesla, currently starts at around $38,000. How could Tesla cut prices to $25k? The plan involved casting a huge portion of the car as  a single piece  — similar to how a toy car might be manufactured. Later, Tesla executives  also said  they were rethinking the entire way an assembly line works as part of cracking the code for both this cheaper mass-market vehicle and a custom-built robotaxi. Now, Tesla has essentially confirmed  reports  it's pivoting away from the mass-market vehicle portion of this plan.But ""more affordable"" vehicles will still be offered before the second half of next year, Tesla says, using existing manufacturing lines to deliver the vehicles sooner than planned. The ""revolutionary"" manufacturing process is now exclusively dedicated to the robotaxi. How affordable is ""more affordable""? Not clear. The cost savings may be smaller than previously expected, the company noted in its  investor presentation . When pushed on the timeline for that long-promised $25,000 vehicle, executives repeatedly redirected attention toward the equally-long-promised vision of robotaxis. ""The way to think of Tesla is almost entirely as solving autonomy, and being able to turn on that autonomy for a giant fleet,"" Musk said, in response to one question about the $25,000 car. ""I think we've said all we will on that front,"" he said to another. <h2>Robotaxis are almost here — yet again</h2>For years, Musk has promised that an army of robotaxis, driverless Teslas picking up passengers, is just around the corner. On Tuesday he recommitted to that vision, promising that in August Tesla will reveal the ""Cybercab,"" a vehicle custom-built for service as a taxi, as part of a fleet that could also include Tesla owners sending their cars out to make money a la Airbnb.Today, Teslas with a pricey software add-on can drive themselves down city streets, stopping at stop lights and navigating turns without human input  most  of the time. But  an attentive driver  still needs to be in the front seat to take over when needed. Tesla has recently started referring to this software as ""Full Self-Driving (Supervised),"" acknowledging that it's not truly autonomous.And operating a profitable robotaxi fleet is not just a technology problem. It requires working productively with  government regulators  and winning and keeping  public trust  — as  GM's Cruise  and  Google's Waymo  can painfully attest.""I actually do not think there will be significant regulatory barriers, provided there is conclusive data that the autonomous car is safer than a human-driven car,"" Musk said, arguing that human drivers will be as outdated as human elevator operators. Musk also sketched out a plan to use idle Teslas as a distributed AI computing business, similar in concept to Amazon Web Services cloud computing service.",2024-04-24 04:14:00 AM EEST,NPR,Tesla profits have plummeted.

Andrea Hsu,"After receiving more than 26,000 public comments, the five members of the Federal Trade Commission are set to vote Tuesday on whether to issue a final rule banning noncompetes, declaring them an unfair method of competition.In a statement last week, the FTC said the final rule under consideration ""would generally prevent most employers from using noncompete clauses."" It's not yet clear how the final rule differs from the version first proposed in January 2023.A noncompete agreement typically blocks a worker from going to work for a competitor or starting up a competing business of their own. The FTC estimates about 30 million people, or one in five American workers, from minimum wage earners to CEOs, are  bound by noncompetes .The Biden administration has argued that these agreements harm workers by lowering wages and hurt the U.S. economy by stifling entrepreneurship. ""The freedom to change jobs is core to economic liberty and to a competitive, thriving economy,"" said FTC Chair Lina M. Khan in a statement  when the proposed rule was first introduced . ""Noncompetes block workers from freely switching jobs, depriving them of higher wages and better working conditions, and depriving businesses of a talent pool that they need to build and expand.""Businesses contend that noncompetes are critical for protecting their investments and proprietary information and question whether the FTC even has the authority to regulate such agreements.Even after today's vote, the future of these agreements will be far from clear. Should the FTC vote to issue a final rule, it would not be enforced until later this year, and legal challenges are expected.<h2>FTC says noncompetes harm low-wage and high-wage earners</h2>Tuesday's vote comes 15 months after the FTC first issued its proposed rule, banning employers from entering into noncompete agreements with their employees and requiring existing agreements to be rescinded. In a fact sheet, the agency cited several real-world examples, drawn from media reports, of workers who were harmed by such clauses. One case involved a single father working as a security guard who was forced to resign his overnight job that paid $11 an hour after he lost access to nighttime child care. He landed a similar job with daytime hours that paid $15 an hour, but his old employer challenged his employment based on a noncompete he had signed, and he was fired.Another case involved a vice president at Amazon who left the company to join a tech startup. Amazon sued to try to block him from taking the new job, citing a noncompete agreement. After negative media coverage, Amazon dropped the suit, and the startup thrived.Cases elsewhere abound — in the pharmaceutical industry, janitorial services,  even zen yoga studios .The cases highlight the power differential that noncompetes can create, with lower-wage earners often more vulnerable than those in leadership positions. By allowing more workers to leave jobs for better-paying ones, the FTC estimates a rule banning noncompetes would increase the earnings of the American workforce by as much as $296 billion per year.<h2>The business community says noncompetes are vital for protecting investments</h2>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which ardently opposes the ban, says noncompetes benefit both employers and employees. Companies are more likely to spend resources training and developing their workforce if they have some reassurance that their workers won't take their knowledge to a competitor, the U.S. Chamber explained in  written comments to the FTC .Contrary to the FTC's view, the U.S. Chamber also argues that noncompetes encourage innovation, by ensuring more robust protection of trade secrets. Without noncompetes, companies may be less willing to pour large amounts of time and money into research and development, the group warned.The FTC's proposed rule did include a notable exception for noncompete agreements between sellers and buyers of businesses, meant to protect the value of the businesses being acquired. The two sides could still enter a noncompete agreement provided the seller had at least a 25% ownership interest in the business being sold.But the business community says this exception is far from enough. It has asked the FTC to consider other proposals, including an income threshold, so that companies could still enter noncompete agreements with highly-paid employees while protecting those at the lower end of the pay scale.",2024-04-23 12:00:00 PM EEST,NPR,"After 26,000 public comments, FTC to vote on rule banning noncompete agreements",https://www.npr.org/2024/04/23/1246430110/noncompete-agreements-ftc-ban-lina-khan

Andrea Hsu,"The Federal Trade Commission narrowly voted Tuesday to ban nearly all noncompetes, employment agreements that typically prevent workers from joining competing businesses or launching ones of their own.  The FTC received more than  26,000 public comments  in the months leading up to the vote. Chair Lina Khan referenced on Tuesday some of the stories she had heard from workers.""We heard from employees who, because of noncompetes, were stuck in abusive workplaces,"" she said. ""One person noted when an employer merged with an organization whose religious principles conflicted with their own, a noncompete kept the worker locked in place and unable to freely switch to a job that didn't conflict with their religious practices.""These accounts, she said, ""pointed to the basic reality of how robbing people of their economic liberty also robs them of all sorts of other freedoms.""The FTC estimates about 30 million people, or one in five American workers, from minimum wage earners to CEOs, are  bound by noncompetes . It says the policy change could lead to increased wages totaling nearly $300 billion per year by encouraging people to swap jobs freely.The ban, which will take effect later this year, carves out an exception for existing noncompetes that companies have given their senior executives, on the grounds that these agreements are more likely to have been negotiated. The FTC says employers should not enforce other existing noncompete agreements.  The vote was 3 to 2 along party lines. The dissenting commissioners, Melissa Holyoke and Andrew Ferguson, argued that the FTC was overstepping the boundaries of its power. Holyoke predicted the ban would be challenged in court and eventually struck down. Shortly after the vote, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said it would sue the FTC to block the rule, calling it unnecessary, unlawful and a blatant power grab.For more than a year, the group has vigorously opposed the ban, saying that noncompetes are vital to companies, by allowing them to better guard trade secrets, and employees, by giving employers greater incentive to invest in workforce training and development. ""This decision sets a dangerous precedent for government micromanagement of business and can harm employers, workers, and our economy,"" wrote Suzanne P.

Emma Bowman,"NEW YORK — In 100 days, Paris will kick off the  2024 Summer Olympic Games  with the opening ceremony. As the host city enters the final stretch of preparations, much has yet to be finalized.The plan for an ambitious opening ceremony on July 26 — in which athletes float down the iconic Seine River bisecting the city — is set to be the first held outside a stadium, although it  could move locations  for security reasons. And only a small fraction of athletes have found out whether they are headed to Paris.Buzz around the Games grew louder in New York this week, where U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee officials and athlete hopefuls gathered to talk about how they're preparing during the countdown. Here are some other takeaways from the Team USA media summit.<h2>Athletes prepare for a moment that may never come</h2>Hopefuls spend years training but most won't know until after qualifying events — for some, in the final few weeks before Paris — whether they've secured their spot on the Olympic team. Andrew Capobianco, a diver who competed at the Tokyo Games in 2021 is trying not to focus on the potential heartbreak.""I probably would have been more overwhelmed if it was maybe before my first one,"" he said. ""But I guess, for me, it's just — stick with the plan and train hard every day.""For some veterans, unexpected hurdles since past appearances have forced a reset of regimens and time-intensive training. A year after  Tokyo gold medalist gymnast Sunisa ""Suni"" Lee  learned she had two types of kidney diseases, she says she is now ""in remission.""""I'm feeling really good,"" she said. ""We have it under control now and like, now I know what to do and right medicine to take in order to keep going.""To get her health sorted out, she  took a break  from her sport, which meant time spent regaining the strength she had lost. ""I couldn't do any exercising and I couldn't even get out of bed most days,"" she said.She and Simone Biles, Jordan Chiles and Jade Carey are among those hoping to clinch a spot in Paris.Athletes harped on their need for consistency in their workouts, diets and sleep in the run-up to the Games. But that's easier said than done when most athletes don't make a living in their sport. Beyond the high-level competitions, many athletes hold day jobs and side gigs. But this year, some athletes will see a return on their investment with a new opportunity to cash in. Each track and field gold medalist  will be awarded $50,000  by the sport's governing body World Athletics — the first time an international federation has offered prize money to Olympic medalists.<h2>An emphasis on security</h2>Athletes who say pandemic restrictions dampened their experiences in Tokyo and Beijing are looking forward to having back family, friends and fanfare. This year, officials said they're imposing no COVID restrictions or vaccination requirements for American athletes, beyond the normal health protocols for things like flu.Officials say security is top of mind this year. Paris has been the  target of terror attacks  in the past. Heightening safety fears, these Games will happen against the backdrop of  Russia's invasion of Ukraine , as well as  Israel at war in Gaza  fighting Hamas.USOPC Chief of Security Nicole Deal says there are no current specific threats against American athletes, but that security will be comprehensive and tight. Athletes, who will be competing in events across France, will get security briefings and have access to apps with security alerts, she added. <h2>A big push for gender equality</h2>The International Olympic Committee has made an effort to make the Games more inclusive. As of Monday, only about 15% of the Team USA roster has been named, USOPC officials said. But already the IOC has touted unprecedented achievements in gender equality for the 2024 games. Paris will see an  even split of male and female  participants, officials said.Meanwhile, yet another stir over athlete uniforms has renewed charges of prevailing double standards. Nike's unveiling of this year's U.S. women's track and field uniforms  reignited criticism over designs  that sexualize female athletes. Fans and athletes panned the high-cut bodysuit. Gold medalist pole vaulter  Katie Moon expressed concern  for the revealing silhouette but clarified that the design is just one of the uniform options available to women. During the Tokyo Games, German gymnasts traded their bikini-cut leotards  in favor of long-legged unitards , in a statement about women athletes choosing what they're comfortable in.Criticizing an outfit design that other athletes may prefer is not the answer, Moon said in a social media post. ""The point is we DO have the choice of what to wear, and whether we feel the best in a potato sack or a bathing suit during competitions, we should support the autonomy.""Sarah Hirshland, CEO of the USOPC, addressed the issue on Monday, saying she supports athletes having attire options.""We want to make sure athletes have choices that they're comfortable in,"" she told reporters.In an institution known for its curveballs as much as tradition, one thing is certain. Asked about pregame superstitions on a panel of female athletes, soccer player Emily Sonnett said banana pancakes are  her ""must-have.""""If you don't have bananas that day, what are you gonna do?"" asked her teammate Crystal Dunn.""But we always have bananas,"" Sonnett retorted.",2024-04-17 12:00:00 PM EEST,NPR,"With 100 days before the Paris Olympics, Team USA hopefuls meet the press",https://www.npr.org/2024/04/17/1245221624/100-days-2024-paris-summer-olympics-team-usa-athletes

None,"Toronto Raptors two-way player Jontay Porter was banned for life from the NBA on Wednesday after a league probe found he disclosed confidential information to sports bettors and wagered on games, even betting on the Raptors to lose.Porter is the second person to be banned by Commissioner Adam Silver for violating league rules. The other was now-former  Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling  in 2014, shortly after Silver took office.In making the announcement, Silver called Porter's actions ""blatant.""""There is nothing more important than protecting the integrity of NBA competition for our fans, our teams and everyone associated with our sport, which is why Jontay Porter's blatant violations of our gaming rules are being met with the most severe punishment,"" Silver said.The investigation started once the league learned from ""licensed sports betting operators and an organization that monitors legal betting markets"" about unusual gambling patterns surrounding Porter's performance in a game on March 20 against Sacramento. The league determined that Porter gave a bettor information about his own health status prior that game and said that another individual — known to be an NBA bettor — placed an $80,000 bet that Porter would not hit the numbers set for him in parlays through an online sports book. That bet would have won $1.1 million.Porter took himself out of that game after less than three minutes, claiming illness, none of his stats meeting the totals set in the parlay. The $80,000 bet was frozen and not paid out, the league said, and the NBA started an investigation not long afterward.<h2>The NBA has strict rules against players betting</h2>The league has partnerships and other relationships with more than two dozen gaming companies, many of whom advertise during NBA games in a variety of ways. Silver himself has been a longtime proponent of legal sports wagering, but the league has very strict rules for players and employees regarding betting.And what Porter was found to have done was in violation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, which states: ""Any Player who, directly or indirectly, wagers money or anything of value on any game or event in the Association or in the NBA G League shall, on being charged with such wagering, be given an opportunity to answer such charges after due notice, and the decision of the Commissioner shall be final, binding, and conclusive and unappealable.""Silver cautioned last week that this move was possible, saying what Porter was accused of represented ""cardinal sin"" in the NBA. Porter has not commented since the investigation began, and never played for the Raptors again — he was listed as out for all of Toronto's games for the remainder of the season citing personal reasons.<h2>The NBA found that Porter placed at least 13 bets on games</h2>The league also determined that Porter — the brother of Denver Nuggets forward Michael Porter Jr. — placed at least 13 bets on NBA games using someone else's betting account. The bets ranged from $15 to $22,000; the total wagered was $54,094 and generated a payout of $76,059, or net winnings of $21,965.Those wagers did not involve any game in which Porter played, the NBA said. But three of the wagers were multi-game parlays, including a bet where Porter — who was not playing in the games involved — wagered on the Raptors to lose. All three of those bets lost.""While legal sports betting creates transparency that helps identify suspicious or abnormal activity, this matter also raises important issues about the sufficiency of the regulatory framework currently in place, including the types of bets offered on our games and players,"" Silver said. ""Working closely with all relevant stakeholders across the industry, we will continue to work diligently to safeguard our league and game.""The 24-year-old Porter averaged 4.4 points, 3.2 rebounds and 2.3 assists in 26 games, including five starts. He also played in 11 games for Memphis in the 2020-21 season.ESPN first reported the investigation, which it said surrounded Porter's performance in games on Jan. 26 and March 20. In both games, Porter played briefly before leaving citing injury or illness. Porter played 4 minutes, 24 seconds against the Los Angeles Clippers in the first of those games, then 2:43 against Sacramento in the second game.In both of those games, Porter did not come close to hitting the prop-wager lines for points, rebounds and 3-pointers that bettors could play at some sportsbooks. For example, one set of prop wagers for Porter for the Clippers game was set at 5.5 points, 4.5 rebounds and 1.5 assists; he finished with no points, three rebounds and one assist. For the Kings game, they were around 7.5 points and 5.5 rebounds; Porter finished that game with no points and two rebounds.The league said its probe ""remains open and may result in further findings,"" and that those findings are being shared with federal prosecutors.",2024-04-17 20:19:00 PM EEST,NPR,"NBA bans Jontay Porter after gambling probe shows he shared information, bet on games",https://www.npr.org/2024/04/17/1245301982/nba-bans-jontay-porter-gambling
Juliana Kim,"Nike revealed a range of new styles and silhouettes for elite athletes last week ahead of the 2024 Olympics, but one article of clothing has raised controversy. A bodysuit that appears to be cut high on the hips is one of the options for Team USA's track and field. Athletes and fans have criticized the design, saying that the outfit looks uncomfortable and revealing. Complaints further mounted after  Citius Mag , an online magazine that covers track and field, released a side-by-side comparison of the men's and women's uniform — with critics finding the vast differences deeply problematic. In response to the criticism, Nike said female runners are not limited to the leotard and that the new line offers nearly 50 styles to choose from, including shorts. ""We showcased some of the new Olympic uniforms at the Nike On Air experience in Paris — but, as we are a few months from the Games and working with limited samples in a limited format presentation, not all looks and styles were featured,"" a Nike spokesperson said in an email.The company added that it took female athletes' comfort especially seriously, which is why it raised the neckline for tops.USA Track and Field said its athletes were consulted throughout the design process. ""Athlete options and choices were the driving force for USATF in the planning process with Nike,"" the USATF said in a statement.Sarah Hirshland, CEO of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, said she supports athletes having options. ""I think that's important. We want to make sure athletes have choices that they're comfortable in,"" she told reporters.The backlash comes less than two months after Nike was scrutinized over its  new uniforms  for Major League Baseball players, which some said looked see-through and of poor quality.  This time, Nike's designs were caught in the long-running discourse over sexism in women's sports attire. U.S. national champion distance runner Lauren Fleshman said the track and field kit specifically displayed on the mannequin lacked the professionalism that top women athletes deserve. ""Women's kits should be in service to performance, mentally and physically. If this outfit was truly beneficial to physical performance, men would wear it,"" she wrote on  Instagram .On social media, some fans asked if the mannequin outfit was for swimming events. Others expressed concern that the fit will sexualize sportswomen, given the uniforms' lack of coverage.Pole vaulting Olympic gold medalist Katie Moon said while the uniform was troubling, she is in favor of female athletes having more options rather than less when it comes to attire. ""Even if its with best of intentions, you're ultimately attacking our decision as women to wear it,"" Moon wrote on  Instagram . ""The point is we DO have the choice of what to wear, and whether we feel the best in a potato sack or a bathing suit during competitions, we should support the autonomy.Before the backlash, Nike said the uniforms were the ""most athlete-informed, data-driven and visually unified the company has ever produced."" The clothes were tailored to support a range of body types and sports disciplines while maximizing breathability, Nike Chief Innovation Officer John Hoke said in a  press release  Thursday.Nike also plans to provide custom tailoring at the games.

Brian Mann,"Officials with the world's leading sports anti-doping agency scrambled on Monday to contain a scandal involving 23 elite and Olympic swimmers from China who tested positive for a performance-enhancing drug.The scandal, which comes less than a  hundred days before the Paris Summer Games , is linked to positive doping tests collected in 2021 that  the World Anti-Doping Agency  (WADA) and Chinese officials never publicly disclosed.""We had no evidence of wrongdoing,"" said WADA President Witold Banka during a press conference with reporters that often turned combative.  ""At every stage WADA followed all due processes and diligently investigated. If we had it over again, we would do exactly the same thing.""Banka went on to describe China's athletes as ""innocent"" and ""not a doping case involving cheaters.""He said WADA had no obligation to suspend them from competition or report the case to sports officials from other countries.Critics, however, said the scandal suggests a  ""potential cover-up""  and raises troubling questions about the integrity of the international testing regime meant to  keep Olympic sport clean .""It's crushing to see that 23 Chinese swimmers had positive tests for a potent performance-enhancing drug on the eve of the 2021 Olympic Games [in Tokyo],"" said Travis Tygart, head of the  U.S. Anti-Doping Agency , known as USADA.""It's even more devastating to learn the World Anti-Doping Agency and the Chinese Anti-Doping Agency secretly, until now, swept these positives under the carpet,""  Tygart added in a statement .  WADA now acknowledges learning of positive drug tests for nearly two dozen Chinese swimmers in June 2021   ahead of the Tokyo Games.  During Monday's press conference, WADA officials said the 60 urine samples were actually conducted by Chinese sports officials months earlier at a swimming competition in January 2021. After months of delay, the Chinese presented a theory to WADA that the athletes were accidentally contaminated by a potent performance-enhancing  drug called trimetazidine, known as TMZ .Chinese officials say TMZ was allegedly found in trace amounts in the kitchen of a hotel where the swimmers were staying.<h2>China's explanation draws skepticism</h2>No explanation has been provided for how TMZ, a controlled substance, might have made its way into the kitchen or reached the athletes. WADA officials also confirmed Monday that they conducted no independent on-the-ground investigation and instead carried out their review using samples and data provided by China.They eventually accepted China's explanation that no deliberate wrong-doing occurred. In addition, WADA said the COVID pandemic complicated efforts to enter China for a fuller investigation. ""The feedback from WADA's science department was that the [accidental] contamination scenario was not only plausible, but there was no concrete element to call it into question,"" said Ross Wenzel, WADA's lead attorney, during the press conference.WADA officials say given the circumstances of the case, international doping rules did not require them to alert other competitors about the tests and investigations, nor were they required to suspend the Chinese athletes.  Despite those explanations, the case has sparked growing outrage around the world.In a statement posted on social media,  British swimmer James Guy , who won two gold medals in Tokyo and who will compete again in Paris, blasted the Chinese athletes who tested positive.""Ban them all and never compete again,""  Guy wrote on X .The head of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, meanwhile,  said in a statement the timing of these latest revelations  is disastrous for athletes.""The recent allegations of doping cast a shadow of uncertainty as we head into the [Paris] Olympic and Paralympic cycle, challenging the very foundation of what fair competition stands for,"" said USOPC CEO Sarah Hirshland.In an interview with NPR, USADA's Tygart questioned the plausibility of China's explanation that the positive TMZ tests were the result of an accidental exposure.""Maybe part of the rationale [for a cover-up] was 'Nobody's going to believe this contamination theory, so we can't follow the rules because it's a crazy theory and no one would believe it,'"" Tygart said.<h2>Another Olympics, another high-profile doping scandal</h2>Trimetazidine  used by Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva ahead of the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing, a violation that  ultimately led to Valieva receiving a four-year ban  from international competition.That case, too, involved a controversial delay in notification about Valieva's positive drug test, and threw the Beijing Games into turmoil.  Nine U.S. skaters were belatedly granted gold medals .  Two years later they are still awaiting their formal award ceremony.Critics now say WADA and the Chinese should have made the swimmers' tests known immediately to sports officials from other countries.The behind-the-scenes investigation was first made public by the  New York Times  and a German news organization ARD, which aired  a German-language television documentary about the case , and published a full list of Chinese athletes who allegedly tested positive.The list includes star swimmers Zhang Yufei and Wang Shun, who went on to win gold medals in Tokyo. Both are expected to compete again in Paris Olympic Games this summer.In an interview with the German news agency DPA , Germany's Interior Minister Nancy Faeser called for an investigation of the case.""If confirmed that Chinese swimmers were able to become Olympic champions in Tokyo despite previous evidence of doping, that would be a disaster for world sport,"" Faeser said. ""This case is a slap in the face of all innocent and honest athletes.""<h2>In the countdown to Paris, disarray among drug testers</h2>The Chinese Anti-Doping Agency, known as CHADA, also pushed back over the weekend against growing claims of wrongdoing.In a statement published by the Chinese-government's Xinhua news agency, CHADA officials said  their investigation found ""extremely low""  amounts of TMZ in Chinese swimmers.  ""WADA agreed with our conclusion after thorough review,"" the organization said. WADA,  meanwhile, condemned its critics in a fiercely worded statement  threatening legal action, calling accusations of wrong-doing ""outrageous, completely false and defamatory.""""At all times, WADA acted in good faith, according to due process and following advice from external counsel,"" the organization said. Tygart, with the United States Anti-Doping Agency, punched back  on social media , saying it is ""disappointing to see WADA stoop to threats and scare tactics when confronted with a blatant violation of the rules governing anti-doping.""<h2>New scandal, old suspicions</h2>This scandal revives questions about international sport's ability to cope with countries accused of using performance-enhancing drugs systematically to gain unfair advantages at the Olympics and in other major competitions.The International Olympic Committee has drawn criticism for allowing Russian athletes to continue competing at the Winter and Summer Games, albeit as neutrals without flying Russia's flag or playing the national anthem, despite evidence of systemic doping.Also at the Tokyo Games, questions were raised about Russian swimmer Evgeny Rylov, who won gold in the men's 200-meter backstroke. ""I don't know if [the race] was 100 percent clean,"" said U.S. swimmer Ryan Murphy, the silver medal winner,  at a press conference afterwards in 2021 , ""and that's because of things that happened over the past.""China, too, has faced on-going questions about whether its teams use performance enhancing drugs systematically.  At the 2012 Summer Games in London, then-16-year-old swimmer Ye Shiwen of China  obliterated the competition on the final lap  of the women's 400m individual medley race. Her final 50m was faster than American star Ryan Lochte's final 50m in the men's version of that same race, raising doubts about whether the performance could have been achieved without the aid of drugs.",2024-04-22 21:06:00 PM EEST,NPR,"'Ban them all.'

Rolando Arrieta,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. — Tammy Sterling had plans to go out of town this past weekend. Instead, she stayed home to attend an athletic event she'd never seen before.""I am actually watching the Olympic trials, and I'm going to see somebody that I watched today at the Paris Olympics in 2024. It's just amazing. I love it,"" Sterling said.The U.S. Olympic Team trials for canoe and kayak slalom were held Saturday and Sunday at Montgomery Whitewater, a new artificial watersports complex near downtown Montgomery. Hundreds of curious Alabamians turned out for the event.Cindy Riggins was intrigued by the caliber of athletes who had traveled to her hometown for this competition.""It looks like a fun sport. Looks very tiring — you have to definitely be in shape,"" she said.In canoe and kayak slalom, athletes race against the clock navigating through a series of red and green gates hanging above raging rapids. Points are deducted if they touch or miss any of the gates. Coaches, teammates, friends and parents ran alongside the course, encouraging and cheering the racer down to the finish line.""They chant: up up up!"" said kayaker Nik Nijhawan. ""That's because the red gates are also called up gates so it's our own variation of, go go go,"" Nijhawan said.Nijhawan, 16, is from Colorado and said he does not expect to make the Olympic team this year — ""but sometime in the next 10 years it would be amazing.""Evy Leibfarth, 20, from Bryson City, N.C., had the fastest time in both kayak and canoe slalom events and was the only athlete among the nearly 70 who competed in Montgomery to secure an Olympic spot in the women's canoe slalom. The remaining spots for Team USA will be determined in Oklahoma City in two weeks.""This weekend has been amazing for me. I'm really proud of my racing this weekend. Overall it's been great, emotional and so much fun."" said Leibfarth, who'll be competing in her second Olympics after finishing outside the top 10 in two events in Tokyo in 2020.""It's been a dream of mine to go to Paris for a really long time and I'm really stoked to make that a reality,"" Leibfarth added.Boosting the city's athletic profileLocal leaders hope an Olympic-sanctioned event like this will help the Montgomery economy and put the city on the map as a sports tourism destination.Mayor Steven L. Reed said that hosting the U.S. Olympic trials speaks to ""a pivot we want to make, to make sure that sports tourism is also a big part of what's happening here.""He said he sees a kayaking and canoeing competition of this level as a way to break down racial, economic and social barriers, particularly among kids. ""Maybe they can be the first one from Montgomery or maybe one of the first ones from Alabama to bring home a medal"" in these events, the mayor said.Montgomery Whitewater was built by the county for about $90 million and opened in July. It's the third artificial whitewater park in U.S. cities, joining facilities in Oklahoma City and Charlotte. It's part of a broader shift in the sport, with almost all high-level competitions now held on artificial courses.Three-time kayak slalom Olympian Scott Shipley, who is now a mechanical engineer, designed all three whitewater parks.""It was something I wanted to bring to America,"" Shipley said. ""It's a whole recreational thing where it's not just that 1%, but also church groups and school groups and family and friends coming out to enjoy whitewater where they are.""Bringing broader visibility to paddle sportsJedediah Hinkley, competition director for the American Canoe Association, made a half-dozen trips to the venue to make sure it was ready for the Olympic trials. He said his group and Montgomery share a goal of ""creating access to a sport that a lot of people around here have not historically had access to.""Even with the new venue, not everyone in Montgomery is ready to pick up a paddle. Nick Riggins, who watched the events with his sister Cindy, said that when he first heard about the city investing in a whitewater park near downtown he ""thought it was a hoax."""" It's interesting to watch to see how they maneuver with the kayaks and all that other kind of stuff, but not anything that I would want to do,"" Riggins said. ""There's a lot of water moving real fast and I don't want to do that.""Still, he said, he was glad the facility was open.",2024-04-15 19:44:00 PM EEST,NPR,Alabama holds its first ever U.S. Olympic trial for a sport that's little-known there,https://www.npr.org/2024/04/15/1244753507/montgomery-whitewater-alabama-canoe-kayak-olympic-trials
Scott Simon,"""It is high! It is far! It is ... gone!""John Sterling has said for the 36 years that he has narrated, more than just announced, all the home runs, balls, strikes, pick offs, pop flies, late tags, stolen bases, wins, losses, and saves that orchestrate a major league baseball game. Pitch by pitch, swing by swing.John Sterling will be honored in a pre-game ceremony at Yankee Stadium today, just before the New York Yankees play the Tampa Bay Rays. He is retiring at the age of 85.John Sterling, who grew up a Yankees fan in New York, has called 5,420 of the Yankees' regular season games, including every at-bat by Derek Jeter, the team's Hall of Fame shortstop; and every inning pitched by Mariano Rivera, their equally Hall of Famous relief pitcher. He was the voice that chronicled the team for their four World Series championships from 1996 to 2000, and then the last time they won in 2009.He became known for his home run calls.""It's a Jeter Jolt!""  he'd proclaim for stroke into the seats by Derek Jeter.  ""Bern, baby, Bern!""  he'd trumpet for Bernie Williams. When Hideki Matsui clubbed a homer, John Sterling would declare,  ""A thrilla from Godzilla!""  It was,  ""An A-Bomb from the A-Rod!""  for Alex Rodriguez, and  ""Nobody beats the Rizz!""  for Anthony Rizzo.When home run champion Aaron Judge strode to the plate, John Sterling would often intone,  ""Here come the Judge!""And on Oct. 4, 2022, when Judge struck his 62nd home run of the season, this pronouncement from John Sterling had the authority of words carved into a stone tablet:""And now Aaron Judge hits his 62nd homerun. The most home runs any American Leaguer has ever hit in a single season, this is judgement day. Case closed."" Even the Yankees have good years and bad years, and most years don't wind up in a World Series. But John Sterling's alchemy of colorful, corny, and artful play-by-play has played in the minds of people who heard his voice, night after night, year after year, for 36 years. People listened as they sat in kitchens, or drove across the Queensborough Bridge, or down Astoria Boulevard. I think of all the children who grew up hearing that voice as they slipped under the covers, but stayed wide awake, while John Sterling told them the best bed-time stories of great players in pinstripes, striking bolts of lightning in Yankee Stadium.",2024-04-20 15:00:00 PM EEST,NPR,Opinion: The voice of Yankees legends bids farewell,https://www.npr.org/2024/04/20/1245988938/opinion-the-voice-of-yankees-legends-bids-farewell
None,"The U.S. Justice Department has agreed to pay approximately $100 million to settle claims with about 100 people who say they were sexually assaulted by sports doctor Larry Nassar, a source with direct knowledge of the negotiations told The Associated Press on Wednesday. The deal has not been finalized and no money has been paid, the source said on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak before a formal announcement. An internal investigation found that FBI agents mishandled abuse allegations by women more than a year before Nassar was arrested in 2016. The settlement was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.Nassar was a Michigan State University sports doctor as well as a doctor at Indianapolis-based USA Gymnastics. He is serving decades in prison for assaulting female athletes, including medal-winning Olympic gymnasts, under the guise of treatment. Lawyers filed claims against the government, focusing on a 15-month period when FBI agents in Indianapolis and Los Angeles had knowledge of allegations against Nassar but apparently took no action, beginning in 2015. The Justice Department inspector general confirmed fundamental errors. Nassar's assaults continued until his arrest in fall 2016, authorities said. The assault survivors include decorated Olympians Simone Biles, Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney. ""I'm sorry that so many different people let you down, over and over again,"" FBI Director Christopher Wray told survivors at a Senate hearing in 2021. ""And I'm especially sorry that there were people at the FBI who had their own chance to stop this monster back in 2015 and failed."" The Michigan attorney general's office ultimately handled the assault charges against Nassar, while federal prosecutors in western Michigan filed a child sex abuse images case against him. Michigan State University, which was also accused of missing chances over many years to stop Nassar, agreed to pay $500 million to more than 300 women and girls who were assaulted. USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee made a $380 million settlement.",2024-04-18 08:10:00 AM EEST,NPR,Lawyers for Nassar assault survivors have reached $100M deal with Justice Department,https://www.npr.org/2024/04/18/1245491081/lawyers-for-nassar-assault-survivors-have-reached-100m-deal
Rachel Treisman,"Caitlin Clark won't make her WNBA debut until May 3, when the Indiana Fever — which selected her as the  first overall draft pick  last week — play their first preseason game in Texas. But Clark is already making an outsized impact on the league, which she joins as the  all-time leading scorer  in college basketball history. Her dominance is credited with  bringing more attention  to the Iowa Hawkeyes and women's basketball writ large — and the "" Caitlin Clark Effect "" seems poised to continue at the professional level, if early numbers are any indication. ""When Caitlin Clark declared for the WNBA draft, we instantly saw the Indiana Fever's average ticket price double,"" Laura Correnti, founder and CEO of Deep Blue Sports + Entertainment,  told  Morning Edition  earlier this month. ""We're also hearing from some of the different teams across the WNBA that they are also seeing bumps in ticket sales and interest in terms of near sellout for when Caitlin Clark comes to town.""Clark's Fever jersey  sold out in most sizes  on the Fanatics website within an hour of her being selected in Monday's draft, in what the retailer says is now the  top-selling jersey  for any draft pick ever. And the  WNBA plans to show  36 of the Fever's 40 regular season games on its national broadcast and streaming partners, compared to  22 last year , when it finished  10th of 12 teams . It hasn't had a winning season since 2015. Demand to see Clark in action has sent ticket prices skyrocketing and prompted teams in several cities to move their games to bigger venues. Last week, the Washington Mystics announced that they will be relocating their June 7 game against the Indiana Fever from their 4,200-seat home stadium in D.C. to the 20,000 plus-capacity Capital One Arena, citing "" unprecedented demand ."" It's the second team to announce such a move in anticipation of Fever frenzy. The  Las Vegas Aces  have said they will move their July 2 game against Indiana from Michelob Ultra Arena to T-Mobile Arena to accommodate some 8,000 additional fans. And in Chicago — where the Sky picked up some high draft picks including Angel Reese and Kamilla Cardoso — fans are  petitioning  the team to relocate their June and August games against the Fever from the Wintrust Arena to the larger United Center.  ""Larger quantities of less expensive seats would allow both Caitlin Clark fans and Chicago Sky fans to enjoy a great game at the incredible United Center,"" reads the online petition, which had over 700 signatures as of Monday morning.The Indiana Fever accounts for all of the WNBA's top 10 most expensive regular season games this year, according to data from the ticket site Gametime  reported by  Forbes . It says the most expensive WNBA game on the secondary market is Indiana's July 14 game against the Minnesota Lynx, with a median ticket price of $615. The Fever's June games against the Chicago Sky ($600) and Washington Mystics ($530) also made the list. Tickets to the Fever's first preseason game, against the Dallas Wings in Arlington, Texas, ranged from $110 to $1,100. CEO Greg Bibb  told WFAA  that the Wings scheduled that game well before the draft, anticipating Clark would enter and be picked first. ""We have seen incremental gains in business growth every year since 2020, and what's happened in the NCAA has been an accelerant to that growth,"" Bibb told the outlet. ""We structured our ticket sales accordingly and waited later in the calendar year to go on sale with them to create a pent-up demand post-draft."" Resale prices for Fever tickets are going up too, with Vivid Seats reporting they have  nearly tripled  since last season.Clark's financial boost to the WNBA has amplified the spotlight on its  longstanding pay gap  with the NBA. That gap is the result of the leagues' differences in revenue, season length and union contracts, among other factors. As a rookie,  Clark's base salary  will be $76,535 this year and just over $338,000 for four years — far lower than that of her male counterparts and at least  some NBA mascots . In contrast, Victor Wembanyama, the 2023 first-round draft pick in the NBA, started on the San Antonio Spurs with a base salary of over $12 million, as part of a  four-year contract  exceeding $55 million. That disparity has drawn  renewed attention  and outrage from many viewers. Even  President Biden weighed in , tweeting last week that ""right now we're seeing that even if you're the best, women are not paid their fair share.""But Clark — whose name, image and likeness are  valued at over $3 million  — is expected to  make money in other ways , including  endorsement deals  with companies including State Farm and Gatorade. And  The Athletic  reported last week  that Clark is nearing a deal with Nike worth over $20 million that includes a signature shoe.

None,"The Justice Department says  it will pay $138.7 million to settle 139 claims  arising from sexual abuse committed by former physician and USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar. The settlement agreements will resolve the  claims lodged against the United States  that alleged the FBI failed to conduct an adequate investigation of Nassar's conduct. It also will likely put an end to  years of efforts by some of the gymnasts  including  Olympic gold medalists Simone Biles , Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney to hold federal authorities accountable for not adequately investigating the dozens of allegations.Nassar was a Michigan State University sports doctor as well as a lead physician  for Indianapolis-based USA Gymnastics. For nearly two decades, he sexually abused hundreds of victims, including elite and gold medal-winning Olympic gymnasts, under the guise of performing medical treatments.He was arrested by Michigan authorities in 2016 and later sentenced to serve decades in prison. In 2021, the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General issued a report critical of the FBI's response to - and - investigation of allegations against Nassar.The  Justice Department probe  found the FBI mishandled the case against Nassar and failed to respond to the allegations with ""the utmost seriousness and urgency that they deserved and required."" The DOJ also  said in its July 2021 report  that the FBI made numerous and fundamental errors and violated multiple policies along the way. The Justice Department had previously said it  would not charge the FBI agents  who initially mishandled the Nassar case. In 2021, USA Gymnastics  agreed to pay hundreds of the female  survivors $380 million to settle their claims.In the DOJ's statement, Acting Associate Attorney General Benjamin Mizer said, ""While these settlements won't undo the harm Nassar inflicted, our hope is that they will help give the victims of his crimes some of the critical support they need to continue healing.""Nassar has been assaulted several times in prison including  multiple stabbings  last year.",2024-04-23 21:03:00 PM EEST,NPR,Justice Department pays $138 million over FBI failures in Larry Nassar case,https://www.npr.org/2024/04/23/1246647531/doj-settles-larry-nassar-usa-gymnastics-sexual-assault-victims
