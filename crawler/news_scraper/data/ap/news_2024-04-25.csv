Ed White,"DETROIT (AP) — A state investigator testified Wednesday that he considers former President Donald Trump and his White House chief of staff to be uncharged co-conspirators in a scheme to claim that he won Michigan in the 2020 election, despite Democrat Joe Biden’s clear victory.Trump and Mark Meadows were among the names mentioned during the cross-examination of Howard Shock, whose work led to forgery charges against more than a dozen people in Michigan. A judge in the state capital is holding hearings to determine if there is enough evidence to order a trial.A defense attorney, Duane Silverthorn, offered a series of names and asked Shock if they were “unindicted co-conspirators,” which means they weren’t charged but could have been part of an alleged plot to put Michigan’s electoral votes in Trump’s column.Prosecutors from the attorney general’s office didn’t object. Shock responded “yes” to Trump, Meadows, Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani and some high-ranking state Republicans.Silverthorn then moved on to other questions.“I’m surprised the question was even answered,” said Detroit-area attorney Margaret Raben, former head of a statewide association of defense lawyers.“It’s irrelevant — legally and factually irrelevant — that there are other people who could have been charged or should have been charged,” said Raben, who is not involved in the case.Meadows’ lawyer, George Terwilliger, had a similar reaction when reached by The Associated Press. He declined further comment. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung referred to the Michigan case as an “ongoing witch hunt,” and Giuliani political adviser Ted Goodman said the former New York mayor was proud to stand up for people with concerns about the election.In Georgia, Trump, Giuliani and others are charged with conspiracy related to the filing of a Republican elector certificate in that state following the 2020 election. Meadows is also charged in Georgia but not in relation to the elector scheme. They have pleaded not guilty.An indictment by Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith charging Trump with plotting to overturn the election also accuses the former president in a fake elector scheme and identifies six unnamed and unindicted co-conspirators, including Giuliani.In Michigan, authorities said more than a dozen Republicans sent certificates to Congress falsely declaring they were electors and that Trump was the winner of the 2020 election in the state, despite results showing he had lost. Attorney General Dana Nessel said the scheme was hatched in the basement of the state Republican Party headquarters.Follow Ed White at https://twitter.com/edwritez",2024-04-25 00:21:31 AM EEST,NPR,"Investigator says Trump, allies were uncharged co-conspirators in plot to overturn Michigan election",https://apnews.com/article/michigan-fake-electors-2020-election-1b65f10b04a7baedebfd5138ed5997e9
Eric Tucker,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Lawyers for an American believed to be held by the Taliban for nearly two years are asking a United Nations human rights investigator to intervene, citing what they say is cruel and inhumane treatment.Ryan Corbett was abducted Aug. 10, 2022, after returning to Afghanistan, where he and his family had been living at the time of the collapse of the U.S.-based government there a year earlier. He arrived on a valid 12-month visa to pay and train staff as part of a business venture he led aimed at promoting Afghanistan’s private sector through consulting services and lending.Corbett has since been shuttled between multiple prisons, though his lawyers say he has not been seen since last December by anyone other than the people with whom he was detained.In a petition sent Thursday, lawyers for Corbett say that he’s been threatened with physical violence and torture and has been malnourished and deprived of medical care. He’s been held in solitary confinement, including in a basement cell with almost no sunlight and exercise, and his physical and mental health have significantly deteriorated, the lawyers say.Corbett has been able to speak with his family by phone five times since his arrest, including last month. His family has not been able to see him — his only visits have been two check-ins from a third-party government — and their characterizations of his mistreatment are based on accounts from recently released prisoners who were with him and his openly dispirited tone in conversations.“During Mr. Corbett’s most recent call with his wife and children, Mr. Corbett indicated that the mental torture and anguish have caused him to lose all hope,” said the petition, signed by the Corbett family attorneys, Ryan Fayhee and Kate Gibson.The petition is addressed to Alice Edwards, an independent human rights investigator and the special rapporteur for torture in the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights at the U.N. It asks Edwards, who was appointed by the U.N. Human Rights Council, to “urgently reach out to the Taliban to secure Mr. Corbett’s immediate release and freedom from torture, as guaranteed by international law.”“This situation is just dragging on, and I’m increasingly concerned and taking steps that I hope will make a difference and help the situation — just increasingly concerned and panicking about Ryan’s deteriorating health and physical and mental health,” Corbett’s wife, Anna, said in an interview. “And that was leading me to take this next step.”The U.S. government is separately working to get Corbett home and has designated him as wrongfully detained. A State Department spokesman told reporters last month that officials had continually pressed for Corbett’s release and were “using every lever we can to try to bring Ryan and these other wrongfully detained Americans home from Afghanistan.”A spokesperson for the Interior Ministry in Afghanistan said this week that it had no knowledge of Corbett’s case.Corbett, of Dansville, New York, first visited Afghanistan in 2006 and relocated there with his family in 2010, supervising several non-governmental organizations.The family was forced to leave Afghanistan in August 2021 when the Taliban captured Kabul, but he returned the following January so that he could renew his business visa. Given the instability on the ground, the family discussed the trip and “we were all pretty nervous,” Corbett’s wife said.But after that first uneventful trip, he returned to the country in August 2022 to train and pay his staff and resume a business venture that involved consulting services, microfinance lending and evaluating international development projects.While on a trip to the northern Jawzjan province, Corbett and a Western colleague were confronted by armed members of the Taliban and were taken first to a police station and later to an underground prison.Anna Corbett said that when she learned her husband had been taken to a police station, she got “really scared” but that he was optimistic the situation would be quickly resolved.That, however, did not happen, and Anna Corbett, who has three teenage children and makes regular trips to Washington, said she’s trying to advocate as forcefully as she can while not letting “anxiety take over.”“I feel like it’s the uncertainty of all of it that just is so difficult because you just don’t know what’s going to come at you — what call, what news,” she said. “And I’m worried about Ryan and the effect of the trauma on him and then also on my kids, just what they’re experiencing. I’ve tried to protect them the best I could, but this is so difficult.”Associated Press writer Riazat Butt in Kabul, Afghanistan, contributed to this report.",2024-04-25 13:30:22 PM EEST,NPR,Family of American man believed to be held by Taliban asks the UN torture investigator for help,https://apnews.com/article/taliban-detained-american-un-investigation-afghanistan-641ffd0b1664f8512d33008137e49244
Sophie Austin,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Arizona doctors could give their patients abortions in California under a proposal announced Wednesday by Gov. Gavin Newsom to circumvent a ban on nearly all abortions in the neighboring state.It would apply only to doctors licensed in good standing in Arizona and their patients, and last only through the end of November. Arizona’s 1864 law banning all abortions except if the woman’s life is in jeopardy would take effect June 8, and Newsom said protecting access to abortions is “just about basic decency” and “respect for women and girls.”“This Arizona law is the first border-state law that will directly impact the state of California,” the Democratic governor said. “Rather than just acknowledging that fate and future, we’re trying to get ahead of this law.”Newsom joined the California Legislative Women’s Caucus and advocates to announce the proposal. Lawmakers called the Arizona law “draconian” and said California had an obligation to get involved. The bill would need to pass by a two-thirds vote in each house of the Legislature before reaching Newsom’s desk. After he signs it, it would go into effect immediately.Dr. Tanya Spirtos, a gynecologist and president of the California Medical Association, said it is unfortunate that Arizona abortion patients will have to travel out of state, but she’s proud to see California step in to assist them.“All personal medical decisions, including those around abortion, should be made by patients in consultation with their health care providers,” Spirtos said. “By banning virtually all abortions in the state, the ruling will put physicians in harm’s way for simply providing often lifesaving medical care to their patients.”The Arizona Supreme Court cleared the way earlier this month for the near-total ban to move forward. Fifteen states have banned abortion at all stages of pregnancy, though Arizona’s Legislature is expected to repeal the 160-year-old law, setting the state up for a 15-week limit. California law generally allows the procedure up to the point of fetal viability, which is around 24 weeks.About 11,500 abortions were reported in Arizona in 2022, down from nearly 14,000 in the previous year, according to a report from the Arizona Department of Health Services.Democratic Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs’ office declined to comment on the California bill.Newsom should focus on “very real problems” in his own state, said Arizona House Speaker Ben Toma, a Republican who voted against repealing the near-total ban.Arizona state Sen. Eva Burch, a Democrat, said the California proposal is “a step in the right direction,” but she hopes it is not necessary and that Arizona repeals the ban. Burch has had two abortions to terminate nonviable pregnancies.“It’s unreasonable for us to expect patients to have to travel out of state for this kind of care,” Burch said. “In circumstances like mine, where I was having a failed miscarriage, a stalled miscarriage, traveling wouldn’t be appropriate.”While abortion access in California has never been under serious threat, Newsom — widely seen as a potential presidential candidate beyond 2024 — has made defending that access a priority of his administration.Newsom pushed for abortion access to be enshrined in the California Constitution. He approved $20 million of taxpayer money to help pay for women in other states to come to California for abortions, and he signed dozens of laws aimed at making it harder for other states to investigate women who do so, including banning social media companies from complying with subpoenas or warrants.In 2022, months after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, California launched a publicly funded website to promote the state’s abortion services, including information about financial help for travel expenses and letting teenagers in other states know that California does not require them to have their parents’ permission to get an abortion in the state.It’s also become a chief talking point in Newsom’s role as a top surrogate of President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign. Using money left over from his own 2022 reelection campaign, Newsom started a political action committee he calls the “ Campaign for Democracy ” that has paid for billboards and TV ads in Republican-led states to criticize their leaders’ attempts to outlaw or restrict access to abortions. In February he launched ads in multiple states to criticize proposals there that aimed to prohibit out-of-state travel for abortions.Newsom’s campaign on Sunday released a dramatic ad in Alabama depicting a young woman trying to leave the state who is stopped by a police officer who demands that she take a pregnancy test. The ad ran after an Alabama lawmaker introduced a bill to make it a crime to help someone under 18 get an abortion without telling their parents or guardians. It has not been voted on in committee.Associated Press writers Adam Beam in Sacramento and Anita Snow and Jacques Billeaud in Phoenix contributed.Austin is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Jim Salter,"ST. LOUIS (AP) — A federal investigation has concluded that a young Black man died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound inside a rural Missouri home, not at the hands of the white homeowner who had a history of racist social media postings, an FBI official told The Associated Press Wednesday.Derontae Martin, 19, was at a prom party on April 25, 2021, when he died in an attic closet. The death was initially ruled a suicide. Relatives of Martin and others questioned that finding, and a jury at a coroner’s inquest later ruled that Martin died by “violence,” prompting the FBI investigation.Chris Crocker, acting special agent in charge of the FBI’s St. Louis division, said an extensive investigation concluded “that this was a self-inflicted gunshot wound, not a homicide or a hate crime.” Relatives were informed of the finding in December, Crocker said.Martin’s mother, Ericka Lotts, said in a text that she remains convinced that her son was the victim of a homicide.EDITOR’S NOTE — This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.orgMartin was originally from the St. Louis area, but his family moved to Park Hills, a town of 8,500 residents about 60 miles (97 kilometers) southwest of St. Louis, when he was a child. Though that area of Missouri is about 95% white, Martin was popular and happy, Ericka Lotts has said.Martin was a star defensive tackle and earned a scholarship to a small out-of-state college. He graduated from high school in 2020 but needed to bring up his entrance exam score before he could go to college. Ericka Lotts had relocated back to the St. Louis area, and Martin was living with her.On the night of April 24, 2021, Martin was back in the Park Hills area. He attended the prom party of a young woman, a friend of a friend, at a home near Fredericktown, 27 miles (43 kilometers) south of Park Hills.The home was owned by a man who in Facebook postings mocked foreign accents and defended the Confederate flag. He posted a meme showing a hand flipping the finger. It read: “Here’s my apology for being white.” Because the man is not charged with a crime, The Associated Press is not naming him.Deputies and EMTs were called to the home at 3:01 a.m. on April 25, 2021. They found Martin in the attic, dead. Madison County Sheriff Katie McCutcheon said an initial autopsy indicated Martin died of a self-inflicted gunshot. The Missouri State Highway Patrol was asked to investigate, and it concurred.About 100 racial injustice activists marched in Fredericktown shortly after Martin’s death. Gray said at the time that counter-protesters tossed two nooses at protesters and yelled racial slurs. That area of Missouri was home to Frank Ancona, a Missouri Ku Klux Klan leader shot to death by his wife in 2017.A coroner’s inquest jury was convened in July 2021. The AP obtained audio of the testimony through an open records request. Zachary Graham testified that he saw Martin shoot himself.Others said Martin had been acting paranoid and aloof. Martin had methamphetamine in his system — enough to cause paranoia and irrational thinking — according to a toxicology report cited by Dr. Russell Deidiker, who performed the autopsy.But Phillip Lawler testified that the homeowner told him weeks after the shooting that he killed Martin. “He just told me he didn’t like Black people” and used a racial slur, Lawler testified.The homeowner, at the inquest, denied ever saying anything like that. He testified that he was at the party and on the main floor of the home with others when the shot was heard, sending people scattering. Some of the young people, in testimony, backed up his account.Crocker, in a phone interview with the AP, said evidence showed that Martin had meth levels in his body “consistent with levels that often lead to extreme paranoia and sometimes even death.” He told others at the party he was worried that a gang member was after him, the investigation found. Someone gave him a gun for protection.Martin shot himself “in the presence of a friend of his who was trying to talk him out of doing it,” Crocker said.Family members had said evidence didn’t match suicide, but Crocker said the wound was consistent with being self-inflicted.FBI officials met with Martin’s family in December to inform them of the findings. “We made sure to give them a whole understanding of the steps we took to reach this conclusion,” Crocker said.The U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division provided two attorneys to help with the investigation, Crocker said. An FBI agent who specializes in hate crimes was assigned to the investigation.“We really took extraordinary steps in this case to make sure we reached the right conclusion,” Crocker said.",2024-04-25 05:40:36 AM EEST,NPR,"2021 death of young Black man at rural Missouri home was self-inflicted, FBI tells AP",https://apnews.com/article/black-teenagers-death-missouri-no-charges-6c6753efad18150cd7868e81ba48044b
Mike Schneider,"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — For the first time in more than a year, the monthly board meeting of Walt Disney World’s governing district on Wednesday was back to being what many municipal government forums often are — boring.There were no rants against Disney by the board’s chairman nor demands by local opponents for board members appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis to resign immediately. Instead, board members approved contracts for the installation of pipelines for chilled water, sediment removal, the replacement of a wastewater lift pump and the removal of compost waste.What made this meeting different from most during the past year or so was that it came a month after Disney and DeSantis’ board appointees reached a deal to end their state court lawsuits over DeSantis’ takeover of the district. The district provides municipal services such as firefighting, planning and mosquito control, among other things, for the theme park resort.“We’re doing the people’s business,” said Charbel Barakat, the board’s vice chair.Not even a group of Disney supporters who regularly speak out against DeSantis’ board appointees bothered to show up during the public comment period on Wednesday.Until last year’s takeover of the governing district, it had been controlled for the entirety of its five decades by Disney supporters.The takeover by DeSantis and the Republican-led Legislature was sparked by Disney’s opposition to Florida’s so-called Don’t Say Gay law, which bans classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades. DeSantis championed the 2022 law and repeatedly took shots at Disney in speeches until he suspended his presidential campaign.Lawsuits in federal and state courts followed. The state lawsuits have been dismissed, and the federal lawsuit is on hold pending further negotiations over agreements between Disney and the DeSantis appointees.During Wednesday’s board meeting, the only reference to the lawsuits was a housekeeping matter that resulted from the deal. Board members approved an amendment to a labor services agreement, shortening it to 2028 instead of 2032.Follow Mike Schneider on X, formerly known as Twitter: @MikeSchneiderAP.",2024-04-24 20:17:11 PM EEST,NPR,"With lawsuits in rearview mirror, Disney World government gets back to being boring",https://apnews.com/article/disney-world-desantis-florida-a7aeecb2da8157738699137767adcc0a
None,"TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — U.S. Rep. Donald Payne Jr., a New Jersey Democrat and a member of the Congressional Black Caucus who replaced his father in the seat, died Wednesday after a heart attack this month that left him hospitalized, officials said. He was 65.Gov. Phil Murphy called his fellow Democrat a “steadfast champion for the people of New Jersey” in a statement confirming Payne’s death.Payne served for 12 years in the Newark-area seat his father had held for more than two decades. Representing a heavily Democratic and majority Black district, Payne drew strong marks from liberal organizations for his voting record.“With his signature bowtie, big heart, and tenacious spirit, Donald embodied the very best of public service,” Murphy said. “As a former union worker and toll collector, he deeply understood the struggles our working families face, and he fought valiantly to serve their needs, every single day.”New Jersey’s Democratic Party chair, LeRoy Jones Jr., called Payne a “towering figure in both our party and our community.”The Congressional Black Caucus said Payne would be remembered for his kindness and generosity and called him an advocate for progressive causes including making college tuition free, expanding voting rights and fighting climate change.Payne had previously served as City Council president in Newark, New Jersey’s largest city, and on the Essex County Board of Commissioners.Payne’s office had said his heart attack was connected to complications from diabetes. Payne’s father, Donald Milford Payne, held the congressional seat before him. When the elder Payne died in 2012, the younger ran successfully in a special election to succeed him.Payne had won reelection six times since. The district covers parts of Newark and its heavily populated suburbs.Murphy’s office declined to comment Wednesday on the governor’s plans to order a special election to fill the rest of Payne’s current term, which ends Jan. 3, 2025.Payne already filed paperwork by the March deadline to run for reelection and is to appear uncontested on the June 4 primary ballot. Should he remain on the primary ballot and win the nomination, Democratic Party committee members in his district could choose a replacement candidate to run in the November general election.The district is likely to remain in Democratic hands, with registered Democrats outnumbering Republicans there more than 6 to 1.A New Jersey colleague, Democratic U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone, called Payne a “truly great public servant” who liked to call him “Uncle Frank” and had fought to raise awareness for diabetes and colorectal cancer prevention and to replace lead pipes in Newark.Another colleague, Democratic U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, of Mississippi, called Payne a “thoughtful legislator, a dear friend, and a man of such a kind and affable nature that he was well-liked and respected” by both Democrats and Republicans.“Most importantly, he was a devoted family man, and it was this role that drove his passion for the policies he pursued,” Thompson said.As a member of the Committee on Homeland Security, Payne made school security a priority, helping to establish a School Safety Task Force at the Department of Homeland Security and pressing for federal agencies to take extra precautions for children and schools during emergencies, Thompson said.“He leaves behind an important legacy through his congressional service: making children safer. In his honor, we will continue that legacy,” Thompson said.Payne’s survivors include his wife, Beatrice, and their three children, Murphy said.",2024-04-24 22:22:15 PM EEST,NPR,"US Rep.

"Larry Neumeister,Jim Mustian,Joshua Goodman","NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge Wednesday sentenced a longtime U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent to four years in prison for leaking DEA intelligence to defense lawyers in a $100,000 bribery scheme that prosecutors said jeopardized drug cases and the lives of confidential informants.John Costanzo Jr. was found guilty last year of bribery and honest-services wire fraud, joining a growing list of DEA agents convicted of federal crimes. Another former DEA supervisor, Manny Recio, is scheduled to be sentenced next month in the same case.U.S. District Court Judge Paul Oetken, in handing down his sentence, noted that the 49-year-old Costanzo was “especially culpable” as a supervisor because he “knew what he was doing was wrong.”Costanzo, addressing the judge before sentencing, expressed regret for his actions. “This is my cross to bear,” he said. “I will try to find a silver lining in all of this.”Prosecutors urged the judge to sentence Costanzo to at least seven years behind bars, saying he abused the tradecraft he mastered as a narcotics investigator steeped in the world of money laundering. He worked in supervisory roles in Miami and later at DEA headquarters outside Washington, D.C.“Costanzo acted purely out of greed,” prosecutors wrote in court papers. “He used his network, connections and skills to hold himself above the law and make money for leaking law enforcement secrets, undermining everything he purported to stand for.”Much of the case turned on text messages and wiretapped phone calls between Costanzo and Recio, who remained close after Recio retired from DEA in 2018 and began working as a private investigator for Miami defense lawyers.Prosecutors allege that attorneys David Macey and Luis Guerra bankrolled the bribery scheme and used the leaked information to approach new clients facing federal drug charges. Macey and Guerra have not been charged but prosecutors in January asked the court for permission to access normally privileged communications between Recio and the attorneys as part of what they described as an “ongoing” investigation.The DEA did not respond to a request for comment. Costanzo’s sentencing came less than two weeks after a federal jury in Buffalo, New York, convicted another veteran DEA agent of obstruction of justice and lying to federal agents in a sprawling corruption case.Over the course of a year, Recio repeatedly asked Costanzo to query names in a confidential DEA database to keep abreast of federal investigations that would interest his new employers. The two also discussed the timing of high-profile arrests and the exact date in 2019 when prosecutors planned to bring charges against businessman Alex Saab, a top criminal target in Venezuela and suspected bag man for the country’s president, Nicolas Maduro.In exchange, prosecutors said, Recio secretly funneled bribes to Costanzo, including plane tickets and a $50,000 down payment on a condo in suburban Coral Gables.The conspiracy relied on middlemen, including Costanzo’s father, himself a retired and decorated DEA agent who prosecutors said lied to the FBI. Prosecutors said Costanzo and Recio also used sham invoices and a company listing its address as a UPS store to disguise the bribe payments while deleting hundreds of messages and calls to a burner phone.In requesting a sentence of probation, Costanzo obtained letters of support from several former colleagues, including three current DEA agents and supervisors who described him as a dedicated public servant, generous friend and expert in illicit finance.Costanzo’s attorney said his client’s only ambition was to follow in the footsteps of his father, John Costanzo Sr., a retired DEA agent who served for years in Italy and who is now battling pancreatic cancer.“Not being present for his hero’s waning days and final months would break John forever,” defense lawyer Marc Mukasey argued in a pre-sentencing memo. “That is a punishment he does not deserve.”Prosecutors, however, painted a less charitable view of the father-son relationship, pointing to the elder Costanzo’s role as a conduit for a $50,000 bribe payment that was used to purchase a Miami townhouse.“Let this be a message to all public officials who are tempted to profit illegally from their service — there will be serious consequences,” Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said.Mustian reported from Natchitoches, Louisiana, Goodman from Miami.",2024-04-24 21:02:42 PM EEST,NPR,Veteran DEA agent sentenced to 4 years for leaking intelligence in Miami bribery conspiracy,https://apnews.com/article/dea-corruption-drugs-cocaine-narcotics-50f4fb2a37e3ddf14c2c98c463c00cf3
"Cathy Bussewitz,Mae Anderson","NEW YORK (AP) — For millions of American workers, the federal government took two actions this week that could bestow potentially far-reaching benefits.In one move, the Federal Trade Commission voted to ban noncompete agreements, which bar millions of workers from leaving their employers to join a competitor or start a rival business for a specific period of time. The FTC’s move, which is already being challenged in court, would mean that such employees could apply for jobs they weren’t previously eligible to seek.In a second move, the Biden administration finalized a rule that will make millions more salaried workers eligible for overtime pay. The rule significantly raises the salary level that workers could earn and still qualify for overtime.The new rules don’t take effect immediately. And they won’t benefit everyone. So what exactly would these rules mean for America’s workers?Noncompete agreements, which employers have deployed with greater frequency in recent years, limit an employee’s ability to jump ship for a rival company or start a competing business for a stated period of time. The idea is to prevent employees from taking a company’s trade secrets, job leads or sales relationships to a direct competitor, who could immediately capitalize on them.Many industries use noncompete agreements, often among their salespeople, said Paul Lopez, managing partner at Tripp Scott, a Florida law firm that has handled more than 100 cases involving noncompete clauses.“They’re the ones out there generating leads and sales,” Lopez said. “The last thing you as a business will want is for that person to go over to your competition and do the same thing.”People may assume that noncompete agreements apply only to high-level executives in the technology or finance industries. But many lower-level workers are subject to the restrictions as well. The rules vary by state.In Florida, one medical sales worker was barred by his employer from joining a competitor for 10 years — and once he left his job, was unemployed for more than five years, said Stefanie Camfield, assistant general counsel with Engage PEO, a Florida company that handles human resources for small and medium-sized businesses.“He was able to find another sales position in a completely different industry,” Camfield said. “But the learning curve was there, so he wasn’t making the same amount of money.”In another case, a company in the optical industry that had hired a sales associate was informed by his former employer that it intended to enforce a noncompete agreement. So the optical company terminated the employee, Camfield said.“They thought they had a qualified sales associate hired and ready to get to work, and all of a sudden now they’re back to square one.”Some view noncompete agreements as harmful and unfair to workers by limiting their mobility. Career opportunities are often more attractive outside an employee’s current workplace. And with restrictions on the type of work they can do for a competitor, it can be hard to shift into a more suitable or lucrative position.Many hiring managers, after all, most value job candidates who already have a certain level of experience in the same industry.“A noncompete would unilaterally ban someone from getting exactly the kind of job that it’s reasonable to want,” said Jennifer Tosti-Kharas, a professor of organizational behavior at Babson College in Massachusetts. “To cut people off from that is overly paternalistic. It’s using a really blunt instrument to limit people’s mobility, when in reality there are other legal mechanisms to prevent trade secrets being disclosed.”People are sometimes surprised to learn that they’re bound by such an agreement. They might not even find out until after they’ve left for a new job, and their former employer intervenes and causes them to be fired.“When you join a company, you’re so focused on the opportunity in front of you, you might not be thinking about what’s that next jump,” Tosti-Kharas said.Experts suggest that employees consult their human resources department about any noncompete agreements that might exist. If a workplace doesn’t have an HR department, an employee should ask a lawyer for the company.There are still laws on the books that protect companies’ trade secrets. The FTC decision doesn’t change that.And the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has already filed a lawsuit against the Federal Trade Commission, calling its decision a dangerous precedent for government micromanagement of business. Lawsuits could delay any implementation of the FTC’s new rule, potentially for years.Starting July 1, employers of all sizes will be required pay overtime — time and a half salary after 40 hours a week — to salaried workers who make less than $43,888 a year in certain executive, administrative and professional roles. That cap will then rise to $58,656 by the start of 2025. Previously, the cap was $35,568.The Labor Department estimates that 4 million salaried workers who weren’t previously eligible will qualify. Some occupations, though, including teachers, doctors and lawyers are not eligible for overtime pay and thus are not affected by the change. And some states, like California and New York, already have salary thresholds that exceed the federal level.Predictably, groups that represent companies have lined up against the new rule. Conversely, worker groups are applauding it as a necessary and long-overdue change.The National Retail Federation argued that the new rules “curtail retailers’ ability to offer the most flexible, generous and tailored benefits packages to lower-level exempt employees across the industry.”It also asserted that the new rules don’t give employers adequate time to make the changes needed. And it complained that the inclusion of automatic increases “exceeds the Department’s legal authority and oversteps longstanding Fair Labor Standards Act and Administrative Procedure Act principles.”On the social media site X, the AFL-CIO labor organization said the rules will “restore and extend overtime protections for hard-working Americans.”Almost certainly so. A 2016 effort by the Obama administration was scuttled in court just days before it was set to take effect. Because the new overtime rules won’t take effect until July 1, groups have time to study the ruling before mounting a challenge.“I would expect there will be some legal challenges,” said Ted Hollis, a partner at the law firm Quarles & Brady. “When the Obama administration published its proposed rule in 2016, that was almost immediately challenged in court.”Companies of all sizes will have to reclassify workers who will now qualify for overtime pay — and make sure they track hours and pay them properly.Another option is to raise employees’ salaries so they would remain exempt from overtime. But employers should keep in mind that two more increases are coming under the new timetable.They’ll also have to determine how they will budget for the extra pay for overtime. Small businesses will have the toughest time.“Some are going to have to cut workers,” Hollis said. “Others will have to cut hours from existing workers.“Some are going to have to raise prices, and some probably won’t be able to figure out a way to make it economically work and wind up having to shut down, unfortunately.”",2024-04-25 01:13:03 AM EEST,NPR,How US changes to ‘noncompete’ agreements and overtime pay could affect workers,https://apnews.com/article/noncompete-agreement-overtime-workers-employers-jobs-career-biden-3d9206f9c6bca78477379d5768d47618
Steve Karnowski,"ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — A Republican attempt to expedite an ethics investigation of a Democratic Minnesota state senator who’s facing a felony burglary charge failed on a tie vote Wednesday.Sen. Nicole Mitchell was absent as the Senate met for the first time since her arrest early Monday at her estranged stepmother’s home in Detroit Lakes. Mitchell told police she broke into the northwest Minnesota home because her stepmother refused to give her items of sentimental value from her late father including his ashes, according to a criminal complaint.Mitchell was charged Tuesday with one count of first-degree burglary and released after a day in jail.Mitchell’s arrest has complicated the remainder of the 2024 legislative session because Senate Democrats hold just a one-seat majority. Senate Republican Minority Leader Mark Johnson, of East Grand Forks, who has called on Mitchell to resign, said several major bills in the pipeline are likely to be dependent on her vote.“How can Minnesotans trust that?” he asked during the floor debate.Democratic Majority Leader Erin Murphy, of St. Paul, told reporters that Mitchell, who is from Woodbury, will be allowed to vote remotely as the legislative and legal process plays out. Because of the turmoil, however, Democratic leaders put several bills on hold that were due for floor votes Wednesday and Thursday.Her attorney said Mitchell’s dispute with her stepmother arose out of a “fractured relationship” between the two that has been aggravated by age-related issues. In a Facebook post, Mitchell denied stealing. Her attorney has advised her not to resign.Senate Republicans filed an ethics complaint against Mitchell before the Senate convened Wednesday, then forced a vote on a motion to immediately launch the investigation and consideration of her expulsion. Under normal Senate rules, it could take 30 days just to start the process, which would delay any action until after the legislative session, which must end by May 20.“Senators must be held to the highest standard of ethical conduct,” GOP Sen. Eric Lucero, of St. Michael, told his colleagues. “Public trust has been violated. We must have a swift examination of this serious felony charge to ensure the integrity of this institution and the state of Minnesota is upheld.”The ethics complaint quotes extensively from Mitchell’s charging papers, including her comment to the arresting officer, “I know I did something bad.”But Democratic Sen. Nick Frentz, of North Mankato, told them Mitchell is entitled to due process and the presumption of innocence. He said other lawmakers charged with crimes in recent years were allowed to go through the legal process.Mitchell’s desk was empty for the debate, which ended in a 33-33 vote.Murphy said a timeline for considering the GOP ethics complaint has yet to be decided.But the process is designed to be difficult. The Senate ethics panel is made up of two Democrats and two Republicans, and any vote to expel a senator would require a two-thirds majority.Murphy told reporters she had spoken to Mitchell only briefly, right after her release from jail on Monday. She said they focused on her well-being and her children..“This is obviously a very tough and challenging situation for this institution,” Murphy said. “Senator Mitchell is ... going to have to have a number of difficult conversations with her family, with the people who sent her here to represent them, and with her colleagues.”",2024-04-25 00:40:57 AM EEST,NPR,Attempt to expedite ethics probe of Minnesota state senator charged with burglary fails on tie vote,https://apnews.com/article/minnesota-senator-burglary-charge-arrest-legislature-b99ec6a9ed3bedc76cc4e79f934476d9
None,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — The University of Wisconsin-La Crosse’s top official has taken the first steps toward removing a faculty member who was earlier fired from his job as chancellor over his fledgling porn career.The former chancellor, Joe Gow, said Wednesday that interim Chancellor Betsy Morgan filed three charges against him March 29, accusing him of unethical conduct, failing to cooperate with an investigation, and using UW-La Crosse computers to produce pornographic materials.Gow declined to share a letter from Morgan detailing the charges, saying he didn’t want to look as though he is trying to play out his case in the media.But he said the ethics charge may be connected to his writings in two pornographic e-books. He declined to go into detail. The allegation of failure to cooperate stems from his refusal to speak to an outside law firm investigating the matter without an attorney, he said. He denied using any UW state-owned equipment or state dollars to produce porn.Spokespeople from UW-La Crosse didn’t respond to emails Wednesday seeking comment and details of the charges. Mark Pitsch, a spokesperson for the UW system, declined to comment.Gow said he has requested a hearing before a faculty committee, as is his right under state law. The committee would recommend to the Board of Regents, the UW system’s governing body, whether he can keep his backup job as a tenured communications professor. The board would make the final decision on whether he can stay on.The regents fired Gow from the chancellor post in December after learning he and his wife, former UW-La Crosse professor Carmen Wilson, were producing and starring in pornographic videos. They also wrote two e-books titled “Monogamy with Benefits: How Porn Enriches Our Relationship” and “Married with Benefits — Our Real-Life Adult Industry Adventures” under pseudonyms.Gow had planned to retire as chancellor at the conclusion of the spring 2024 semester and transition into a role teaching communication courses. But Jay Rothman, president of the UW system, put that on hold until his tenure could be reviewed.Gow has maintained he and his wife produced the pornographic materials on their own time. He insists that the videos and the books never mentioned UW-La Crosse or his role at the university and that the regents violated his free speech rights when they fired him.The faculty committee hearing has yet to be scheduled, Gow said, but he is anxious to clear his name. Students have told him that they think he’s a great person and that they’re eager to take his courses, he said.“It is really hard to be treated like a criminal when you haven’t done anything wrong,” Gow said. “I really am curious how the administration is going to prove I did anything wrong.”The regents hired James Beeby, provost at New Hampshire’s Keene State College, last month to succeed Gow as chancellor. Morgan was one of three finalists, along with Beeby and Indiana State University Provost Christopher Olsen.",2024-04-24 23:33:12 PM EEST,NPR,Former Wisconsin college chancellor fired over porn career is fighting to keep his faculty post,https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-uw-lacrosse-porn-chancellor-0fa71c528c498a25b95fdd30b5da900d
Kimberlee Kruesi,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee is poised to become the second state in the nation to make it illegal for adults to help minors get an abortion without parental consent, a proposal that is likely to face immediate legal challenges should Gov. Bill Lee sign it into law.Tennessee’s GOP-dominant Statehouse approved the bill Wednesday, clearing the way for the measure to head to the Republican governor’s desk. While Lee hasn’t public commented on the proposal, he has repeatedly defended enacting the state’s sweeping abortion ban and stressed his opposition to the procedure.Yet, even if Lee signs the measure into law, reproductive rights advocates are expected to move quickly to ask a court to block the statute from being enforced. Last year, Idaho became the first state to enact the so-called “ abortion trafficking ” law, but a federal judge has since temporarily blocked the law after reproductive rights groups sued to challenge it.“This bill is a direct attack on me, on my family, on my friends, on my network that support Tennesseans who are pregnant and vulnerable minors that need access to care to go across state lines and receive the necessary care,” said Democratic Rep. Aftyn Behn while debating the bill Tuesday evening.According to the legislation, Tennessee would make it illegal for an adult who “intentionally recruits, harbors, or transports” a pregnant minor within the state to get an abortion without consent from the minor’s parents or guardians. Yet supporters changed the proposal at the last-minute to exempt ambulance drivers, emergency medical services personnel and other common transportation services.Those convicted of breaking the law would be charged with a Class A misdemeanor, which requires a nearly one year imprisonment sentence.Republican Rep. Jason Zachary, the bill’s House sponsor, specifically referenced Behn’s previous public promise to help any young person travel out of state if they needed an abortion “even if it lands me in jail.”“That’s what recruitment looks like,” Zachary said as Behn pointed at herself while he read her statement.Meanwhile, Zachary also argued that the bill was necessary by pointing to a lawsuit filed earlier this year by Missouri’s attorney general.Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey has accused Planned Parenthood of illegally taking minors from Missouri into Kansas to obtain abortions without parental consent. The lawsuit, based on a video from a conservative group that has promoted false claims on other issues, is asking a state district court to stop Planned Parenthood from engaging in the conduct it alleges.“This piece of legislation protects parental rights,” Zachary said. “We are not relitigating abortion. That issue has already been settled in Tennessee fortunately.”However, critics have countered that the bill does not contain exemptions for minors who may have been raped by their parents or guardians. Instead, the legislation states that the biological father of the pregnant minor may not pursue a civil action if the pregnancy was caused by rape.Among the top critics of the measure is California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who launched an advertising campaign criticizing the Republican-backed bill by showing a young frightened woman handcuffed to a hospital bed and crying for help with a sexual assault evidence collection kit visible in the frame.Tennessee bans abortions at all stages of pregnancy but there are exemptions in cases of molar pregnancies, ectopic pregnancies, and to remove a miscarriage or to save the life of the mother. Notably, doctors must use their “reasonable medical” judgment — a term that some say is too vague and can be challenged by fellow medical officials — in deciding whether providing the procedure can save the life of the pregnant patient or prevent major injury.A group of women is currently suing to clarify the state’s abortion ban. A court decision is expected soon on whether the lawsuit can continue or if the law can be placed on hold as the legal battle continues.Ever since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion in 2022, anti-abortion advocates have been pushing states to find a way to block pregnant people from crossing state lines to obtain the procedure.",2024-04-24 22:55:35 PM EEST,NPR,Tennessee would criminalize helping minors get abortions under bill heading to governor,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-tennessee-ban-republican-dcb87d15d489d32868b5ba36d750d316
Tom Withers,"CLEVELAND (AP) — Connor Wong homered twice, Rafael Devers connected in his return to Boston’s lineup and the banged-up Red Sox got another solid pitching effort in an 8-0 win over the Cleveland Guardians on Wednesday night.Wong hit leadoff homers in the second and sixth innings off Carlos Carrasco (1-2). He added an RBI single in the ninth and had four hits.Devers missed the previous five games with a bone bruise in his knee. After testing his knee by scoring on a double in the first, he homered in the fifth and the Red Sox piled up a season-high 16 hits to cool off baseball’s hottest team with a four-hit shutout.“Any time that guy is in the lineup it completely changes it,” Wong said of Devers. “He can hit the ball really far at any point in the game so it’s great when he’s in there.”Rookie outfielder Wilyer Abreu also had four hits and drove in a run in Boston’s second shutout against Cleveland in a week.With three starters on the injured list, Red Sox manager Alex Cora was counting on his bullpen to get him through a game or two and rookie Cooper Criswell (1-1) gave him five scoreless innings in his fourth career start.Criswell allowed three singles before Cora used Joely Rodríguez and Zack Kelly for two innings apiece to finish off the Guardians.Despite numerous injuries, the Red Sox have gotten good pitching.They lowered their team ERA to 1.73, the lowest through 25 games since 1920.“We needed something like that,” Cora said. “Coop was amazing. Like I said before, we’re going to keep going, man. That’s who we are. We’re going to pitch. We will pitch. We’re playing better defense.”The Guardians had their winning streak stopped at five straight. They came in with MLB’s best record and came one win shy of matching the 1966 team (18-6) for the best start in franchise history through 24 games.It was Carrasco’s 200th career start for Cleveland and 100th at Progressive Field. The 37-year-old returned to the Guardians this season after being traded in 2020.“It means a lot because I did my first one in September 2009,” said Carrasco. “Just getting back here, I just want to do so well to win this game. But it’s part of the game, so tomorrow’s another day.”Before the game, the Red Sox placed starter Brayan Bello on the IL with lat tightness, the latest injury for a Boston team that has been dealing with more than its share of sprains and strains this spring.“It’s hard,” Cora said. “We’re going to continue. Nobody is going to feel sorry for the Red Sox.”Wong, who came in batting .393 with three homers against Cleveland, connected for his fourth homer in the second, driving a 1-1 pitch from Carrasco over the wall in straightaway center to make it 2-0.It was Boston’s MLB-leading 20th homer on the road.The Red Sox jumped on Carrasco for a run in the first as Devers singled and scored on Abreu’s two-out RBI double.As the All-Star broke for third, Cora could hardly watch.“I was praying, to be honest with you,” he said. “He didn’t look too good. He let it go at the end, but he wasn’t moving great.”Devers, who has also missed time with a shoulder injury, said his knee held up fine.“I wasn’t scared to go full speed there,” he said through a translator. “I haven’t run full speed since I got my injury, but I felt good.”Red Sox: Starting RHP Nick Pivetta (elbow) will throw a live batting practice Saturday before the team decides whether to send him out on a minor league rehab assignment. ... RHP Garrett Whitlock (oblique) is playing catch in Boston.Guardians: RHP Gavin Williams (elbow) received an anti-inflammatory injection after suffering a setback in his recovery.

He’ll won’t throw for at least one week before being re-evaluated.Guardians RHP Triston McKenzie (2-2, 5.00 ERA) will start the series finale against Red Sox RHP Chase Anderson (0-0 2.77).AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",2024-04-25 04:56:35 AM EEST,NPR,"Connor Wong homers twice, Rafael Devers connects for solo shot as Red Sox hammer Guardians 8-0",https://apnews.com/article/red-sox-guardians-score-5ec5004e2b33799bd70973c0f834f3b6
Tom Murphy,"Walgreens lost nearly $6 billion in its second quarter mainly due to a drop in value for the VillageMD clinic business it controls.Excluding that charge, the drugstore chain reported results Thursday that topped Wall Street expectations.Walgreens spent more than $5 billion a few years ago to acquire a majority stake in VillageMD and launch a plan to add hundreds of clinics to its stores and grow its ability to provide care.But the drugstore chain said Thursday that it recorded a $5.8 billion, after-tax impairment charge for VillageMD in its most recent quarter as it adjusted the asset’s value.VillageMD says on its website that it runs 680 locations. It specializes in clinics that deliver value-based care. That approach, which is growing popular with some insurers, essentially rewards doctors for keeping patients healthy instead of paying them for every service they perform.The company is dealing with slower-than-expected growth in patients and changes to reimbursement from the federal government’s Medicare program, among other challenges. Walgreens executives said Thursday that VillageMD is closing around 160 clinics, or 100 more than it previously announced.A Walgreens spokesman declined to say how many clinics were attached to the company’s drugstores.Walgreens announced its VillageMD partnership in 2020. Company leaders said then that they wanted to provide more comprehensive care to customers than what they offered in smaller clinics typically tucked in the back of its stores.The company also said it expected to open 500 to 700 primary care clinics in 30 markets over the next five years.But the drugstore chain has since changed CEOs. New leader Tim Wentworth has turned the company’s focus more to cutting costs and improving profitability.That has led Walgreens “to take a very big step back from operations that it used to see as central to its future,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData.“While Walgreens is not giving up on healthcare, the shutting of unprofitable primary care facilities cannot be seen as anything but a temporary retreat,” Saunders said in an email.Walgreens said on Thursday that it booked adjusted earnings of $1.20 per share in its fiscal second quarter as sales grew 6% to $37.1 billion.Analysts expected earnings of 82 cents per share on $35.86 billion in revenue, according to FactSet.Walgreens also said it was narrowing its forecast for fiscal 2024 to adjusted earnings of $3.20 to $3.35 per share.Analysts predict $3.24 per share.Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., based outside of Chicago in Deerfield, Illinois, runs around 13,000 drugstores globally. Most of its locations are in the United States.Company shares rose 8 cents to $21.10 Thursday.",2024-03-28 18:18:21 PM EEST,NPR,Walgreens books hefty charge as the drugstore chain adjusts the value of struggling clinics,https://apnews.com/article/walgreens-villagemd-clinics-0d03184cfa3934705d615e8bd1e8bb51
Darlene Superville,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Jill Biden on Wednesday sounded a red horn to start the Wounded Warrior Project’s annual Soldier Ride from the White House lawn, using the launch of the multiday bike ride to stress the importance of supporting service members.“My husband often says that we have many obligations as a nation but only one sacred obligation: to support you and your families when we send you into harm’s way and when you return,” she said of President Joe Biden, who is up for reelection.Jill Biden spoke about steps the administration has taken to expand veteran access to quality home health care, provide benefits and care for veterans harmed by toxins and prevent homelessness and suicide among veterans. She also talked about help for spouses of active-duty and retired servicemembers.President Biden unexpectedly joined the first lady after signing a $95 billion war aid bill and referred to the group of riders as the “spine of America.”The Wounded Warrior Project was founded in 2003 to help veterans and the families and caregivers of service members who suffered a physical or mental injury or illness while serving in the military on or after Sept. 11, 2001.

Joe Reedy,"ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Baltimore’s Gunnar Henderson continued his hot streak at the plate Wednesday against the Los Angeles Angels.The shortstop’s biggest play, though, was defensively when he tagged out Jo Adell at second base after a great throw by catcher James McCann for the final out as the Orioles held on for a 6-5 victory.Adell drew a walk with two outs, but was caught stealing as he tried to get into scoring position as the potential tying run after the Angels trailed 6-0 going into the bottom of the sixth. Mike Trout started Los Angeles’ rally by becoming the first player in the majors to reach 10 home runs this season.“I felt like I got a good tag on him. It was really close,” said Henderson, who had three hits and drove in three runs. “We’re very fortunate that they called it out on the field.”The call stood after a lengthy replay review. Major League Baseball said in a statement the replay official could not definitively determine that Adell touched second base before Henderson applying the tagAngels manager Ron Washington and Adell both thought it should have been overturned.“The guy on the mound (Craig Kimbrell) was slow. The opportunity was there and we took it,” Washington said. “From all replays we saw, it looked like he was safe but we don’t make the call.”Adell said he felt like his foot reached the bag before the tag.“A little disappointing to end the game that way. But hopefully we can get those right moving forward,” he said.Kimbrell gave up a run in the ninth, but held on to pick up his seventh save of the season. It was also the 424th of his career, tied with John Franco for sixth on the all-time list.Henderson is 9 of 20 in the last five games. The shortstop, last year’s unanimous choice for AL Rookie of the Year, homered for the second straight game when he led off the third with a drive off Tyler Anderson (2-3). It was Henderson’s eighth of the season, which is second in the American League.Adley Rutschman had his 12th multihit game of the year with two hits and an RBI.“He’s done everything. He’s playing great defense, homers, steals, running the bases, hits. It’s been awesome,” manager Brandon Hyde said of Henderson.Batting leadoff for the second straight day, Trout got the Angels on the board with a solo shot down the left-field line off Dean Kremer (1-2) in the sixth. It’s the third time in the past seven seasons Trout has been the first in the majors to reach double digits in homers.Taylor Ward and Zach Neto also homered for the Angels, who have dropped five of six.“We were gong to keep fighting until the final out. We had a chance at the end and didn’t come through,” Trout said.Kremer didn’t allow a hit until Adell’s single with two outs in the fifth. The right-hander struck out 10 in 5 2/3 innings with two runs allowed on three hits.After Henderson connected on Anderson’s cutter for his third homer this season against the Angels, he led off the fifth with a double and scored on Rutschman’s base hit.Baltimore broke it open with four in the sixth as the first five hitters got aboard against José Suarez. After Jorge Mateo’s run-scoring, ground-rule double, Henderson had the key hit with a liner up the middle to plate two more.Anderson allowed two runs and four hits with four walks and seven strikeouts. The left-hander threw 105 pitches, the second-most he has tossed in the first five innings in his nine-year career.After Nolan Schanuel’s base hit chased Kremer in the sixth, Ward hit Jacob Webb’s first pitch just over the outstretched glove at the wall in right-center to get the Angels within 6-3.Neto led off the eighth with a first-pitch solo shot to left for his first this season.Orioles: Hyde said LHP John Means (left forearm strain) will start Sunday’s game against Oakland or get another rehab start for Triple-A Norfolk.Angels: 3B Miguel Sanó left in the sixth due to left knee soreness.Orioles: Return home for three games against Oakland.

Mike Stobbe,"NEW YORK (AP) — The number of U.S. tuberculosis cases in 2023 were the highest in a decade, according to a new government report.Forty states reported an increase in TB, and rates were up among all age groups, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday. More than 9,600 cases were reported, a 16% increase from 2022 and the highest since 2013.Cases declined sharply at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, but have been rising since.Most U.S. TB cases are diagnosed in people born in other countries. Experts say the 2023 number is in part a combination of a surge in TB cases internationally — the World Health Organization said TB was behind only COVID-19 in infectious fatal diseases worldwide in 2022. And there are also increases in migration and post-pandemic international travel.But other factors are also at play, including other illnesses that weaken the immune system and allow latent TB infections to emerge.CDC officials expected TB numbers would rise, but the 2023 count “was a little more than was expected,” said Dr. Philip LoBue, director of the agency’s Division of Tuberculosis Elimination.Despite the jump, the number and rate of new TB cases each year remains smaller than it was in the past, and the U.S. has a lower rate of new TB cases than most countries.Tuberculosis is caused by bacteria that usually attack the lungs, and is spread through the air when an infectious person coughs or sneezes. If not treated properly, it can be fatal. In the late 1800s, TB killed one out of every seven people living in the United States and Europe. But the development of antibiotics and public health efforts succeeded in treating infections and tracking down those they infected, leading to cases falling for decades.The new CDC statistics are not a count of how many people were newly infected in 2023, but rather of how many people developed a cough or other symptoms and were diagnosed.An estimated 85% of the people counted in 2023 were infected at least a year or two earlier and had what’s called latent TB, when the bacteria enters the body and hibernates in the lungs or other parts of the body. Experts estimate as many as 13 million Americans have latent TB and are not contagious.When the immune system is weakened — by certain medications or other illnesses like diabetes and HIV — the TB wakes up, so to speak. Nicole Skaggs said she was infected in 2020, but didn’t develop symptoms until 2022 — after she got sick from COVID-19.“Anything that can take out or lower your immune system can put you at risk,” said Skaggs, 41, a property manager in Bothell, Washington.CDC officials called the idea that COVID-19 has played a role in increased reactivation of TB “an important question.” Scientists are still learning what causes latent TB to reactivate and “I would consider it an unknown at this point,” LoBue said.“It’s too early to tell” what will happen to TB trends in the next few years, he also said.There are TB vaccines being developed, and public health workers that were focused on COVID are now back to trying new approaches to preventing TB. New York City, which saw cases jump 28% last year, is hiring TB case managers and community health workers and increasingly using video monitoring of patients taking medications to keep treatment rates high, said Dr. Ashwin Vasan, the city’s health commissioner.On the other hand, federal TB funding for state and local health department efforts has been flat, and one of the key antibiotics used against TB has been in short supply in recent years. Plus, drug-resistant TB infections have popped up in a fraction of cases.The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Julie Carr Smyth,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Republican legislative leaders in Ohio say they are negotiating with Democrats to assure President Joe Biden appears on the state’s November ballot, but the exact shape of the solution remains murky.GOP Ohio Senate President Matt Huffman told reporters Wednesday that productive discussions are under way between both legislative chambers and both political parties about how to fix the fact that the Democratic National Convention, where Biden is to be formally nominated, falls after Ohio’s ballot deadline of Aug. 7. The convention will be held Aug. 19-22 in Chicago.“Certainly, it’s something that’s going to happen. We need to take care of it,” Huffman said, seeming to adjust his earlier stance that it was “a Democratic problem” that was up to the General Assembly’s minority party to work out. He said the answer may be added to an existing bill or it could be contained in a stand-alone measure.On Tuesday, Republican House Speaker Jason Stephens expressed support for doing something to fix the problem with Ohio’s deadline not just for this election cycle, but on a longer term basis.Since Ohio changed its certification deadline from 60 to 90 days ahead of its general election, state lawmakers have had to adjust the requirement twice, in 2012 and 2020, to accommodate candidates of both parties. Each change was only temporary.Huffman said he also favors a more permanent solution.Senate Democratic Leader Nickie Antonio continued to express confidence Wednesday that Biden will make Ohio’s ballot, saying that “all options are being explored.”“The discussion is there, and it will become reality when we see it,” she said. Antonio said a proxy war between Huffman and Stephens for next session’s speakership is “the elephant in the room” that may be causing delays.As Ohio nears the May 9 cutoff set by Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, legislation meant to ensure Biden will appear on fall ballots in Alabama cleared the state’s Senate Tuesday.

Mike Stobbe,"ATLANTA (AP) — A person in Texas has been diagnosed with bird flu, an infection tied to the recent discovery of the virus in dairy cows, health officials said Monday.The patient was being treated with an antiviral drug and their only reported symptom was eye redness, Texas health officials said. Health officials say the person had been in contact with cows presumed to be infected, and the risk to the public remains low.It marks the first known instance globally of a person catching this version of bird flu from a mammal, federal health officials said.However, there’s no evidence of person-to-person spread or that anyone has become infected from milk or meat from livestock, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Genetic tests don’t suggest that the virus suddenly is spreading more easily or that it is causing more severe illness, Shah said. And current antiviral medications still seem to work, he added.Last week, dairy cows in Texas and Kansas were reported to be infected with bird flu — and federal agriculture officials later confirmed infections in a Michigan dairy herd that had recently received cows from Texas. None of the hundreds of affected cows have died, Shah said.Since 2020, a bird flu virus has been spreading among more animal species – including dogs, cats, skunks, bears and even seals and porpoises – in scores of countries. However, the detection in U.S. livestock is an “unexpected and problematic twist,” said Dr. Ali Khan, a former CDC outbreak investigator who is now dean of the University of Nebraska’s public health college.This bird flu was first identified as a threat to people during a 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong. More than 460 people have died in the past two decades from bird flu infections, according to the World Health Organization.The vast majority of infected people got it directly from birds, but scientists have been on guard for any sign of spread among people.Texas officials didn’t identify the newly infected person, nor release any details about what brought them in contact with the cows.The CDC does not recommend testing for people who have no symptoms.

"Maria Cheng,Misper Apawu","ACCRA, Ghana (AP) — When Efua, a 25-year-old fashion designer and single mother in Ghana, became pregnant last year, she sought an abortion at a health clinic but worried the procedure might be illegal. Health workers assured her abortions were lawful under certain conditions in the West African country, but Efua said she was still nervous.“I had lots of questions, just to be sure I would be safe,” Efua told the Associated Press, on condition that only her middle name be used, for fear of reprisals from the growing anti-abortion movement in her country.Finding reliable information was difficult, she said, and she didn’t tell her family about her procedure. “It comes with too many judgments,” she decided.More than 20 countries across Africa have loosened restrictions on abortion in recent years, but experts say that like Efua, many women probably don’t realize they are entitled to a legal abortion. And despite the expanded legality of the procedure in places like Ghana, Congo, Ethiopia and Mozambique, some doctors and nurses say they’ve become increasingly wary of openly providing abortions. They’re fearful of triggering the ire of opposition groups that have become emboldened since the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 decision overturning the nationwide right to abortion.“We are providing a legal service for women who want an abortion, but we do not advertise it openly,” said Esi Asare Prah, who works at the clinic where Efua had the procedure — legal under Ghana’s law, passed in 1985. “We’ve found that people are OK with our clinic providing abortions, as long as we don’t make it too obvious what we are doing.”The Maputo Protocol, a human rights treaty in effect since 2005 for all 55 countries of the African Union, says every nation on the continent should grant women the right to a medical abortion in cases of rape, sexual assault, incest, and endangerment for the mental or physical health of the mother or fetus.Africa is alone globally in having such a treaty, but more than a dozen of its countries have yet to pass laws granting women access to abortions. Even in those that have legalized the procedure, obstacles to access remain. And misinformation is rampant in many countries, with a recent study faulting practices by Google and Meta.“The right to abortion exists in law, but in practice, the reality may be a little different,” said Evelyne Opondo, of the International Center for Research on Women. She noted that poorer countries in particular, such as Benin and Ethiopia, may permit abortions in some instances but struggle with a lack of resources to make them available to all women. Many women learn of their options only through word of mouth.Across Africa, MSI Reproductive Choices — which provides contraception and abortion in 37 countries worldwide — reports that staff have been repeatedly targeted by anti-abortion groups. The group cites harassment and intimidation of staff in Ethiopia. And in Nigeria, MSI’s clinic was raided and temporarily closed after false allegations that staffers had illegally accessed confidential documents.“The opposition to abortion in Africa has always existed, but now they are better organized,” said Mallah Tabot, of the International Planned Parenthood Federation in Kenya. She noted that a significant amount of money backing anti-abortion efforts appears to have come from conservative American groups — and severalreports have found millions in such funding from conservative Christian organizations.The spike from opposition groups is alarming, said Angela Akol, of the reproductive rights advocacy group Ipas.“We’ve seen them in Kenya and Uganda advocating at the highest levels of government for reductions to abortion access,” she said. “There are patriarchal and almost misogynistic norms across much of Africa. ... The West is tapping into that momentum after the Roe v. Wade reversal to challenge abortion rights here.”Congo, one of the world’s poorest countries, introduced a law in 2018 permitting abortions in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy in cases of rape, incest, and physical or mental health risks to the woman.Even so, pamphlets aimed at women who might want an abortion use coded language, said Patrick Djemo, of MSI in Congo.“We talk about the management of unwanted pregnancies,” he said, noting that they don’t use the word abortion. “It could cause a backlash.”Accurate language and information can be hard to find online, too. Last week, a study from MSI and the Center for Countering Digital Hate found that Google and Meta — which operates Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp — restricted access to accurate information about abortion in countries including Ghana, Nigeria and Kenya.The study said the tech giants banned local abortion providers from advertising services while approving paid ads from anti-abortion groups pushing false claims about decriminalization efforts as part of a global conspiracy to “eliminate” local populations.Google didn’t respond to a request for comment on the study. Meta said via email that its platforms “prohibit ads that mislead people about services a business provides” and that it would review the report.Opondo, of the international women’s center, said she’s deeply concerned about the future of abortion-rights movements in Africa, with opponents using the same tactics that helped overturn Roe vs. Wade in the U.S.Yet, she said, for now it’s “still probably easier for a woman in Benin to get an abortion than in Texas.”For Efua, information and cost were obstacles. She cobbled together the necessary 1,000 Ghana cedis ($77) for her abortion after asking a friend to help.She said she wishes women could easily get reliable information, especially given the physical and mental stress she experienced. She said she wouldn’t have been able to handle another baby on her own and believes many other women face similar dilemmas.“If you’re pregnant and not ready,” she said, “it could really affect you mentally and for the rest of your life.”Cheng reported from London.The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Lauran Neergaard,"PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Jazmin Evans had been waiting for a new kidney for four years when her hospital revealed shocking news: She should have been put on the transplant list in 2015 instead of 2019 — and a racially biased organ test was to blame.As upsetting as that notification was, it also was part of an unprecedented move to mitigate the racial inequity. Evans is among more than 14,000 Black kidney transplant candidates so far given credit for lost waiting time, moving them up the priority list for their transplant.“I remember just reading that letter over and over again,” said Evans, 29, of Philadelphia, who shared the notice in a TikTok video to educate other patients. “How could this happen?”At issue is a once widely used test that overestimated how well Black people’s kidneys were functioning, making them look healthier than they really were — all because of an automated formula that calculated results for Black and non-Black patients differently. That race-based equation could delay diagnosis of organ failure and evaluation for a transplant, exacerbating other disparities that already make Black patients more at risk of needing a new kidney but less likely to get one.A few years ago, the National Kidney Foundation and American Society of Nephrology prodded laboratories to switch to race-free equations in calculating kidney function. Then the U.S. organ transplant network ordered hospitals to use only race-neutral test results in adding new patients to the kidney waiting list.“The immediate question came up: What about the people on the list right now? You can’t just leave them behind,” said Dr. Martha Pavlakis of Boston’s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and former chair of the network’s kidney committee.Pavlakis calls what happened next an attempt at restorative justice: The transplant network gave hospitals a year to uncover which Black kidney candidates could have qualified for a new kidney sooner if not for the race-based test — and adjust their waiting time to make up for it. That lookback continues for each newly listed Black patient to see if they, too, should have been referred sooner.Between January 2023 and mid-March, more than 14,300 Black kidney transplant candidates have had their wait times modified, by an average of two years, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, which runs the transplant system. So far more than 2,800 of them, including Evans, have received a transplant.But it’s just one example of a larger problem permeating health care. Numerous formulas or “algorithms” used in medical decisions — treatment guidelines, diagnostic tests, risk calculators — adjust the answers according to race or ethnicity in a way that puts people of color at disadvantage.Given how embedded these equations are in medical software and electronic records, even doctors may not realize how widely they impact care decisions.“Health equity scholars have been raising alarm bells about the way race has been misused in clinical algorithms for decades,” said Dr. Michelle Morse, New York City’s chief medical officer.Change is beginning, slowly. No longer are obstetricians supposed to include race in determining the risk of a pregnant woman attempting vaginal birth after a prior C-section. The American Heart Association just removed race from a commonly used calculator of people’s heart disease risk. The American Thoracic Society has urged replacing race-based lung function evaluation.The kidney saga is unique because of the effort to remedy a past wrong.“Lots of time when we see health inequities, we just assume there’s nothing we can do about it,” Morse said. “We can make changes to restore faith in the health system and to actually address the unfair and avoidable outcomes that Black people and other people of color face.”Black Americans are over three times more likely than white people to experience kidney failure. Of the roughly 89,000 people currently on the waiting list for a new kidney, about 30% are Black.Race isn’t a biological factor like age, sex or weight — it’s a social construct. So how did it make its way into calculations of kidney function?The eGFR, or estimated glomerular filtration rate, evaluates kidney health based on how quickly a waste compound called creatinine gets filtered from blood. In 1999, an equation used to calculate eGFR was modified to adjust Black people’s results compared to everyone else’s, based on some studies with small numbers of Black patients and a long-ago false theory about differences in creatinine levels. Until recently that meant many lab reports would list two results — one calculated for non-Black patients and another for Black patients that could overestimate kidney function by as much as 16%.Not every Black kidney candidate was affected. Some may have had kidney failure diagnosed without that test. For others to have a chance at benefitting from UNOS’ mandated lookback, transplant center staff-turned-detectives often worked after hours and weekends, hunting years-old records for a test that, recalculated without the race adjustment, might make the difference.“You’re reaching out to the nephrologist, their primary care doctors, the dialysis units to get those records,” said Dr. Pooja Singh of Jefferson Health’s transplant institute in Philadelphia, where Evans received her new kidney. “That first patient getting transplanted for us was such a great moment for our program that the work didn’t feel like work after that.”A high school sports physical first spotted Evans’ kidney disease at age 17. While finishing her master’s degree and beginning to earn her Ph.D. at Temple University, she started dialysis — for nine hours a night while she slept — and was placed on the transplant list.How long it takes to get a kidney transplant depends on patients’ blood type, medical urgency and a mix of other factors — including how long they’ve spent on the waiting list. Evans was first listed in April 2019. When the Jefferson transplant center unearthed her old lab tests, they found she should have qualified in September 2015.“Just for context, when I was still an undergrad I should have been on the list,” she said, recalling the anger she felt as she read the letter. What she called “a mind-blowing” credit of 3½ more years waiting also provided “a glimmer of hope” that she’d be offered a matching kidney soon.Evans got a new kidney on July 4 and is healthy again, and grateful the policy change came in time for her.“You don’t know if people would be alive today” if it had been enacted earlier, she said. Still, that extra step of “making amends to fix the situation for those that we can — I feel like it’s very important and it’s very necessary if you’re truly wanting to bring more equity and equality into the medical field.”AP Videojournalists Tassanee Vejpongsa and Shelby Lum contributed to this report.The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Mike Stobbe,"NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. health officials are warning of an increase in rare bacterial illnesses than can lead to meningitis and possible death.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an alert to U.S. doctors on Thursday about an increase in cases of one type of invasive meningococcal disease, most of it due to a specific strain of bacteria.Last year, 422 cases of it were reported in the U.S. — the most in a year since 2014. Already, 143 cases have been reported this year, meaning infections appear to be on track to surpass 2023, the CDC said. Most of the cases last year did not involve meningitis, though at least 17 died. The cases were disproportionately more common in adults ages 30 to 60, in Black people and in people who have HIV, the CDC said.The bacteria can cause a dangerous brain and spinal cord inflammation called meningitis, with symptoms that may include fever, headache, stiff neck, nausea and vomiting. The bacteria also can cause a bloodstream infection with symptoms like chills, fatigue, cold hands and feet, rapid breathing, diarrhea, or, in later stages, a dark purple rash.The infection can be treated with antibiotics, but quick treatment is essential. An estimated 10% to 15% of infected people die, and survivors sometimes suffer deafness or amputations.There also are vaccines against meningococcal disease.Officials recommend that all children should get a meningococcal conjugate vaccine, which protects against the rising strain, at around the time they enter a middle school. Since vaccine protection fades, the CDC also recommends a booster dose at age 16. Shots also are recommended for people at higher risk, like those in a place where an outbreak is occurring or those with HIV infection or certain other health conditions.The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Matthew Perrone,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Anti-smoking groups sued the U.S. government Tuesday over a long-awaited ban on menthol cigarettes, which has been idling at the White House for months.The lawsuit is the latest effort to force the government to ban menthols, which are disproportionately used by Black smokers and young people. It comes amid growing concerns from advocates that the federal plan could be derailed by election-year politics.Health officials under President Joe Biden initially targeted last August to publish the rule eliminating the minty flavor. Late last year, White House officials said they would take until March to review the rule. Three nonprofit groups, including Action on Smoking and Health, filed their lawsuit in a federal court in California after the March deadline passed.“Because of defendants’ inaction, tobacco companies have continued to use menthol cigarettes to target youth, women, and the Black community — all to the detriment of public health,” the groups state in their complaint.A spokesperson for the White House declined to comment on the lawsuit Tuesday.The Food and Drug Administration has spent years developing the plan to eliminate menthol, estimating it could prevent 300,000 to 650,000 smoking deaths over several decades. Most of those preventable deaths would be among Black Americans.Like all major federal regulations, the plan must get final approval from the White House.Previous FDA efforts on menthol have been scuttled by tobacco industry pushback or competing political priorities across several administrations. The latest delay comes as Democrats voice worries about Biden’s prospects in a rematch against former President Donald Trump.White House officials have held dozens of meetings with groups opposing the menthol ban, including civil rights advocates, business owners and law enforcement officials. Some suggested a rule targeting menthols could suppress Biden’s turnout among Black voters. In almost all cases, groups opposing the ban receive financial support from tobacco companies.In recent months, supporters of the plan have tried to assure the White House that banning menthol will not hurt Biden’s re-election chances.“If Black lives truly matter, then we must end the sale of menthol cigarettes and do it now,” said Dr. Carol McGruder, of the African American Tobacco Control Leadership, in a statement. McGruder’s group is among those suing the FDA and its parent agency, the Department of Health and Human Services.A lawyer who helped file the lawsuit said the government will have about two months to respond.A 2020 lawsuit by the same groups jump-started FDA’s work on menthol, alleging that the agency had “unreasonably delayed” action against the flavor.Menthol is the only cigarette flavor that was not banned under the 2009 law that gave the FDA authority over tobacco products, an exemption negotiated by industry lobbyists. The act did, though, instruct the agency to continue to weigh whether to ban menthol.The flavor’s persistence has infuriated anti-smoking advocates, who point to research that menthol’s numbing effect masks the harshness of smoking, making it easier to start and harder to quit.More than 11% of U.S. adults smoke, with rates roughly even between white and Black populations. About 80% of Black smokers — and most teenagers who smoke — use menthol.Associated Press writer Zeke Miller contributed to this storyThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Mike Stobbe,"NEW YORK (AP) — New U.S. hepatitis C infections dropped slightly in 2022, a surprising improvement after more than a decade of steady increases, federal health officials said Wednesday.Experts are not sure whether the 6% decline is a statistical blip or the start of a downward trend. Seeing 2023 and 2024 data, when it’s available, will help public health officials understand what’s going on, said Daniel Raymond, director of policy at the National Viral Hepatitis Roundtable, an advocacy organization.“We’ve had a decade of bad news ... I am cautiously encouraged,” he said. “You always want to hope like something like this is real, and a potential sign that the tide has turned.”Infection rates did not occur across the board. They declined for white Americans, but continued to rise in Black, Latino and Native American communities, according to Dr. Neil Gupta, who oversees the branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that tracks viral hepatitis.The hepatitis C virus is spread through contact with blood from an infected person. The virus does most of its damage by infecting the liver, and, if left untreated, can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer. Infections are driven mainly by people injecting illicit drugs.Data released by the CDC for 2022 shows 4,848 new infections, down from 5,023 reported the year before. The CDC estimates about 67,000 new hepatitis C infections actually occurred in 2022, because many people who become infected don’t realize it, meaning most new infections are not diagnosed and reported. But that too is down, from 70,000 estimated for 2021.The new infection rate — used to better compare data from one year to another — dropped 6%. Though the decline is encouraging, Gupta said, the 2022 statistics are still twice as high was what the nation saw in 2015.Cases had consistently gone up since 2013 during the longstanding opioid epidemic due to drug users shooting heroin and fentanyl. Experts say a couple of factors could have contributed to a decline in 2022, including successful prevention efforts and needle exchanges.The North America Syringe Exchange Network keeps a directory of U.S. programs, and listings have grown from about 300 to nearly 500 in the last several years, said Paul LaKosky, NASEN’s executive director. Many programs also have boosted hepatitis C testing and found ways to get infected people to treatment, he noted.But LaKosky and others think something else may be at play, too: Drug users are shifting from injecting to smoking. A recent CDC report found that between early 2020 and late 2022, the percentage of overdose deaths with evidence of smoking rose 74% while the percentage of deaths with evidence of injection fell 29%.Fewer people injecting drugs like fentanyl means fewer opportunities for the spread of hepatitis C, experts noted.“There has been a tremendous shift in the way people are consuming their drugs. There’s been a decrease in demand for syringes. We’ve seen this nationwide,” said LaKosky, who added there is more demand for supplies to snort or smoke drugs.More than 2 million Americans are infected with hepatitis C, some of them having lived with infections for many years, the CDC estimates. About 12,700 Americans died in 2022 of hepatitis C-related causes, the CDC said.The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Laura Ungar,"Brown rats are the undisputed winners of the real rat race.New research suggests that they crawled off ships arriving in North America earlier than previously thought and out-competed rodent rivals – going on to infuriate and disgust generations of city-dwellers and becoming so ubiquitous that they’re known as common rats, street rats or sewer rats.It didn’t take long for them to push aside the black rats that had likely arrived with Columbus and thrived in colonial cities.After first appearing on the continent before 1740, brown rats took over the East Coast from black rats “in only a matter of decades,” said Michael Buckley, one of the authors of a study published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.Brown rats are larger and more aggressive than black rats — and they want to be close to human populations, said Matthew Frye, a researcher and community educator with the New York State Integrated Pest Management Program at Cornell University.From this research, “we know a more exact time of when they arrived and then what they were doing once they got here,” said Frye, who was not involved with the study. “Having that picture of the rat population helps us better understand what they’re doing and maybe how we can manage them.”Neither rat species is native to North America, said Buckley, of the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom. Scientists used to think that brown rats arrived around 1776. The new study pushes that date back by more than 35 years.Buckley and his colleagues analyzed rodent bones that had already been excavated by archeologists. The remains came from 32 settlements in eastern North America and the Gulf of Mexico dated from the founding of Jamestown in 1607 through the early 1900s. Other samples were from seven shipwrecks dating from about 1550 to 1770.The data suggests that shipping networks across the Atlantic Ocean “essentially functioned as rat superhighways,” with brown rats gaining their earliest footholds in coastal shipping centers, said Ryan Kennedy, a study author at Indiana University who researches animal remains at archaeological sites.One probable reason they dominated, researchers suggest, is that they ate food black rats would otherwise have consumed – which may have reduced reproduction among black rats. Historical anecdotes back up this finding, describing the near disappearance of black rats from cities in the 1830s.Today, both types of rats exist in North American cities, though brown rats are more prevalent. Some urban centers are especially overrun. New York City, for example, last year hired a “rat czar ” to tackle a growing problem there.The biggest issue? Rats can carry diseases. Brown rats are known to spread a bacterial disease called leptospirosis, which is caused by bacteria in the urine of infected animals. They can also help spread murine typhus and food-borne germs like salmonella.Experts said knowing which type of rat leads the pack helps cities control the pests — even if it may not seem like it sometimes.For instance, brown rats like to hang out on or near the ground rather than in the trees or other high spots, where black rats often prefer to stay.Both black and brown rats are omnivores, but brown rats are especially fond of animal products — meaning reducing those in food wastes “should have the greatest chance of reducing the value of urban habitats for rat populations,” Buckley said.Frye said all efforts to cut down on available food waste help.“Food availability is the No. 1 reason that brown rats are there,” he said. “Any efforts to sort of prevent rats from getting at food sources is an effective measure.”The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Arnie Melendrez Stapleton,"ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) — Colorado became the 11th state in the U.S. to sanction girls flag football as a high school sport this week, thanks to an assist from the Denver Broncos.The Colorado High School Activities Association’s legislative council approved the fall sport following a three-year pilot program supported by the team and its foundation.Team owner Carrie Walton Penner said Wednesday that with the sport’s approval, “more young women will be able to participate in a game they love. More young women will join teams and create relationships that last a lifetime.”“To all you trailblazing athletes who helped launch this sport: You have not only found your community — you have built one.”Walton Penner said a majority of the 1,500 girls who took part in the pilot program wouldn’t have participated in a fall sport were it not for flag football.“That’s why this moment matters,” Walton Penner said. “It matters for every girl who loves football but has never seen a place for herself.”Walton Penner called the sport’s arrival on the Colorado high school football scene “part of a larger movement in which women’s sports are drawing attention like never before.”The Denver Broncos Foundation launched the state’s girls flag football pilot program in the fall of 2021 with support from the Broncos and CHSAA, funding and operating both seasons in which about 1,500 athletes from 50 schools across 10 districts participated.The Broncos hosted the program’s championship tournaments both years at its fieldhouse in suburban Englewood as well as a round-robin exhibition tournament last fall.Flag football is one of the fastest-growing sports globally and will debut as an Olympic sport during the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",2024-04-25 02:09:23 AM EEST,NPR,"With an assist from the Denver Broncos, Colorado becomes 11th state to sanction girls flag football",https://apnews.com/article/denver-broncos-flag-football-high-school-21f714fc098be6d76b05aca1dd0cc5d3
Matthew Perrone,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The company responsible for a global recall of sleep apnea machines will be barred from resuming production at U.S. facilities until it meets a number of safety requirements, under a long-awaited settlement announced Tuesday by federal officials.Philips will be required to overhaul its manufacturing and quality control systems and hire independent experts to vet the changes, according to a court order announced by the U.S. Department of Justice. The company must also continue to replace, repair or provide refunds to all U.S. customers who got the defective devices, the department said.The action is a major step toward resolving one of the biggest medical device recalls in history, which has dragged on for nearly three years.Most of the devices recalled are continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, machines. They force air through a mask to keep mouth and nasal passageways open during sleep. Left untreated, sleep apnea can lead to dangerous drowsiness and increased risk of heart attack.Philips has recalled more than 5 million of the machines since 2021 because their internal foam can break down over time, leading users to inhale tiny particles and fumes while they sleep. Efforts to repair or replace the machines have been plagued by delays that have frustrated regulators and patients in the U.S. and other countries.Lawyers for the federal government alleged that the company failed to comply with good manufacturing practices needed to ensure device safety. The company did not admit to the allegations, according to the court filing.“This office, the FDA and our partner agencies are committed to holding manufacturers accountable when they violate the law and put the public at risk,” U.S. Attorney Eric Olshan said in a statement.Under the legal agreement, Philips must hire independent auditors to create a plan for fixing its manufacturing problems and for monitoring problems with the sleep devices. The plan must then be approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The experts must also certify that new foam selected by the company meets FDA safety standards.Jeffrey Reed, of Marysville, Ohio, experienced persistent sinus infections and two bouts of pneumonia during the seven years he used a Philips machine.“I worry about my long-term health,” Reed said. “I used this machine for years and no matter what money I might get out of this, what’s going to happen?”Reed received a newer Philips device after returning his old machine, but he doesn’t like to use it, preferring a competitor’s device.“I don’t trust the company,” Reed said. “I don’t want to use it.”Reed is one of more than 750 people who have filed personal injury lawsuits against the company over the devices. Those cases have been consolidated in a federal court in Pennsylvania.Similar lawsuits are pending in Canada, Australia, Israel and Chile, according to the company.The Dutch manufacturer announced in January it had reached a tentative agreement with the FDA and the Department of Justice. But U.S. regulators wouldn’t confirm the deal at the time because it had not yet been reviewed by a federal judge.A company spokesman said Tuesday the agreement provides “a roadmap of defined actions, milestones, and deliverables to meet relevant regulatory requirements,” in an emailed statement. He noted that Philips will still be able to export some machines for sale outside the U.S.The FDA’s website warns patients that the risks of ingesting the sound-dampening foam could include headache, asthma, allergic reactions and more serious problems.An FDA inspection of Philips’ Pennsylvania offices in the fall of 2021 uncovered a spate of red flags, including emails suggesting the company was warned of the problem with its foam six years before the recall.Between 2016 and early 2021, FDA found 14 instances where Philips was made aware of the issue or was analyzing the problem. “No further design change, corrective action or field correction was conducted,” the FDA inspectors repeatedly noted.In 2022, the FDA took the rare step of ordering Philips to step up its outreach to customers about the recall including “clearer information about the health risks of its products.” At the time, the agency estimated only about half the people in the U.S. with affected machines knew they had been recalled.Customers trying to obtain refunds or new or refurbished devices from the company have reported long delays.The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Carla K. Johnson,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s accelerated approval program is meant to give patients early access to promising drugs. But how often do these drugs actually improve or extend patients’ lives?In a new study, researchers found that most cancer drugs granted accelerated approval do not demonstrate such benefits within five years.“Five years after the initial accelerated approval, you should have a definitive answer,” said Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a cancer specialist and bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved in the research. “Thousands of people are getting those drugs. That seems a mistake if we don’t know whether they work or not.”The program was created in 1992 to speed access to HIV drugs. Today, 85% of accelerated approvals go to cancer drugs.It allows the FDA to grant early approval to drugs that show promising initial results for treating debilitating or fatal diseases. In exchange, drug companies are expected to do rigorous testing and produce better evidence before gaining full approval.Patients get access to drugs earlier, but the tradeoff means some of the medications don’t pan out. It’s up to the FDA or the drugmaker to withdraw disappointing drugs, and sometimes the FDA has decided that less definitive evidence is good enough for a full approval.The new study found that between 2013 and 2017, there were 46 cancer drugs granted accelerated approval. Of those, 63% were converted to regular approval even though only 43% demonstrated a clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.The research was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association and discussed at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting in San Diego on Sunday.It’s unclear how much cancer patients understand about drugs with accelerated approval, said study co-author Dr. Edward Cliff of Harvard Medical School.“We raise the question: Is that uncertainty being conveyed to patients?” Cliff said.Drugs that got accelerated approval may be the only option for patients with rare or advanced cancers, said Dr. Jennifer Litton of MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who was not involved in the study.It’s important for doctors to carefully explain the evidence, Litton said.“It might be shrinking of tumor. It might be how long the tumor stays stable,” Litton said. “You can provide the data you have, but you shouldn’t overpromise.”Congress recently updated the program, giving the FDA more authority and streamlining the process for withdrawing drugs when companies don’t meet their commitments.The changes allow the agency “to withdraw approval for a drug approved under accelerated approval, when appropriate, more quickly,” FDA spokesperson Cherie Duvall-Jones wrote in an email. The FDA can now require that a confirmatory trial be underway when it grants preliminary approval, which speeds up the process of verifying whether a drug works, she said.The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

"Laura Ungar,Devi Shastri","Adrienne Mansanares expects a flurry of calls from patients in Arizona starting this week.She’s the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, which has clinics that provide abortions in Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada. Mansanares said the clinics should be able to accommodate people who are seeking the procedure in the wake of an Arizona Supreme Court decision.“That is still a very long way for patients to go for health care,” she added, noting that the clinics already have seen nearly 700 patients from Arizona since Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022.Doctors and clinic leaders said there’ll be a scramble across the Southwest and West for abortion care due to Tuesday’s decision, which said officials may enforce an 1864 law criminalizing all abortions except when a woman’s life is at stake.“People are going to have to start looking out of state,” said Dr. Maria Phillis, an Ohio OB-GYN who also has a law degree. “This is now another place where they can’t go safety to access care.”On top of potentially long distances to states like New Mexico, California and Colorado, patients who used to go to Arizona from other states for abortion care will have to go elsewhere, Phillis said.Plus, Arizona is home to more than 20 federally recognized tribes, and barriers are expected to be higher for Native Americans because of existing hurdles, such as a decades-old ban on most abortions at clinics and hospitals run by the federal Indian Health Service and fewer nearby health centers offering abortions.Interstate travel for abortions nearly doubled between 2020 and 2023, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. Out-of-state patients accounted for 16% of abortions obtained nationally, compared to 9% in 2020, the group said.Guttmacher data scientist Isaac Maddow-Zimet said that when bans go into effect, more people travel to less restrictive or non-restrictive states, but “not everybody is able to” travel.Traveling could mean pushing abortions later into pregnancy as people try to get appointments and potentially face mandatory waiting periods. According to results of a periodic survey spearheaded by Middlebury College economics professor Caitlin Myers, waits in several states stretched for two or three weeks at various points since federal abortion protections were overturned; some clinics had no available appointments.The Brigid Alliance works nationally to help people who need abortions receive financial and logistical support like airfare, child care, lodging and other associated costs. Last year, it helped 26 people travel out of Arizona to get abortions.Interim executive director Serra Sippel expects the number of calls from Arizona residents to grow.People that the alliance has helped go out of state — mostly from Georgia, Texas and Florida — have seen backlogs stretching to four to five weeks because of higher demand, Sippel said. Some get bounced between clinics because their pregnancy has passed the point that they can get care there.“With a pregnancy, every moment counts,” said Sippel, who added that delays can have serious repercussions. Phillis noted procedures done later in a pregnancy could take longer and be slightly more complicated.The Abortion Fund of Arizona, which helps people travel for abortions both in and out of state, said out-of-state clinics have required patients to stay to take the second pill used in medication abortions because of concerns about liability. That means multi-day trips, said Eloisa Lopez, executive director of Pro-Choice Arizona and the abortion fund.“We’re looking at anywhere from $1,000 to $2,000 per person for travel expenses, with their abortion procedure expense,” Lopez said.Lopez also said she has spoken with the governor’s office about state funding for abortion-related travel expenses.Meanwhile, in Tucson, a CEO of a pregnancy center that opposes abortion said things are likely to stay the same under the new law. Hands of Hope Tucson has been around for 43 years, is about 200 steps from a Planned Parenthood clinic and is pretty busy, CEO Joanie Hammond said.“We’re just coming alongside women and men who are facing an unexpected pregnancy … We’ve always been about the women and about the babies,” she told the AP. “At the pregnancy center, I see the women and I see what happens to them after they go through that abortion experience. We just want to be there to help them in the next step for healing and whatever they need.”For Arizona residents who are closer to California, which expanded its abortion protections after Roe v. Wade was overturned, officials are pointing people toward the Abortion Safe Haven Project. Created by the state and Los Angeles County, the project has guidance and resources for out-of-state patients.Planned Parenthood of the Pacific Southwest put out a statement this week from president and CEO Darrah DiGiorgio Johnson, saying it supports out-of-state patients with navigation services to help them tackle logistical barriers to care.This story was first published on April 10, 2024. It was updated on April 12, 2024, to correct to whom Pro-Choice Arizona spoke about funding.

"Jamie Stengle,Carla K. Johnson","A Houston hospital has halted its liver and kidney transplant programs after it says a doctor manipulated a database for liver transplant patients, making them ineligible to receive a new organ.Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center said in a statement Friday that their ongoing investigation found that a doctor had made “inappropriate changes” in a database for people awaiting liver transplants. Memorial Hermann’s statement didn’t name the doctor, but the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, or UTHealth Houston, issued a statement defending Dr. Steve Bynon, calling him ”an exceptionally talented and caring physician” with survival rates that are “among the best in the nation.”Bynon is an employee of UTHealth Houston who is contracted to Memorial Hermann. UTHealth said its faculty and staff, including Bynon, are assisting with the inquiry into Memorial Hermann’s liver transplant program and are “committed to addressing and resolving any findings identified by this process.”Memorial Hermann said a doctor made changes to the donor acceptance criteria, which includes factors like the age and weight of the deceased donors. The hospital said the inappropriate changes were only made to the liver transplant program, but since there is shared leadership over both the liver and kidney transplant programs, they inactivated both.Shutting down the transplant programs during the investigation is prudent with an “allegation of this magnitude,” said Karen Maschke, a research scholar at the Hastings Center, a medical ethics think tank. “They know full well that when they put a program on hold, it’s going to have a really serious impact on patients. So I think they probably don’t make that decision lightly.”Such allegations of manipulating a transplant waiting list can undermine the public’s trust in the organ allocation system, Maschke said.Without fairness, transparency and accountability in a transplant program “you lose, the trust of patients, but also donors,” Maschke said, “because, donors won’t want to provide organs if they think that the institution is not going to manage the allocation system fairly.”Memorial Hermann said in a statement Thursday to The New York Times that a doctor in the liver transplant program admitted to changing patient records. The newspaper identified the doctor as Bynon.The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement that they were “working across the department to address this matter.” The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, or OPTN, said it “cannot comment on any potential or ongoing review of a member organization.”The death rate for people waiting for a liver transplant at Memorial Hermann was higher than expected in recent years, according to publicly available data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, which evaluates U.S. organ transplant programs.Data from OPTN shows that four patients died or became too ill for a transplant in 2021, 11 in 2022, 14 in 2023, and so far this year, that number was at five.The UTHealth statement said that Bynon treated “patients with higher-than-average acuity and disease complexity.”Memorial Hermann said they’ve been working with patients who were on the lists to ensure they get the care they need, including being transitioned to another transplant program if necessary. Memorial Hermann also said it was working with UTHealth Houston to make changes so they can reactivate the program under different leadership.",2024-04-13 00:42:39 AM EEST,NPR,Houston hospital says doctor’s changes to a database made patients ineligible for liver transplants,https://apnews.com/article/liver-kidney-transplants-houston-f2f0b527dc314c9112c46dfc03b31983
Tom Murphy,"Johnson & Johnson is pumping more money into heart care with a roughly $13 billion deal for Shockwave Medical, which specializes in technology that helps open clogged arteries.The health care giant said Friday that it will spend $335 in cash for each share of Shockwave. The total deal value includes cash acquired.The deal has already been approved by the boards of directors from both companies.Founded in 2009, Shockwave focuses on intravascular lithotripsy technology that uses sonic pressure waves to crack calcium lesions in arteries and restore blood flow. It’s similar to a technique used to break up kidney stones. The soundwave emitters are placed inside angioplasty catheters to reach the calcified areas of the artery.Shockwave’s technology is used to treat coronary artery and peripheral artery disease.The company’s revenue jumped 49% last year to $730 million.J&J Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk told analysts on Friday that the market for this technology is still “in the early days of scaling up.” He said he sees room for more growth both in and outside the United States, and the company expects annual sales to reach at least $1 billion.J&J will use cash on hand and debt to pay for the deal. Financing costs will dilute the company’s adjusted earnings by 10 cents per share this year and 17 cents in 2025, Wolk said.The deal comes more than a year after J&J said it would spend $16 billion to buy another cardiovascular technology company, Abiomed. Both acquisitions are expected to bolster J&J’s MedTech or medical device division.That’s one of two remaining segments, along with pharmaceuticals, that the company is focused on after splitting off its consumer health division that sells Band Aids and beauty products.J&J’s Shockwave deal still needs approvals from regulators and shareholders. The companies expect to close the acquisition by the middle of this year.Shares of New Brunswick, New Jersey-based J&J edged up 32 cents to $152.82 after markets opened Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, of which J&J is a component, also rose slightly.Shockwave Medical Inc., which is based in Santa Clara, California, climbed more than $5 to $325.50.",2024-04-05 22:20:56 PM EEST,NPR,J&J to pump another $13B into its MedTech business with Shockwave deal,https://apnews.com/article/johnsonshockwavemedtechdeal-fb308f70ee276b007fa759007913ee77
Matthew Perrone,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The maker of a drug for Lou Gehrig’s disease that recently failed in a large study said Thursday it will pull the medicine from the market, acknowledging it didn’t help patients with the deadly neurological condition.Amylyx Pharmaceuticals announced it will voluntarily halt sales and marketing of the drug in the U.S. and Canada, where new patients will no longer be able to get a prescription.“While this is a difficult moment for the ALS community, we reached this path forward in partnership with the stakeholders who will be impacted and in line with our steadfast commitment to people living with ALS,” company co-founders said in a statement. Patients already taking the therapy who wish to continue will be able to enroll in a program to receive it for free.The Food and Drug Administration approved the much-debated drug, Relyvrio, in September 2022, following a years-long advocacy campaign by patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS.The drug’s failure is a bitter disappointment for patients and advocates, who have pressed the FDA and other federal agencies to fund and approve more experimental therapies for the fatal muscle-wasting disease.Relyvrio’s withdrawal leaves just three ALS medicines available to U.S. patients, only one of which has been shown to extend survival by several months.Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Amylyx also said Thursday it will lay off 70% of its more than 350 employees as part of a major restructuring effort. Company executives said they plan to continue studying Relyvrio and another experimental drug for several rare diseases, including Wolfram syndrome, which causes childhood diabetes and blindness.Company shares climbed more than 7.5% in trading Thursday morning.Amylyx said last month it was considering pulling its drug after a clinical trial in 600 patients failed to show any improvements in survival or other health measures, such as muscle strength or walking ability.The company’s voluntary action resolves what could have been a major dilemma for the FDA. The agency’s regulators would not have had a clear path to quickly force the drug from the market if the company had refused to remove it. That’s because the FDA granted the drug full approval, despite the preliminary nature of the company’s data on effectiveness.The 2022 approval was mainly based on results from one small, mid-stage study that was criticized by some of the agency’s own internal scientists. Normally the agency requires two large, late-stage studies that show a clear benefit before granting approval. But at the time FDA officials explained that “regulatory flexibility” was appropriate when reviewing Relyvrio, “given the serious and life-threatening nature of ALS and the substantial unmet need.”The medication is part of a string of drugs for deadly, degenerative diseases that have won FDA approval in recent years despite questionable evidence they work.ALS gradually destroys the nerve cells and connections needed to walk, talk, speak and breathe. Most patients die within three to five years of a diagnosis.Relyvrio is a powder that combines two older drugs: a prescription medication for liver disorders and a dietary supplement associated with traditional Chinese medicine.Amylyx faced criticism for pricing the drug at $158,000 for a year’s supply. Sales were disappointing, with some patients discontinuing the medicine after only a few months.The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Jonel Aleccia,"The federal program that helps pay for groceries for millions of low-income mothers, babies and young kids will soon emphasize more fruits, vegetables and whole grains, as well as provide a wider choice of foods from different cultures.The final rule changes for the program known as WIC were announced Tuesday by the Food and Nutrition Service, and will take effect within two years with some exceptions.Last updated a decade ago, the new WIC rules make permanent a bump in monthly cash vouchers for fruits and vegetables — something first enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Shoppers can also add canned fish, fresh herbs and lactose-free milk to their carts, among other changes. The voucher piece will take effect by June, officials said.“It places a heavy emphasis on fruits and vegetables, which we think is an important component of a healthy diet,” Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in an interview. “It’s designed to fill the nutrition gaps that are often in the diets of many of us.”The WIC program served an average of about 6.6 million low-income Americans a month in 2023 at a cost of a little more than $7 billion. It’s designed to supplement the food budgets for pregnant, nursing and postpartum women, as well as to feed babies and young kids up to age 5. That’s done by providing vouchers to mothers and children who qualify and specifically listing the amount and types of food they can buy.But officials have said only about half of those eligible are enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children.Under the new rules, fruits and vegetable vouchers in 2024 will provide $26 per month for kids ages 1 through 4; $47 per month for pregnant and postpartum women; and $52 for breastfeeding women. The changes also expand access to whole grains like quinoa, wild rice and millet and to foods such as teff and whole wheat naan. They also remove or reduce monthly allowances for juice and cut back on allowances for milk.Food plans in the program are based on recommendations from the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine and the federal 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.The plan failed to include a change requested by top allergists in the U.S. that would have added peanut products to foods allowed for babies ages 6 months to 11 months to help prevent peanut allergies.Research published in 2015 showed early introduction to peanut foods can reduce the chance of allergy development in kids who are at high risk, and several U.S. guidelines suggest exposing high-risk children to peanuts as early as 4 months.Adding peanut to the WIC guidelines may have prevented more than 34,000 infants from developing a peanut allergy, said Dr. Gideon Lack of King’s College London, who led the study. But federal nutrition officials concluded that the change was “outside the scope” of the final rule.Dr. Ruchi Gupta, a pediatrics professor and child allergy expert at Northwestern University, called the omission “disappointing.” She noted that WIC enrollees often include children of color who are at higher risk of developing dangerous peanut allergies.The decision “can only increase disparities we are already seeing in food allergy prevalence,” she said.The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Tom Murphy,"The first drug shown to slow Alzheimer’s disease hit the U.S. market over a year ago, but sales have lagged, major hospital systems have taken months to start using it and some insurers have rejected coverage.Doctors also expect some patients will hesitate to take Leqembi due to its limited impact and potential side effects. They say it will take years to learn how best to deploy the drug and that work must be done to improve diagnosis.“This is the start of a very exciting journey,” said Dr. Ambar Kulshreshtha, a suburban Atlanta family physician focused on dementia patients.More than 6 million Americans, and millions more worldwide, have Alzheimer’s disease, the most common cause of dementia. There’s no cure, but Leqembi clears a sticky brain protein called amyloid that’s a key indicator of Alzheimer’s.Studies showed that it can delay the progression of the disease by a few months when given to people with mild symptoms. Some experts say the delay may be too subtle for patients to notice.The drug also can cause brain swelling and bleeding. Patients need regular brain scans to monitor for that.The Food and Drug Administration gave Leqembi full approval last summer for patients with early stages of the disease. The federal Medicare program for people ages 65 and over covers Leqembi and the cost of scans needed to diagnose patients.The drug’s maker, Japan’s Eisai, initially expected to have 10,000 patients taking the IV drug by the end of March. Company executives have since backed off that projection, though they say sales are growing.Hospitals and health systems have needed more time than expected to set up their systems for delivering Leqembi, said Alexander Scott, an Eisai executive vice president.“It’s not like we are adding a drug to an existing system,” he said. “They are building the system for the drug.”The Cedars-Sinai health system in Los Angeles started administering the drug in early March. Getting there required months of meetings to iron out a plan to coordinate diagnosis, treatment and then monitoring for problems.“We were very careful about it,” said Dr. Sarah Kremen, a behavioral neurologist.Banner Health in Arizona also recently started using Leqembi at a couple specialty clinics in Phoenix, a spokeswoman said.“This is a very phased and staged approach,” said Dr. Alireza Atri, a neurologist who has worked as a paid consultant for Eisai. “As we learn more, we’ll expand and extend it.”The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, started using Leqembi in October but only for patients who live within a 100-mile radius so it can reach them quickly if they develop side effect symptoms. Doctors evaluate three to five patients every week for potential treatment, said Alzheimer’s expert Dr. Ron Petersen.Health systems are still trying to understand how coverage for the drug, its infusions and the needed scans works so patients don’t get stuck with bills. That’s a significant variable for a drug that can cost more than $26,000 a year.An Eisai spokeswoman said nearly three-quarters of commercial plans in the U.S. cover the drug outside Medicare.But doctors are concerned that coverage still may be tough for some patients, especially those too young to qualify for Medicare.Insurance denials delayed Scott Berkheiser’s first Leqembi infusion a few months until last December. The 57-year-old Venice, Florida, resident said the drugmaker eventually agreed to give it to him for free while he makes co-payments for the infusions.“It was a little crazy,” he said. “It seemed like it was kind of a game that must make sense for some monetary reason.”Getting treatments started on time remains another challenge.Texas Neurology had 60 patients screened as possible candidates for Leqembi and on a waitlist when the drug launched last year. Only eight eventually started treatment. The rest either declined to take it or had advanced beyond the mild phase of the disease when they were rescreened, CEO David Evans said.“That window gets very short very quick,” he said.Doctors say more must be done to quickly identify patients and get treatment started before the disease advances. But that’s a murky process.If people mention memory trouble, doctors must rule out reversible causes like thyroid problems, vitamin deficiencies, medication issues or depression, Kulshreshtha said. Then memory tests for dementia can take a few visits.Some patients may be ineligible for Leqembi because it would conflict with medication they already take to prevent strokes.And then getting in to see a neurologist who prescribes the drug can take months.Those who make it to the first infusion say the treatment process is manageable. Berkheiser says infusions have gone “like clockwork” since his delayed start.He fits them in between his work as an engineer and training six days a week to compete in an Ironman triathlon.Charles “Bum” Clegg recently finished his 13th Leqembi infusion. The Salem, Alabama, resident visits a treatment center only 15 minutes from his home.Clegg and his wife, Carol, say he has had no side effects, and his short-term memory has improved.“This drug gives you hope,” Carol said.Treatment access may improve over time. The FDA is reviewing another potential treatment that targets amyloid protein, Eli Lilly and Co.’s donanemab. Eisai is planning to seek approval for an injectable version of Leqembi that would be easier to use. Blood tests may eventually speed up amyloid detection.But researchers say there’s still a long road ahead. It’s not clear what causes Alzheimer’s disease, and many think combination treatments will be needed to stop it.“We still have a lot to learn about Alzheimer’s,” said Dr. Eric Widera a geriatric specialist with the University of California San Francisco. “It’s complex, and it’s much more than amyloid.”The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Jonel Aleccia,"A bird flu outbreak in U.S. dairy cows has grown to affect more than two dozen herds in eight states, just weeks after the nation’s largest egg producer found the virus in its chickens.Health officials stress that the risk to the public is low and that the U.S. food supply remains safe and stable.“At this time, there continues to be no concern that this circumstance poses a risk to consumer health, or that it affects the safety of the interstate commercial milk supply,” the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said in a statement.Here’s what you need to know about bird flu and food:As of Friday, the strain of bird flu that has killed millions of wild birds in recent years has been found in at least 26 dairy herds in eight U.S. states: Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas and South Dakota.The virus, known as Type A H5N1, has been detected in a range of mammals over the last few years, but this is the first time it has been found in cattle, according to federal health and animal agencies. Genetic analysis of the virus does not show that it has changed to spread more easily in people, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.Agriculture officials in at least 17 states have restricted imports of dairy cattle from states where the virus has been detected, but, so far, government agencies say it’s had little effect on commercial milk production. Officials believe cows likely have been infected by exposure to wild birds, but said cow-to-cow spread “cannot be ruled out.”Farmers are testing cows that show symptoms of infection, including sharply reduced milk supply and lethargy. Animals that show signs or test positive for illness are being separated from other animals on the farms. The animals appear to recover within two weeks.U.S. egg producers are watching the situation closely after bird flu was detected in chickens in Texas and Michigan. Millions of birds have been killed, but the FDA said the risk of affected eggs getting into the retail market or causing infections in humans is low because of federal inspections and other safeguards.Scientists say there’s no evidence to suggest that people can contract the virus by consuming food that’s been pasteurized, or heat-treated — or properly cooked.“It’s not a food safety concern,” said Lee-Ann Jaykus, an emeritus food microbiologist and virologist at North Carolina State University.Two people in U.S. have been infected with bird flu to date. A Texas dairy worker who was in close contact with an infected cow recently developed a mild eye infection and has recovered. In 2022, a prison inmate in a work program caught it while killing infected birds at a Colorado poultry farm. His only symptom was fatigue, and he recovered.Yes, according to food safety experts and government officials.U.S. producers are barred from selling milk from sick cows and must divert and destroy it. In addition, milk sold across state lines is required to be pasteurized, or heat-treated using a process that kills bacteria and viruses, including influenza.“We firmly believe that pasteurization provides a safe milk supply,” Tracey Forfa, director of the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine told a webinar audience this week.The FDA and the CDC are less certain about unpasteurized, or raw, milk sold in many states, saying there’s limited information about the possible transmission of the H5N1 virus in such products.So far, no herds linked to raw milk providers have reported cows infected with bird flu, but the agencies recommend that the industry not make or sell raw milk or raw milk cheese products made with milk from cows that show symptoms — or are exposed to infected cows.U.S. health officials have long warned against the risk of foodborne illness tied to raw milk, which the CDC said caused more than 200 outbreaks that sickened more than 2,600 people between 1998 and 2018.Still, raw milk proponents like Mark McAfee, owner of Raw Farm USA in Fresno, Calif., said the outbreak of H5N1 in commercial cows appears to have spurred higher sales of the products, despite federal warnings.Only dairy cows, not beef cattle, have been infected or shown signs of illness to date, agriculture officials said.The largest egg producer in the U.S. temporarily halted operations on April 2 after finding bird flu in its chickens. Cal-Maine Foods culled about 1.6 million laying hens and another 337,000 pullets, or young hens, after the detection.The company said there was no risk to eggs in the market and that no eggs had been recalled.Eggs that are handled properly and cooked thoroughly are safe to eat, said Barbara Kowalcyk, director of the Center for Food Safety and Nutrition Security at George Washington University.“A lot of people like runny eggs. Personally, if I eat an egg, it’s very well cooked,” she said.Still, Kowalcyk and others cautioned that the situation could change.“This is an emerging issue and clearly this pathogen is evolving and there’s a lot that we don’t know,” she said. “I do think that everybody is trying to figure it out as quickly as possible.”The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Matthew Perrone,"WASHINGTON (AP) — For decades, patients seeking medication for pain have had two choices: over-the-counter drugs like aspirin or powerful prescription opioids like oxycodone.Opioid prescriptions have plummeted over the last decade as doctors have become more attuned to the risks of addiction and misuse during the country’s ongoing drug epidemic.Vertex Pharmaceuticals recently reported positive results for a non-opioid painkiller, one of several medications the Boston-based drugmaker has been developing for various forms of pain. Patients taking the drug after surgery experienced more pain relief than those getting a placebo, although the drug didn’t meet a secondary goal of outperforming treatment with an opioid.The Associated Press spoke with Vertex’s chief scientist Dr. David Altshuler about the company’s research and development plans. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.Q: Why is Vertex interested in new drugs for treating pain?There is a great need for additional medicines to help people manage pain. There are medicines like Tylenol that are modestly effective but they’re very well tolerated. And there’s medicines such as opioids that are very effective but unfortunately have side effects, as well as addictive potential.Identifying additional medicines that could be used for people who need more pain relief but don’t want to take the risks of opioids would be helpful for society.Q: How did you develop these drugs?Vertex has been working on this for 20 years, and the insight that led to the medicines actually came from studies of people who had a rare condition where they are insensitive to pain. They can feel things, sense temperature, but do not feel pain. This was actually identified in a family of fire walkers who could walk on hot coals.So scientists figured out that that condition was due to inherited differences in a particular protein that has a role in pain signaling— so if you lack this function you don’t feel pain. So we and many others have worked for decades to make a medicine that could recapitulate that naturally-occurring phenomenon.Q: Why wouldn’t these drugs carry the same addictive properties as opioids?Addictive medicines typically work in the brain and they have side effects that aren’t really separable from the reduction in pain, because they’re the same thing. That’s their mechanism of action. In our case, our goal is to make medicines that act in the periphery, not in the brain, so they wouldn’t have the same potential risk.Q: Tell me about the recent data you’ve reported?We’ve reported three studies in people with acute pain — things like surgery or an injury — all three studies were positive, all three studies showed substantial reduction of pain of about 50%.One of the secondary endpoints was superiority to the opioid and the drugs were not superior to the opioid that was used for comparison, they were similar in magnitude. But because opioids have so many safety and tolerability issues, a medicine that could have similar efficacy but does not have those challenges might be of interest to people in pain.Q: Are you testing this approach in patients with long-term pain?We also did a study of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, which is long-term pain caused when people with diabetes have damaged nerves. That was also a positive study that showed clinically meaningful reduction in pain. So based on that study, a phase 2 study, we’re now planning for a phase 3 study.Q: What comes next?For acute pain we’re preparing to file for FDA approval based on our data. For the longer-term pain, what’s called neuropathic pain, it’s earlier in the development stage but the data is encouraging so far. So we’re continuing studies to determine if it’s possible to apply for approval there.",2024-04-16 00:23:48 AM EEST,NPR,Vertex Pharma scientist talks about the long road to developing non-addictive painkillers,https://apnews.com/article/vertex-pharmaceuticals-pain-drug-opioid-medication-study-5ec38713f486ccbab827b7dd04aa8484
"Dake Kang,Maria Cheng","BEIJING (AP) — The hunt for the origins of COVID-19 has gone dark in China, the victim of political infighting after a series of stalled and thwarted attempts to find the source of the virus that killed millions and paralyzed the world for months.The Chinese government froze meaningful domestic and international efforts to trace the virus from the first weeks of the outbreak, despite statements supporting open scientific inquiry, an Associated Press investigation found. That pattern continues to this day, with labs closed, collaborations shattered, foreign scientists forced out and Chinese researchers barred from leaving the country.The investigation drew on thousands of pages of undisclosed emails and documents and dozens of interviews that showed the freeze began far earlier than previously known and involved political and scientific infighting in China as much as international finger-pointing.As early as Jan. 6, 2020, health officials in Beijing closed the lab of a Chinese scientist who sequenced the virus and barred researchers from working with him.Scientists warn the willful blindness over coronavirus’ origins leaves the world vulnerable to another outbreak, potentially undermining pandemic treaty talks coordinated by the World Health Organization set to culminate in May.At the heart of the question is whether the virus jumped from an animal or came from a laboratory accident. A U.S. intelligence analysis says there is insufficient evidence to prove either theory, but the debate has further tainted relations between the U.S. and China.Unlike in the U.S., there is virtually no public debate in China about whether the virus came from nature or from a lab leak. In fact, there is little public discussion at all about the source of the disease, first detected in the central city of Wuhan.Crucial initial efforts were hampered by bureaucrats in Wuhan trying to avoid blame who misled the central government; the central government, which muzzled Chinese scientists and subjected visiting WHO officials to stage-managed tours; and the U.N. health agency itself, which may have compromised early opportunities to gather critical information in hopes that by placating China, scientists could gain more access, according to internal materials obtained by AP.In a faxed statement, China’s Foreign Ministry defended China’s handling of research into the origins, saying the country is open and transparent, shared data and research, and “made the greatest contribution to global origins research.” The National Health Commission, China’s top medical authority, said the country “invested huge manpower, material and financial resources” and “has not stopped looking for the origins of the coronavirus.”It could have played out differently, as shown by the outbreak of SARS, a genetic relative of COVID-19, nearly 20 years ago. China initially hid infections then, but WHO complained swiftly and publicly. Ultimately, Beijing fired officials and made reforms. The U.N. agency soon found SARS likely jumped to humans from civet cats in southern China and international scientists later collaborated with their Chinese counterparts to pin down bats as SARS’ natural reservoir.But different leaders of both China and WHO, China’s quest for control of its researchers, and global tensions have all led to silence when it comes to searching for COVID-19’s origins. Governments in Asia are pressuring scientists not to look for the virus for fear it could be traced inside their borders.Even without those complications, experts say identifying how outbreaks begin is incredibly challenging and that it’s rare to know with certainty how some viruses begin spreading.“It’s disturbing how quickly the search for the origins of (COVID-19) escalated into politics,” said Mark Woolhouse, a University of Edinburgh outbreak expert. “Now this question may never be definitively answered.”Secrecy clouds the beginning of the outbreak. Even the date when Chinese authorities first started searching for the origins is unclear.The first publicly known search for the virus took place on Dec. 31, 2019, when Chinese Center for Disease Control scientists visited the Wuhan market where many early COVID-19 cases surfaced.However, WHO officials heard of an earlier inspection of the market on Dec. 25, 2019, according to a recording of a confidential WHO meeting provided to AP by an attendee. Such a probe has never been mentioned publicly by either Chinese authorities or WHO.In the recording, WHO’s top animal virus expert, Peter Ben Embarek, mentioned the earlier date, describing it as “an interesting detail.” He told colleagues that officials were “looking at what was on sale in the market, whether all the vendors have licenses (and) if there was any illegal (wildlife) trade happening in the market.”A colleague asked Ben Embarek, who is no longer with WHO, if that seemed unusual. He responded that “it was not routine,” and that the Chinese “must have had some reason” to investigate the market. “We’ll try to figure out what happened and why they did that.”Ben Embarek declined to comment. Another WHO staffer at the Geneva meeting in late January 2020 confirmed Ben Embarek’s comments.The Associated Press could not confirm the search independently. It remains a mystery if it took place, what inspectors discovered, or whether they sampled live animals that might point to how COVID-19 emerged.A Dec. 25, 2019, inspection would have come when Wuhan authorities were aware of the mysterious disease. The day before, a local doctor sent a sample from an ill market vendor to get sequenced that turned out to contain COVID-19. Chatter about the unknown pneumonia was spreading in Wuhan’s medical circles, according to one doctor and a relative of another who declined to be identified, fearing repercussions.A scientist in China when the outbreak occurred said they heard of a Dec. 25 inspection from collaborating virologists in the country. They declined to be named out of fear of retribution.WHO said in an email that it was “not aware” of the Dec. 25 investigation. It is not included in the U.N. health agency’s official COVID-19 timeline.When China CDC researchers from Beijing arrived on Jan. 1 to collect samples at the market, it had been ordered shut and was already being disinfected, destroying critical information about the virus. Gao Fu, then head of the China CDC, mentioned it to an American collaborator.“His complaint when I met him was that all the animals were gone,” said Columbia University epidemiologist Ian Lipkin.Robert Garry, who studies viruses at Tulane University, said a Dec. 25 probe would be “hugely significant,” given what is known about the virus and its spread.“Being able to swab it directly from the animal itself would be pretty convincing and nobody would be arguing” about the origins of COVID-19, he said.But perhaps local officials simply feared for their jobs, with memories of firings after the 2003 SARS outbreak still vivid, said Ray Yip, the founding head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention outpost in China.“They were trying to save their skin, hide the evidence,” Yip said.The Wuhan government did not respond to a faxed request for comment.Another early victim was Zhang Yongzhen, the first scientist to publish a sequence of the virus. A day after he wrote a memo urging health authorities to action, China’s top health official ordered Zhang’s lab closed.“They used their official power against me and our colleagues,” Zhang wrote in an email provided to AP by Edward Holmes, an Australian virologist.On Jan. 20, 2020, a WHO delegation arrived in Wuhan for a two-day mission. China did not approve a visit to the market, but they stopped by a China CDC lab to examine infection prevention and control procedures, according to an internal WHO travel report. WHO’s then-China representative, Dr. Gauden Galea, told colleagues in a private meeting that inquiries about COVID-19’s origins went unanswered.By then, many Chinese were angry at their government. Among Chinese doctors and scientists, the sense grew that Beijing was hunting for someone to blame.“There are a few cadres who have performed poorly,” Chinese leader Xi Jinping said in unusually harsh comments in February. “Some dare not take responsibility, wait timidly for orders from above, and don’t move without being pushed.”The government opened investigations into top health officials, according to two former and current China CDC staff and three others familiar with the matter. Health officials were encouraged to report colleagues who mishandled the outbreak to Communist Party disciplinary bodies, according to two of the people.Some people both inside and outside China speculated about a laboratory leak. Those suspicious included right-wing American politicians, but also researchers close to WHO.The focus turned to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a high-level lab that experimented with some of the world’s most dangerous viruses.In early February 2020, some of the West’s leading scientists, headed by Dr. Jeremy Farrar, then at Britain’s Wellcome Trust, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, then director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, banded together to assess the origins of the virus in calls, a Slack channel and emails.They drafted a paper suggesting a natural evolution, but even among themselves, they could not agree on the likeliest scenario. Some were alarmed by features they thought might indicate tinkering.“There have (been) suggestions that the virus escaped from the Wuhan lab,” Holmes, the Australian virologist, who believed the virus originated in nature, wrote in a Feb. 7, 2020, email. “I do a lot of work in China, and I can (assure) you that a lot of people there believe they are being lied to.”American scientists close to researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology warned counterparts there to prepare.James LeDuc, head of a Texas lab, emailed his Wuhan colleague on Feb. 9, 2020, saying he’d already been approached by U.S. officials. “Clearly addressing this will be essential, with any kind of documentation you might have,” he wrote.The Chinese government was conducting its own secret investigation into the Wuhan Institute. Gao, the then-head of the China CDC, and another Chinese health expert revealed its existence in interviews months and years later. Both said the investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing, which Holmes, the Australian virologist, also heard from another contact in China. But Gao said even he hadn’t seen further details, and some experts suspect they may never be released.WHO started negotiations with China for a further visit with the virus origins in mind, but it was China’s Foreign Ministry that decided the terms.Scientists were sidelined and politicians took control. China refused a visa for Ben Embarek, then WHO’s top animal virus expert. The itinerary dropped nearly all items linked to an origins search, according to draft agendas for the trip obtained by the AP. And Gao, the then-head of the China CDC who is also a respected scientist tasked with investigating the origins, was left off the schedule.Instead, Liang Wannian, a politician in the Communist Party hierarchy, took charge of the international delegation. Liang is an epidemiologist close to top Chinese officials and China’s Foreign Ministry who is widely seen as pushing the party line, not science-backed policies, according to nine people familiar with the situation who declined to be identified to speak on a sensitive subject.Liang ruled in favor of shutting the Wuhan market at the beginning of the outbreak, according to a Chinese media interview with a top China CDC official that was later deleted. Significantly, it was Liang who promoted an implausible theory that the virus came from contaminated frozen food imported into China. Liang did not respond to an emailed request for comment.Most of the WHO delegation was not allowed to go to Wuhan, which was under lockdown. The few who did learned little. They again had no access to the Wuhan Institute of Virology or the wildlife market and obtained only scant details about China CDC efforts to trace the coronavirus there.On the train, Liang lobbied the visiting WHO scientists to praise China’s health response in their public report. Dr. Bruce Aylward, a senior adviser to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, saw it as the “best way to meet China’s need for a strong assessment of its response.”The new section was so flattering that colleagues emailed Aylward to suggest he “dial it back a bit.”“It is remarkable how much knowledge about a new virus has been gained in such a short time,” read the final report, which was reviewed by China’s top health official before it went to Tedros.As criticism of China grew, the Chinese government deflected blame. Instead of firing health officials, they declared their virus response a success and closed investigations into the officials with few job losses.“There were no real reforms, because doing reforms means admitting fault,” said a public health expert in contact with Chinese health officials who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.In late February 2020, the internationally respected doctor Zhong Nanshan appeared at a news conference and said that “the epidemic first appeared in China, but it did not necessarily originate in China.”Days later, Chinese leader Xi ordered new controls on virus research. A leaked directive from China’s Publicity Department ordered media not to report on the virus origins without permission, and a public WeChat account reposted an essay claiming the U.S. military created COVID-19 at a Fort Detrick lab and spread it to China during a 2019 athletic competition in Wuhan. Days later, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson repeated the accusation.The false claims enraged U.S. President Donald Trump, who began publicly blaming China for the outbreak, calling COVID-19 “the China virus” and the “kung-flu.”Chinese officials told WHO that blood tests on lab workers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were negative, suggesting COVID-19 wasn’t the result of a lab accident there. But when WHO pressed for an independent audit, Chinese officials balked and demanded WHO investigate the U.S. and other countries as well.By blaming the U.S., Beijing diverted blame. It was effective in China, where many Chinese were upset by racially charged criticism. But outside China, it fueled speculation of a lab leak coverup.By the time WHO led another visit to Wuhan in January 2021, a year into the pandemic, the atmosphere was toxic.Liang, the Chinese health official in charge of two earlier WHO visits, continued to promote the questionable theory that the virus was shipped into China on frozen food. He suppressed information suggesting it could have come from animals at the Wuhan market, organizing market workers to tell WHO experts no live wildlife was sold and cutting recent photos of wildlife at the market from the final report. There was heavy political scrutiny, with numerous Chinese officials who weren’t scientists or health officers present at meetings.Despite a lack of direct access, the WHO team concluded that a lab leak was “extremely unlikely.” So it was infuriating to Chinese officials when WHO chief Tedros said it was “premature” to rule out the lab leak theory, saying such lab accidents were “common,” and pressed China to be more transparent.China told WHO any future missions to find COVID-19 origins should be elsewhere, according to a letter obtained by AP. Since then, global cooperation on the issue has ground to a halt; an independent group convened by WHO to investigate the origins of COVID-19 in 2021 has been stymied by the lack of cooperation from China and other issues.Chinese scientists are still under heavy pressure, according to 10 researchers and health officials. Researchers who published papers on the coronavirus ran into trouble with Chinese authorities. Others were barred from travel abroad for conferences and WHO meetings. Gao, the then-director of the China CDC, was investigated after U.S. President Joe Biden ordered a review of COVID-19 data, and again after giving interviews on the virus origins.New evidence is treated with suspicion. In March 2023, scientists announced that genetic material collected from the market showed raccoon dog DNA mixed with COVID-19 in early 2020, data that WHO said should have been publicly shared years before. The findings were posted, then removed by Chinese researchers with little explanation.The head of the China CDC Institute of Viral Disease was forced to retire over the release of the market data, according to a former China CDC official who declined to be named to speak on a sensitive topic.“It has to do with the origins, so they’re still worried,” the former official said. “If you try and get to the bottom of it, what if it turns out to be from China?”Other scientists note that any animal from which the virus may have originally jumped has long since disappeared.“There was a chance for China to cooperate with WHO and do some animal sampling studies that might have answered the question,” said Tulane University’s Garry. “The trail to find the source has now gone cold.”Cheng reported from Geneva.",2024-04-22 20:03:16 PM EEST,NPR,Toxic: How the search for the origins of COVID-19 turned politically poisonous,https://apnews.com/article/china-covid-virus-origins-pandemic-lab-leak-bed5ab50dca8e318ab00f60b5911da0c
"Devi Shastri,Mike Stobbe","Measles outbreaks in the U.S. and abroad are raising health experts’ concern about the preventable, once-common childhood virus.One of the world’s most contagious diseases, measles can lead to potentially serious complications. The best defense, according to experts? Get vaccinated.Here’s what to know about the year — so far — in measles.Nationwide, measles cases already are nearly double the total for all of last year.The U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention documented 113 cases as of April 5. There have been seven outbreaks and most of U.S. cases — 73% — are linked to those flare-ups.Still, the count is lower than some recent years: 2014 saw 667 cases and 2019 had 1,274.The 2019 measles epidemic was the worst in almost three decades, and threatened the United States’ status as a country that has eliminated measles by stopping the continual spread of the measles virus.The CDC on Thursday released a report on recent measles case trends, noting that cases in the first three months of this year were 17 times higher than the average number seen in the first three months of the previous three years.While health officials seem to be doing a good job detecting and responding to outbreaks, “the rapid increase in the number of reported measles cases during the first quarter of 2024 represents a renewed threat to elimination,” the report’s authors said.The disease is still common in many parts of the world, and measles reaches the U.S. through unvaccinated travelers.According to Thursday’s report, most of the recent importations involved unvaccinated Americans who got infected in the Middle East and Africa and brought measles back to the U.S.Health officials confirmed measles cases in 17 states so far this year, including cases in New York City, Philadelphia and Chicago.More than half of this year’s cases come from the Chicago outbreak, where 61 people have contracted the virus as of Thursday, largely among people who lived in a migrant shelter.The city health department said Thursday that cases are on the decline after health officials administered 14,000 vaccines in just over a month.Measles is highly contagious. It spreads when people who have it breathe, cough or sneeze and through contaminated surfaces. It also can linger in the air for two hours.Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the CDC.Before a vaccine became available in 1963, there were some 3 million to 4 million cases per year, which meant nearly all American kids had it sometime during childhood, according to the CDC. Most recovered.But measles can be much more than an uncomfortable rash, said Susan Hassig, an infectious disease researcher at Tulane University.“I think that people need to remember that this is a preventable disease,” Hassig said. “It is a potentially dangerous disease for their children.”In the decade before the vaccine was available, 48,000 people were hospitalized per year. About 1,000 people developed dangerous brain inflammation from measles each year, and 400 to 500 died, according to the CDC.The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is safe and effective. It is a routine and recommended childhood vaccine that is split into two doses.Research shows it takes a very high vaccination rate to prevent measles from spreading: 95% of the population should have immunity against the virus.During the COVID-19 pandemic, national vaccination rates for kindergartners fell to 93% and remain there. Many pockets of the country have far lower rates than that. The drop is driven in part by record numbers of kids getting waivers.The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Tom Murphy,"UnitedHealth says files with personal information that could cover a “substantial portion of people in America” may have been taken in the cyberattack earlier this year on its Change Healthcare business.The company said Monday after markets closed that it sees no signs that doctor charts or full medical histories were released after the attack. But it may take several months of analysis before UnitedHealth can identify and notify people who were affected.UnitedHealth did say that some screen shots containing protected health information or personally identifiable information were posted for about a week online on the dark web, which standard browsers can’t access.The company is still monitoring the internet and dark web and said there has been no addition file publication. It has started a website to answer questions and a call center. But the company said it won’t be able to offer specifics on the impact to individual data.The company also is offering free credit monitoring and identity theft protection for people affected by the attack.UnitedHealth bought Change Healthcare in a roughly $8 billion deal that closed in 2022 after surviving a challenge from federal regulators. The U.S. Department of Justice had sued earlier that year to block the deal, arguing that it would hurt competition by putting too much information about health care claims in the hands of one company.UnitedHealth said in February that a ransomware group had gained access to some of the systems of its Change Healthcare business, which provides technology used to submit and process insurance claims.The attack disrupted payment and claims processing around the country, stressing doctor’s offices and health care systems.Federal civil rights investigators are already looking into whether protected health information was exposed in the attack.UnitedHealth said Monday that it was still restoring services disrupted by the attack. It has been focused first on restoring those that affect patient access to care or medication.The company said both pharmacy services and medical claims were back to near normal levels. It said payment process was back to about 86% of pre-attack levels.UnitedHealth said last week when it reported first-quarter results that the company has provided more than $6 billion in advance funding and interest-free loans to health care providers affected by the attack.UnitedHealth took an $872 million hit from from the cyberattack in the first quarter, and company officials said that could grow beyond $1.5 billion for the year.Minnetonka, Minnesota-based UnitedHealth Group Inc. runs one of the nation’s largest health insurers.

The agency issued an alert to doctors on Tuesday.The cases started in early November and have been reported in 11 states. The CDC said the shots were administered by unlicensed or untrained individuals or in settings like homes or spas. Most of the people said they got injections of botulinum toxin for cosmetic reasons.Six people were treated for suspected botulism, health officials said. When it gets into the bloodstream, botulinum toxin can cause botulism, a deadly disease that starts with double or blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing and difficulty breathing.Health officials said people should only get the injections from licensed professionals and report any suspected counterfeit products.The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Jonel Aleccia,"Drug regulators in Europe have found no evidence that popular diabetes and weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy are linked to a higher risk of suicidal thoughts or actions.The European Medicines Agency regulatory committee announced the results of its review on Friday. It’s the latest group to conclude there’s no known tie between a new class of obesity drugs and suicide.In January, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said a preliminary review showed no evidence of such a link, though the agency said it could not rule out that “a small risk may exist” and that it would continue to study the issue. A federally funded U.S. study also found that people taking semaglutide, the medication in Ozempic and Wegovy, had a lower risk of suicidal thoughts than those taking older medications to treat diabetes and obesity.The review by the European Union’s regulators was triggered last July by anecdotal reports that people taking the drugs had thoughts of self-harm. The regulators examined studies, post-marketing data and other research related to medications used in nearly a dozen drugs used to treat the diseases. The group did not review information regarding tirzepatide, the medication used in drugs sold as Mounjaro and Zepbound.Both agencies said they would continue to closely monitor reports of suicidal thoughts or actions in people taking the drugs known as GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Jonel Aleccia,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that samples of pasteurized milk had tested positive for remnants of the bird flu virus that has infected dairy cows.The agency stressed that the material is inactivated and that the findings “do not represent actual virus that may be a risk to consumers.” Officials added that they’re continuing to study the issue.“To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,” the FDA said in a statement.The announcement comes nearly a month after an avian influenza virus that has sickened millions of wild and commercial birds in recent years was detected in dairy cows in at least eight states. The Agriculture Department says 33 herds have been affected to date.FDA officials didn’t indicate how many samples they tested or where they were obtained. The agency has been evaluating milk during processing and from grocery stores, officials said. Results of additional tests are expected in “the next few days to weeks.”The PCR lab test the FDA used would have detected viral genetic material even after live virus was killed by pasteurization, or heat treatment, said Lee-Ann Jaykus, an emeritus food microbiologist and virologist at North Carolina State University“There is no evidence to date that this is infectious virus and the FDA is following up on that,” Jaykus said.Officials with the FDA and the USDA had previously said milk from affected cattle did not enter the commercial supply. Milk from sick animals is supposed to be diverted and destroyed. Federal regulations require milk that enters interstate commerce to be pasteurized.Because the detection of the bird flu virus known as Type A H5N1 in dairy cattle is new and the situation is evolving, no studies on the effects of pasteurization on the virus have been completed, FDA officials said. But past research shows that pasteurization is “very likely” to inactivate heat-sensitive viruses like H5N1, the agency added.Matt Herrick, a spokesman for the International Dairy Foods Association, said that time and temperature regulations for pasteurization ensure that the commercial U.S. milk supply is safe. Remnants of the virus “have zero impact on human health,” he wrote in an email.Scientists confirmed the H5N1 virus in dairy cows in March after weeks of reports that cows in Texas were suffering from a mysterious malady. The cows were lethargic and saw a dramatic reduction in milk production. Although the H5N1 virus is lethal to commercial poultry, most infected cattle seem to recover within two weeks, experts said.To date, two people in U.S. have been infected with bird flu. A Texas dairy worker who was in close contact with an infected cow recently developed a mild eye infection and has recovered. In 2022, a prison inmate in a work program caught it while killing infected birds at a Colorado poultry farm. His only symptom was fatigue, and he recovered.The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Jonel Aleccia,"The nation’s school meals will get a makeover under new nutrition standards that limit added sugars for the first time, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Wednesday.The final rule also trims sodium in kids’ meals, although not by the 30% first proposed in 2023. And it continues to allow flavored milks — such as chocolate milk — with less sugar, rather than adopting an option that would have offered only unflavored milk to the youngest kids.The aim is to improve nutrition and align with U.S. dietary guidelines in the program that provides breakfasts to more than 15 million students and lunches to nearly 30 million students every day at a cost of about $22.6 billion per year.“All of this is designed to ensure that students have quality meals and that we meet parents’ expectations,” Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told reporters.The limits on added sugars would be required in the 2025-2026 school year, starting with high-sugar foods such as cereal, yogurt and flavored milk. By the fall of 2027, added sugars in school meals would be limited to no more than 10% of the total calories per week for breakfasts and lunches, in addition to limites on sugar in specific products.Officials had proposed to reduce sodium in school meals by as much as 30% over the next several years. But after receiving mixed public comments and a directive from Congress included in the fiscal year 2024 appropriations bill approved in March, the agency will reduce sodium levels allowed in breakfasts by 10% and in lunches by 15% by the 2027-2028 school year.—The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Lauran Neergaard,"NEW YORK (AP) — Doctors have transplanted a pig kidney into a New Jersey woman who was near death, part of a dramatic pair of surgeries that also stabilized her failing heart.Lisa Pisano’s combination of heart and kidney failure left her too sick to qualify for a traditional transplant, and out of options. Then doctors at NYU Langone Health devised a novel one-two punch: Implant a mechanical pump to keep her heart beating and days later transplant a kidney from a genetically modified pig.Pisano is recovering well, the NYU team announced Wednesday. She’s only the second patient ever to receive a pig kidney -- following a landmark transplant last month at Massachusetts General Hospital – and the latest in a string of attempts to make animal-to-human transplantation a reality.This week, the 54-year-old grasped a walker and took her first few steps.“I was at the end of my rope,” Pisano told The Associated Press. “I just took a chance. And you know, worst case scenario, if it didn’t work for me, it might have worked for someone else and it could have helped the next person.”Dr. Robert Montgomery, director of NYU Langone Transplant Institute, recounted cheers in the operating room as the organ immediately started making urine.“It’s been transformative,” Montgomery said of the experiment’s early results.But “we’re not off the hook yet,” cautioned Dr. Nader Moazami, the NYU cardiac surgeon who implanted the heart pump.“With this surgery I get to see my wife smile again,” Pisano’s husband Todd said Wednesday.Other transplant experts are closely watching how the patient fares.“I have to congratulate them,” said Dr. Tatsuo Kawai of Mass General, who noted that his own pig kidney patient was healthier overall going into his operation than NYU’s patient. “When the heart function is bad, it’s really difficult to do a kidney transplant.”More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant waiting list, most who need a kidney, and thousands die waiting. In hopes of filling the shortage of donated organs, several biotech companies are genetically modifying pigs so their organs are more humanlike, less likely to be destroyed by people’s immune system.NYU and other research teams have temporarily transplanted pig kidneys and hearts into brain-dead bodies, with promising results. Then the University of Maryland transplanted pig hearts into two men who were out of other options, and both died within months.Mass General’s pig kidney transplant last month raised new hopes. Kawai said Richard “Rick” Slayman experienced an early rejection scare but bounced back enough to go home earlier this month and still is faring well five weeks post-transplant. A recent biopsy showed no further problems.Pisano is the first woman to receive a pig organ — and unlike with prior xenotransplant experiments, both her heart and kidneys had failed. She went into cardiac arrest and had to be resuscitated before the experimental surgeries. She’d gotten too weak to even play with her grandchildren. “I was miserable,” the Cookstown, New Jersey, woman said.A failed heart made her ineligible for a traditional kidney transplant. But while on dialysis, she didn’t qualify for a heart pump, called a left ventricular assist device or LVAD, either.“It’s like being in a maze and you can’t find a way out,” Montgomery explained — until the surgeons decided to pair a heart pump with a pig kidney.With emergency permission from the Food and Drug Administration, Montgomery chose an organ from a pig genetically engineered by United Therapeutics Corp. so its cells don’t produce a particular sugar that’s foreign to the human body and triggers immediate organ rejection.Plus a tweak: The donor pig’s thymus gland, which trains the immune system, was attached to the donated kidney in hopes that it would help Pisano’s body tolerate the new organ.Surgeons implanted the LVAD to power Pisano’s heart on April 4, and transplanted the pig kidney on April 12. There’s no way to predict her long-term outcome but she’s shown no sign of organ rejection so far, Montgomery said. And in adjusting the LVAD to work with her new kidney, Moazami said doctors already have learned lessons that could help future care of heart-and-kidney patients.Special “compassionate use” experiments teach doctors a lot but it will take rigorous studies to prove if xenotransplants really work. What happens with Pisano and Mass General’s kidney recipient will undoubtedly influence FDA’s decision to allow such trials. United Therapeutics said it hopes to begin one next year.The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

"Fred Ooko,Desmond Tiro","MIGORI, Kenya (AP) — As the coffin bearing the body of Rosebella Awuor was lowered into the grave, heart-wrenching sobs from mourners filled the air. Her sister Winnie Akinyi, the guardian to Awuor’s orphaned son, fell to the ground, wailing.It was the latest of five deaths in this family attributed to malaria. The disease is common in Kenya, and it is preventable and curable, but poverty makes it deadly for those who can’t afford treatment.In the family’s compound in the western county of Migori, three other graves are visible, that of Awuor’s husband and their other two children who died from malaria before the age of 2.Awuor, 31, fell ill in December and lost her five-month pregnancy before succumbing to malaria. Her 11-year-old son is the family’s only survivor.Malaria is still a significant public health challenge in Kenya, though some progress may be coming. Parts of Kenya participated in an important pilot of the world’s first malaria vaccine, with a reported drop in deaths for children under 5. Kenya’s health ministry hasn’t said when the vaccine will be widely available.The biggest impact is felt in regions characterized by high temperatures like Kenya’s Indian Ocean coast, and places with high rainfall like the western region near Lake Victoria.Kenya had an estimated 5 million malaria cases and over 12,000 deaths reported in 2022, according to the World Health Organization.Most of those affected are children under 5 and pregnant women.Kenya continues to combat malaria with traditional methods such as distributing bed nets that are treated with insecticides, spraying breeding areas, and promoting prompt diagnosis and treatment, but experts say progress against the disease with those approaches has plateaued.Public health expert Dr. Willis Akhwale, special adviser for the Kenya End Malaria Council, said the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down distribution of drugs and treatment.He said innovative treatment methods are needed in the wake of drug resistant cases reported in parts of Africa.“We need to start looking at investments in new generation medicines. That should then be able to counter any resistance in (the) foreseeable future,” he said.Akhwale said other needs include more funding and logistical support.“In Kenya the shortfall in terms of the need is almost $52 million, so we need to close that gap,” he said, citing health ministry data. He recommended domestic funding and private sector support amid donor fatigue with crises around the world.Wilson Otieno has been admitted to a hospital three times for malaria and has received outpatient treatment countless times. It’s expensive for the 33-year-old accountant and father in the lakeside city of Kisumu.Malaria is never “pocket friendly,” he said.Some progress has been made with local manufacturing of crucial medication.The Kenya-based Universal Corporation Limited last year received the WHO’s approval to produce an antimalarial drug known as Spaq, a combination of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine.The approval was an important step in Africa’s capacity to make lifesaving medications, a new focus for governments and public health officials after vulnerabilities were exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Africa relies heavily on drug imports.“It will really help in lowering the dependency for imports as we saw during the COVID era, where whatever was being imported actually had huge supply disruptions,” said Palu Dhanani, the founder and managing director of UCL.If you don’t get the right medicine at the right time, malaria can cause unnecessary deaths, Dhanani said.Tiro reported from Nairobi, Kenya.

Regina Garcia Cano,"PUTUCUAL, Venezuela (AP) — Some of the 10 women and teenage girls who recently came to a medical clinic in eastern Venezuela for free contraceptives fidgeted a bit when a community health worker taught them how to use an IUD, condoms and birth control pills correctly.The health worker also asked what they knew about HPV, the most common sexually transmitted infection in the world and the cause of nearly all cervical cancer. Of the 10, ages 16 to 33 — two of whom had traveled to Putucual by boat and bus — only one had learned about human papillomavirus in middle school. The rest had talked about it with friends or cousins, but never their parents.None knew HPV vaccines exist, even though Venezuelan pediatricians have long recommended giving all children the vaccine starting at age 9.Venezuela’s government has repeatedly broken its promise to provide the shots for free, and many public-school teachers have failed to implement the requirement to teach sex ed. President Nicolás Maduro ‘s administration claims the well-being of youth and women is a priority, but the onus is on parents to talk to their kids about HPV and pay for the vaccines at private clinics. That’s out of reach for most in a country where private-sector workers earn $202 a month on average, and public employees’ monthly minimum wage is $3.60 plus $100 in bonuses.Most HPV infections are asymptomatic and go away without treatment. But some can lead to genital warts and cancers, primarily of the cervix, but also of the anus, penis and throat.Official health care statistics are elusive in Venezuela, making it virtually impossible to know the rate of HPV infection or how many people have been vaccinated either privately or by nongovernmental organizations. HPV vaccine coverage estimates from the World Health Organization show a blank space for Venezuela.In 2022, Maduro’s administration estimated 30% of Venezuelan women are affected by cancer-causing strains of HPV. But the Ministry of Popular Power for Health did not publicly provide the data nor historical figures to show how the rate may have changed.Health care professionals in the South American country told The Associated Press that the government’s figure is an undercount.“With HPV, all governments have a social and moral debt to the female population,” said Dr. Carlos Cabrera, an OB-GYN in private practice and director of the maternal fetal medicine program at the Central University of Venezuela. “But people don’t like to talk about sexual and reproductive health.”When HPV shots first hit the market in the mid-2000s, the oil-dependent state’s coffers were flush. The price of oil — Venezuela’s most valuable resource — was steadily climbing and the country produced more than a million barrels a day. In 2009, doctors urged the government of President Hugo Chávez to introduce the HPV vaccine into the country, but they were ignored.In 2015, Ministry of Health officials appeared ready to start offering HPV shots, mentioning in the agency’s annual performance report that the country’s vaccine schedule would include them and they “would be administered starting in 2016.” By this time, Venezuela’s budget holes due to financial mismanagement were apparent, but U.S. economic sanctions had not yet crippled the oil industry.Venezuela’s last vaccine promise came in late 2022 after it reached an agreement with GAVI, a public-private global alliance that helps poor countries procure vaccinations. Government officials said shipments were expected for 2023, but no shots were distributed then, and they are also not listed among those being offered during national vaccination week.The Ministry of Popular Power for Communication and Information did not respond to questions from the AP about the status of the vaccines, including reasons for the delay.GAVI, whose assistance is time-limited and requires government funding commitments, said in a statement that Venezuela “reconfirmed its ... intent” to introduce the HPV vaccine in November 2023. It did not answer the AP’s question about when it expected the first shots to arrive, saying only that rolling out vaccines takes preparation time.The health ministry’s vaccination schedule still does not list the HPV vaccine. But that has not stopped state television from occasionally airing a two-minute cartoon of a Maduro-lookalike superhero — “Super Mustache” — whose adversaries are accused of wanting to “destroy everything” in Venezuela, including the “vaccines for the youngest women.” Globally, girls and young women are the primary demographic for the HPV shot.Private practices in Venezuela that obtain the vaccine through importers sell it for $100 or more, depending on the brand and city, and recommend one or two boosters — which cost extra. Very few can afford that: Paychecks of public and private-sector employees aren’t enough to cover a month of food for a family of four, which exceeds $350.Awareness about HPV is another issue: public schools used to teach about STIs and gave students a chance to ask questions that they might not have felt comfortable bringing to their parents, but educators now largely ignore the requirement to teach the subject — either due to personal beliefs or because meager pay forces teachers to find second or third jobs, to the point that they’re not in the classroom five days a week.“In theory, on paper, we have a decent sex education program that adheres to international standards, with correct messages,” said Dr. Lila Vega, a pediatrician and member of the Network of Mothers, Fathers and Representatives of Venezuela, an NGO that promotes the participation of parents and guardians in schools. “But in reality, we are not even teaching addition and subtraction, and sex education is not a priority.”Under Chávez, the ministries of education and culture edited and printed several free textbooks. “Life and Comprehensive Health” for seventh graders had lengthy explanations on teen pregnancy, birth control methods and the cancer risks posed by HPV infections. It included an image of “possible lesions caused by HPV.”Maduro’s administration last printed the textbooks in 2015. Education officials later set up a digital library to which teachers can refer students, but the health book was never uploaded. Some teachers still share a PDF version of the book with their students, and others refer kids to old copies in school libraries.Adriana Yeguez, 33, who participated in the session at the clinic in Putucual run by the global medical charity Doctors Without Borders, believes adolescents like her 16-year-old son need more information than what they can get on their own or at school. So, she and her partner are talking to him about HPV.“We do talk to him, especially about infections,” Yeguez said. “What if he gets one? Imagine that! What if there’s no cure or treatment? What if we don’t have money?”In some Latin American countries, studies showed a lack of parental knowledge about HPV was an obstacle to vaccination. And in Venezuela, physicians say parents and governments also resist the vaccine due to cultural taboos and the false notion that girls will see it as a ticket to promiscuity.The vaccine prevents more than 90% of cancers caused by HPV. Yuly Remolina, a researcher and oncologist in Mexico City, believes that statistic is the best argument for why governments should provide the shots and parents and young adults should seek them out.“It is incredible to continue seeing young patients with cervical cancer who cannot be operated on, who have to be given chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and who end up dying of it,” said Remolina, who sees patients from Venezuela, Colombia and other Latin American countries.It’s why Daniel Rojas, a community health worker at the Putucual clinic, urged the women and teens to seek medical attention if they suspect an HPV infection: “Don’t let the days go by just thinking ‘Maybe yes, maybe no.’”",2024-04-25 11:36:23 AM EEST,NPR,"Venezuela broke its HPV vaccine promises, and there’s barely any sex ed.

The attack disrupted payment and claims processing around the country, stressing doctor’s offices and health care systems.Federal civil rights investigators are looking into whether protected health information was exposed in the attack.UnitedHealth is still restoring several services from the February attack. It took an $872 million hit from it in the first quarter, but CEO Andrew Witty told analysts on Tuesday that the company expected to bring Change Healthcare back “much stronger than it was before.”UnitedHealth also booked a roughly $7 billion charge in the quarter for selling a Brazilian health benefits and care provider it bought more than a decade ago.Overall the company lost $1.41 billion in the first quarter. Total revenue grew more than 8% to $99.8 billion.Adjusted earnings totaled $6.91 per share. That excluded the cost from the sale of the Brazilian business and some of expenses tied to the cyberattack.Analysts expected earnings of $6.61 per share on $99.23 billion in revenue.UnitedHealth provides health insurance for more than 49 million people in the United States. Its Optum segment also provides care, runs one of the nation’s largest pharmacy benefits management businesses and offers technology services.Total costs tied to the cyberattack and recovery amounted to 74 cents per share in the quarter. About two-thirds of that, or 49 cents, was direct response costs that the company excluded from adjusted earnings.That includes increased medical expenses the company incurred from suspending its pre-approval or prior authorization requirements for some care.UnitedHealth expects the full impact of the cyberattack will amount to a hit of between $1.15 to $1.35 per share to earnings this year.The Minnetonka, Minnesota, company on Tuesday also reaffirmed a 2024 earnings forecast it first laid out last fall for adjusted earnings of $27.50 to $28 per share.Analysts expect earnings of $27.50 per share.Company shares climbed more than 5% to $469.04 in midday trading Tuesday.

Devi Shastri,"Allergy season can bring misery to tens of millions of Americans each year.Tree, grass, and other pollens can cause runny noses, itchy eyes, coughing and sneezing.Where you live and what you’re allergic to can make a big difference in how bad your allergies are, but there are many things you can do to feel better.Here are some tips from experts to keep allergies at bay — maybe even enough to allow you to enjoy the outdoors.There are three main types of pollen. Earlier in the spring, tree pollen is the main culprit. After that grasses pollinate, followed by weeds in the late summer and early fall.Some of the most common tree pollens that cause allergies include birch, cedar, cottonwood, maple, elm, oak and walnut, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. Grasses that cause symptoms include Bermuda, Johnson, rye and Kentucky bluegrass.The best and first step to controlling allergies is avoiding exposure. That’s easier said than done when it’s nice out.Start with keeping your windows closed at home and in the car, avoiding going out when pollen counts are highest and changing clothes when you get home. The same masks that got us through the pandemic can protect you from allergies — though they won’t help with eye symptoms.Pollen trackers can help with planning. The American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology tracks levels through a network of counting stations across the U.S. Counts are available at its website and via email.You can’t fight an enemy you don’t know.Since many Americans are allergic to several things at once, the first thing to figure out is what specifically you’re allergic to, said Dr. Nana Mireku, an allergist in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.Over-the-counter nasal sprays can help relieve symptoms, but they take a while to kick in, so it’s best to start them in early in the season, said Dr. Rachna Shah, an allergist and director of the Loyola Medicine Allergy Count.Antihistamines are another option. Shah said she’s seen some patients benefit from switching to a similar brand if one stops working, but said that there isn’t much broader data to back the recommendation.For young children and people who have to take many different allergy medications, immunotherapies in the form of shots and oral drops can help desensitize the immune system to allergens, treating symptoms at their root.The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America issues an annual ranking of the most challenging cities to live in if you have allergies, based on over-the-counter medicine use, pollen counts and the number of available allergy specialists. This year, the top five were Wichita, Kansas; Virginia Beach, Virginia; Greenville, South Carolina; Dallas; and Oklahoma City.If you’ve been thinking it started earlier and seems longer this year, you’re on to something.Shah usually starts looking at pollen counts in the Chicago area in April. But this year, she peeked at her data in mid-February, and tree pollen was already at a “moderate” level.“This season has been so nuts,” she said. “Granted, it was a pretty mild winter, but I didn’t expect it to be so early.”Shah said she believes this season will be longer than other years, assuming the weather remains warm.Experts say climate change has led to longer and more intense allergy seasons.The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

None,"IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) — Longtime Iowa football broadcaster Ed Podolak announced Monday he will move out of the radio booth this season and limit his appearances to pregame shows and podcasts.Podolak played quarterback and running back for the Hawkeyes before he became a fixture at running back for the Kansas City Chiefs from 1969-77. He was a color commentator for NBC and ESPN before he joined the Iowa radio team in 1982. He worked nearly 500 games alongside play-by-play men Jim Zabel and Gary Dolphin.“I have said it often across 27 years that Ed Podolak is the best I’ve ever worked with in the broadcast booth,” Dolphin said. “One of the game’s great competitors, Ed’s ability to explain plays was unparalleled. Football mentalities of all ages understood and enjoyed the humor each Saturday. I look forward to Eddie’s continued involvement on game day.”Podolak, 76, said in a statement he decided the time was right to step back from some of his broadcasting duties.“I believe there is no greater honor than to be part of the Iowa Hawkeye Football team,” he said. “I have loved watching these young men and coaches compete for the past 42 years. Sharing my perspective for the incredible Hawkeye fans from coast to coast has been a thrill.”Podolak was named first-team All-Big Ten and team MVP in 1968, when he set a then-conference record with 286 yards on 17 rushing attempts against Northwestern. He had nearly 4,500 yards rushing and 2,500 yards receiving and a combined 40 touchdowns in 104 games for the Chiefs.

Jonel Aleccia,"Dairy cattle moving between states must be tested for the bird flu virus, U.S. agriculture officials said Wednesday as they try to track and control the growing outbreak.The federal order was announced one day after health officials said they had detected inactivated remnants of the virus, known as Type A H5N1, in samples taken from milk during processing and from store shelves. They stressed that such remnants pose no known risk to people or the milk supply.“The risk to humans remains low,” said Dawn O’Connell of the federal Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response.The new order, which goes into effect Monday, requires every lactating cow to be tested and post a negative result before moving to a new state. It will help the agency understand how the virus is spreading, said Michael Watson, an administrator with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.“We believe we can do tens of thousands of tests a day,” he told reporters.Until now, testing had been done voluntarily and only in cows with symptoms.Avian influenza was first detected in dairy cows in March and has been found in nearly three dozen herds in eight states, according to USDA.It’s an escalation of an ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza spread by wild birds. Since the start of the outbreak, more than 90 million birds in U.S. commercial flocks have either died from the virus or been killed to try to prevent spread.Two people in the U.S. — both farmworkers — have been infected with bird flu since the outbreak began. Health officials said 23 people have been tested for bird flu to date and 44 people exposed to infected animals are being monitored.Officials said that samples from a cow in Kansas showed that the virus could be adapting to more animals and they detected H5N1 virus in the lung tissue of a dairy cow that had been culled and sent to slaughter.So far, officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have seen no signs that the virus is changing to be more transmissible to people.The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Mark Kennedy,"NEW YORK (AP) — The ambiguity of Imagine Dragons’ next album starts from the cover.Two figures stand in the distance separated by a dawning sun. Or is it setting? Lead singer and songwriter Dan Reynolds, who dreamed it up, sees it both ways.“You can’t really tell if it’s a sunset or a sunrise, and then there are two people kind of separated standing in front of it. That really kind of sums it up thematically when I listen to it,” he tells The Associated Press.“Is the beginning of something new, or is this the end of something? And the sunset and the sunrise always kind of feels that way to me. It could be either/or.”From the paranoid, slightly demented hip-hop-rock opening song “Wake Up” — with Reynolds singing: “Everybody’s coming for you/Wake up!” — to the strummy, swaying “Take Me to the Beach,” it’s clear the nine-track album called “Loom” isn’t one thing. The album comes out June 28.It’s the first album since Reynolds’ divorce from musician Aja Volkman and there are songs about moving on — the sunny flirtatious “Nice to Meet Ya” — but also looking behind, like the bittersweet “In Your Corner” — “You turned your back/And now we’re here” — and “Don’t Forget Me,” with the lyrics “Guess we got lost in the light.”“I just start creating and whatever comes out is what it is. That’s how I’ve been since I was 12. I try not to overthink it,” says Reynolds. “It’s just an honest output sonically, lyrically of how I’m feeling in the moment.”For the driving, anthemic “Kid,” Reynolds says he came into the studio with his life a little chaotic. He just spoke words that he was feeling over a drum loop: “You got to get yourself together, kid/You got to get it together.” Then the band started building. The song, inspired by the ’90s music he loves, like by Gorillaz, became an exhortation for America, so adding a choir made sense.“We had a lot of fun creating that one in the studio. I love the juxtaposition of things that are kind of tongue-in-cheek, but also maybe dark,” he says. “Heavy concepts, but playful at the same time.”“Loom” was recorded in a new way for Imagine Dragons, which includes guitarist Wayne Sermon, bassist Ben McKee and drummer Daniel Platzman. For one thing, the band abandoned their usual preference for multiple producers in favor of just one — the Swedish duo of Mattman & Robin.Another change was approaching it fresh. “We usually go into the record having a bunch of demos that we’ve already just self-produced and done on our own,” Reynolds says. “But this one we had a bunch of demos and we just scrapped everything and went in with a clean slate.”“Loom” comes two years after “Mercury,” a brooding, raw confessional double album that dealt with heartache, tragedy and Reynolds’ struggles with sobriety.“Eyes Closed,” the new album’s first single, signals a change, with a big stormy banger and the chest-pounding lyrics: “I’m back from the dead, from the back of my head/Been gone and facin’ horrors that should never be said.”Reynolds says he was going for a blustery, arrogant vibe but revealing a vulnerable core. “It really was about being something that on the outside looks put together and strong,” he says, “but on the inside it’s on the verge of maybe shattering.”The title of the album — “Loom” — has multiple meanings. “Just because something is looming doesn’t necessarily mean it’s bad. It could be good,” he says. “I also love the idea of the double meaning of it, kind of being a tapestry.”The Dragons will tour across North America in support of “Loom,” kicking off June 30 in Camden, New Jersey, at Freedom Mortgage Pavilion and hitting such cities at Dallas, Seattle; Toronto; West Palm Beach, Florida; Denver; Charlotte, North Carolina; Phoenix; Salt Lake City; and concluding on Oct. 22 at the Hollywood Bowl.Reynolds says touring is deep within Imagine Dragons’ DNA and speaks about playing live as if it were a massive therapeutic effort, which their shows often become.“It’s just a lot of people in a room together realizing they’re not alone in their their feelings,” he says. “I don’t necessarily need them to feel happy or sad or anything. I just want them to look around them and see that other people are also feeling something and feeling, ‘I’m not alone in that.’”Songs from “Loom” will make the setlist, of course. Reynolds considers it one of the band’s most up-tempo collections, even though there are ballads and slow moments.“A lot of the record is kind trying to come to terms with just accepting. Things are looming and incoming, for better or for worse, and there’s just really nothing you could do other than accept it,” he says. “I still haven’t learned to do that, but we will.”Mark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits",2024-04-22 18:30:47 PM EEST,NPR,Imagine Dragons’ Dan Reynolds talks new album ‘Loom’ — ‘Heavy concepts but playful at the same time’,https://apnews.com/article/imagine-dragons-loom-dan-reynolds-aafe123392849c09221233341bf3d249
Joshua Goodman,"MIAMI (AP) — A leading fashion designer whose accessories were used by celebrities from Britney Spears to the cast of the “Sex and the City” TV series was sentenced Monday to 18 months in prison after pleading guilty in Miami federal court on charges of smuggling crocodile handbags from her native Colombia.Nancy Gonzalez was arrested in 2022 in Cali, Colombia, and later extradited to the U.S. for running a sprawling multiyear conspiracy that involved recruiting couriers to transport her handbags on commercial flights to high-end showrooms and New York fashion events — all in violation of U.S. wildlife laws.“It’s all driven by the money,” said Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Watts-Fitzgerald, who compared Gonzalez’s behavior to that of drug traffickers. “If you want to deter the conduct, you want the cocaine kingpin, not the person in the field.”Lawyers for Gonzalez sought leniency for the celebrity designer, describing her journey as a divorced single mother of two children who designed belts on a home sewing machine in Cali for friends into a fashion icon who outcompeted the likes of Dior, Prada and Gucci.“She was determined to show her children and the world that women, including minority women like herself, can pursue their dreams successfully, and become financially independent,” they wrote in a memo prior to Monday’s hearing. “Against all odds, this tiny but mighty woman was able to create the very first luxury, high-end fashion company from a third world country.”The attorneys said the 71-year-old designer has already paid dearly for her crimes. The Colombian company she built, which once employed 300 mostly female employees, declared bankruptcy and stopped operating after her arrest.They also argued that only 1% of the merchandise she imported into the U.S. lacked proper authorization and were samples for New York Fashion week and other events.Gonzalez, addressing the court before sentencing, said she deeply regretted not meticulously complying with U.S. laws and that her only wish is to hug once more her 103-year-old mother.“From the bottom of my heart, I apologize to the United States of America. I never intended to offend a country to which I owe immense gratitude,” she said holding back tears. “Under pressure, I made poor decisions.”Prosecutors countered that Gonzalez had acquired great wealth and an opulent lifestyle, which contrasted with the couriers she recruited to smuggle her merchandise into the United States. The couriers were instructed to say that the items were gifts for their relatives if they were asked any questions by customs agents.“Her mission turned into producing felons,” said Watts-Fitzgerald. “She tried to rewrite the law for herself, to do it her way.”According to the testimony of her co-defendants and former employees, ahead of important fashion events, Gonzalez, described as a micro-manager, would recruit as many as 40 passengers to carry four designer handbags each on commercial flights. In this way, prosecutors estimate that she smuggled goods that fetched as much as $2 million in the U.S. Gonzalez’s attorneys disputed the claim and said each skin cost only around $140.All of the hides were from caiman and pythons bred in captivity. Nonetheless, on some occasions she failed to obtain the proper import authorizations from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, required under a widely ratified international treaty governing the trade in endangered and threatened wildlife species.In 2016 and 2017, she was warned by U.S. officials against sidestepping such rules, making her conduct particularly “egregious,” Judge Robert Scola said in handing down his sentence.Prosecutors had been seeking a stiffer sentence of 30 to 37 months. But Scola said he was taking into account the nearly 14 months she spent in harsher conditions in a Colombian prison awaiting extradition. Gonzalez, who has been free on a bond under confinement at her daughter’s home in Miami, must surrender June 6 to begin her sentence.Although trade in the skins used by Gonzalez was not prohibited, they came from protected wildlife that requires close monitoring under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, known by its initials as CITES.Salma Hayek, Britney Spears and Victoria Beckham are among celebrities who bought Gonzalez’s carefully crafted handbags. Her work also was included in a 2008 exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.Gonzalez’s attorneys showed in court a video, from 2019, of top buyers from Bergdorf Goodman, Saks and others praising the designer’s creativity, productivity and humanity — comments prosecutor Watts-Fitzgerald said the retailers likely regret today.“They must be regretting they were ever put up to that and if they heard it was presented in court they would cringe,” said Watts-Fitzgerald. “They have their own brand to protect.”",2024-04-22 20:11:50 PM EEST,NPR,Celebrity handbag designer sentenced to 18 months in prison for smuggling crocodile handbags,https://apnews.com/article/fashion-designer-sentenced-nancy-gonzalez-d636a371d13bb1a912adc89679a80c0d
Edith M. Lederer,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Nearly 282 million people in 59 countries suffered from acute hunger in 2023, with war-torn Gaza as the territory with the largest number of people facing famine, according to the Global Report on Food Crises released Wednesday.The U.N. report said 24 million more people faced an acute lack of food than in 2022, due to the sharp deterioration in food security, especially in the Gaza Strip and Sudan. The number of nations with food crises that are monitored has also been expanded.Máximo Torero, chief economist for the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization, said 705,000 people in five countries are at Phase 5, the highest level, on a scale of hunger determined by international experts — the highest number since the global report began in 2016 and quadruple the number that year.Over 80% of those facing imminent famine — 577,000 people — were in Gaza, he said. South Sudan, Burkina Faso, Somalia and Mali each host many thousands also facing catastrophic hunger.According to the report’s future outlook, around 1.1 million people in Gaza, where the Israel-Hamas war is now in its seventh month, and 79,000 in South Sudan are projected to be in Phase 5 and facing famine by July.It said conflict will also continue to drive food insecurity in Haiti, where gangs control large portions of the capital.Additionally, while the El Nino phenomenon peaked in early 2024, “its full impact on food security – including flooding and poor rain in parts of east Africa and drought in southern Africa, especially Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe – are like to manifest throughout the year.”U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the report “a roll call of human failings,” and that “in a world of plenty, children are starving to death.”“The conflicts erupting over the past 12 months compound a dire global situation,” he wrote in the report’s foreword.Guterres highlighted the conflict in the Gaza Strip, as the enclave holds the highest number of people facing catastrophic hunger. There is also the year-old conflict in Sudan, which has created the world’s largest internal displacement crisis “with atrocious impacts on hunger and nutrition,” he added.According to the report, over 36 million people in 39 countries and territories are facing an acute hunger emergency, a step below the famine level in Phase 4, with more than a third in Sudan and Afghanistan. It’s an increase of a million people from 2022, the report said.Arif Husain, the U.N. World Food Program’s chief economist, said every year since 2016 the numbers of people acutely food insecure have gone up, and they are now more than double the numbers before the COVID-19 pandemic.While the report looks at 59 countries, he said the target is to get data from 73 countries where there are people who are acutely food insecure.Secretary-General Guterres called for an urgent response to the report’s findings that addresses the underlying causes of acute hunger and malnutrition while transforming the systems that supply food. Funding is also not keeping pace with the needs, he stressed.“We must have the funding, and we also must have the access,” WFP’s Husain said, stressing that both “go hand-in-hand” and are essential to tackle acute food insecurity.The report is the flagship publication of the Food Security Information Network and is based on a collaboration of 16 partners including U.N. agencies, regional and multinational bodies, the European Union, the U.S. Agency for International Development, technical organizations and others.",2024-04-25 08:47:39 AM EEST,NPR,"UN report says 282 million people faced acute hunger in 2023, with the worst famine in Gaza",https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-acute-global-hunger-gaza-sudan-4cf3f8730a755c5324d667cb72d1c503
Hillel Italie,"NEW YORK (AP) — Facing widespread unhappiness over its response to the Israel-Hamas war, the writers’ group PEN America has called off its annual awards ceremony. Dozens of nominees had dropped out of the event, which was to have taken place next week.PEN, a literary and free expression organization, hands out hundreds of thousands of dollars in prizes each year, including $75,000 for the PEN/Jean Stein Award for best book. But with nine of the 10 Jean Stein finalists withdrawing, along with nominees in categories ranging from translation to poetry, continuing with the ceremony at The Town Hall in Manhattan proved unworkable.Among those dropping out was debut novel finalist Rachel Eliza Griffiths, wife of former PEN president Salman Rushdie.“This is a beloved event and an enormous amount of work goes into it, so we all regret this outcome but ultimately concluded it was not possible to carry out a celebration in the way we had hoped and planned,” PEN America CEO Suzanne Nossel said in a statement Monday.The cancellation comes as tensions over the war have spread throughout the country, from college campuses to political events to roadways, which at times have been blocked by protesters everywhere from Illinois to California.Since the war began last October, authors affiliated with PEN have repeatedly denounced the organization for allegedly favoring Israel and downplaying atrocities against Palestinian writers and journalists. In an open letter published last month, and endorsed by Naomi Klein and Lorrie Moore among others, the signers criticized PEN for not mobilizing “any substantial coordinated support” for Palestinians and for not upholding its mission to “dispel all hatreds and to champion the ideal of one humanity living in peace and equality in one world.”PEN has responded by citing that it has condemned the loss of life in Gaza, called for a ceasefire and helped set up a $100,000 emergency fund for Palestinian writers. Last week, PEN America President Jennifer Finney Boylan announced that a committee was being formed to review the organization’s work, “not just over the last six months, but indeed, going back a decade, to ensure we are aligned with our mission and make recommendations about how we respond to future conflicts.”Critics have said that the relief fund is too small and noted that PEN waited until March to endorse a ceasefire, five months after the war began.Stein finalists had included Justin Torres’ “Blackouts,” winner last fall of the National Book Award for fiction, and Catherine Lacey’s “Biography of X.” At the request of the estate for Jean Stein, an author and oral historian who died in 2017, the prize money will be donated to the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund.“Jean Stein was a passionate advocate for Palestinian rights who published, supported, and celebrated Palestinian writers and visual artists,” reads a statement from Katrina Vanden Heuvel, Wendy Vanden Heuvel and Bill Clegg, on behalf of the Stein estate. “While she established the PEN America award in her name to bring attention to and provide meaningful support to writers of the highest literary achievement, we know she would have respected the stance and sacrifice of the writers who have withdrawn from contention this year.”Camille T. Dungy’s “Soil” had been the only remaining Stein award contender.PEN announced Monday that judges had selected a handful of winners, among them Javier Fuentes’ “Countries of Origin” for debut novel, the PEN/Hemingway award. Playwright/screenwriter Tony Kushner will still receive the PEN/Mike Nichols Writing for Performance Award. Other honorary awards include the PEN/Nabokov Award for Achievement in International Literature, given to the late Maryse Condé.Some authors have called for the resignation of Nossel and other top officials. Lacey, in an Instagram post last week, wrote that PEN needed to “make big changes in the leadership and move into a new era.” More than a dozen awards finalists endorsed a recent letter that demanded Nossel, Boylan and others step down and alleged that PEN had “shown blatant disregard of our collective values.”A PEN spokesperson said it had no plans to respond to calls for Nossel and others to resign.PEN’s other high-profile spring events — the “World Voices” festivals in New York and Los Angeles, and the gala at the American Museum of Natural History — will go ahead as scheduled. Klein and Moore are among the writers who have said they will not attend the World Voices festival, which Rushdie helped establish 20 years ago. Rushdie and other former PEN presidents, including Jennifer Egan and Andrew Solomon, had recently published a letter urging the literary community to participate in the festival.“The festival was conceived amid conflict to draw together diverse authors and thinkers at a time of deepening and deadly geopolitical tension after 9/11,” the letter reads in part.“We believe in PEN America and the festival and urge that, even at a time of discord, readers and writers will once again find a way to come together to jointly quest for insight and inspiration.”",2024-04-22 22:37:54 PM EEST,NPR,PEN America calls off awards ceremony amid criticism over its response to Israel-Hamas war,https://apnews.com/article/pen-america-awards-ceremony-canceled-israel-palestine-41706ebf7fe1154a12e6de8acd529a30
David Bauder,"NEW YORK (AP) — They watched from the courtroom or via closed-circuit television in an overflow room — roughly 140 reporters, most with laptops or other silenced electronic devices, serving up news at its most elemental and in rapid-fire fashion.There were utterances posted a few seconds after they left a lawyer’s mouth. Observations on how Donald Trump is reacting. Tidbits on what testimony is causing jurors to scribble notes. “Let me give you some quotes to make you feel like you’re inside the courtroom,” MSNBC’s Yasmin Vossoughian said before reading the reports of colleagues.Trump’s hush money trial is illustrating the potency of live blogs as a news tool — by necessity.Television and text journalism are normally two very different mediums. Yet because New York state rules forbid camera coverage of trials and the former president’s case has such high interest, blogs are emerging as the best way to communicate for both formats.During opening arguments in the case on Monday, CNN used one-third of its television screen to display short printed updates of what was going on, written by its three journalists stationed at the Manhattan courthouse. MSNBC did something similar with onscreen “chyrons” — superimposed text.Traditional outlets like The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Associated Press use news blogs regularly, experience that proved helpful Monday. While such blogs often supplement traditional television coverage of big events like the Academy Awards or election nights — it’s known as a “second-screen” experience — this time consumers had no other option.Some 140 reporters watched from the courtroom or via closed-circuit television in an overflow room, feeding news to editors. They’re watched carefully themselves: Two reporters covering the trial were expelled on Monday for breaking rules prohibiting recording and photography in the overflow room, where reporters who can’t get into the courtroom watch the proceedings on large screens, according to court officials.Blog dispatches sometimes felt like bits and pieces of a print story in development, like this from The Washington Post’s Devlin Barrett: “They disguised what the payments were,” (prosecutor Matthew) Colangelo said, speaking clearly and calmly with his hands in his suit pockets.”Others try to set the scene: “All 18 jurors are looking directly at the veteran prosecutor, who stands at a lectern in the middle of the courtroom about halfway between them and Trump,” wrote AP’s Michael R. Sisak.The New York Post ‘s Kyle Schnitzer wrote that Trump attorney Todd Blanche wrapped up his opening statement with a hometown appeal, quoting him in saying, “use your common sense, you’re New Yorkers, that’s why we are here.”Other observances are more analytical or seek to correct the record.The Post’s Shayna Jacobs wrote that “in opening statements, prosecutors focused heavily on the circumstantial evidence that they argue will help prove that Donald Trump paid off Stormy Daniels in 2016 to keep her from going public about an alleged encounter with Trump a decade before.”The Times’ Maggie Haberman wrote as Trump’s attorney was delivering his opening statement that “Blanche is trying to portray the the National Enquirer’s practices as similar to how other news outlets operate, in terms of deciding when and how to publish a story. That is not correct.”For CNN and MSNBC, which covered opening arguments more extensively Monday than Trump-friendly outlets Fox News Channel and Newsmax, there were some growing pains in getting used to the new form of storytelling.MSNBC used text less frequently, occasionally relying on the awkwardness of correspondents trying to search through notes for the latest quotes. “Trump lawyer: Trump is not on the hook for what Cohen did,” read one MSNBC chyron. “Trump lawyer: Nothing wrong with trying to influence an election,” read another.A handful of times, CNN’s Jake Tapper interrupted speakers to read blog dispatches that viewers were also able to see for themselves on their screens.Still, the blog-like reports were often more helpful than on-screen analysts, particularly when they tried to predict what would take place next. One MSNBC pundit confidently predicted that Judge Juan Merchan would end the day’s proceedings before a first witness was called and a CNN analyst said that first witness would wrap his testimony with a juicy revelation.Neither happened.David Bauder writes about media for The Associated Press.

None,"NEW YORK (AP) — The baseball players’ association asked a federal court to confirm an arbitrator’s decision denying an attempt by a baseball agent at Bad Bunny’s Rimas Sports firm to block the agent’s decertification by the union.In a complaint filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the Major League Baseball Players Association asked that a federal judge issue an order to confirm what the union said was a decision by arbitrator Michael Gottesman to deny a request for a temporary restraining order requested by William Arroyo of Rimas Sports and Noah Assad and Jonathan Miranda, two executives of the company.The union said it issued a notice of discipline to the three on April 10 and fined them $400,000 for misconduct. Arroyo was an agent certified by the union to represent players and represented New York Mets catcher Francisco Alvarez and infielder Ronny Mauricio.Assad and Miranda had applied for certification, the union said.“After detailing extensive, serious violations of the MLBPA regulations, including those prohibiting inducements and unlawful recruiters and requiring cooperation with MLBPA investigations, the MLBPA revoked Mr. Arroyo’s certification and denied certification to applicants Messrs. Assad and Miranda,” the union said.The union said it agreed to let Gottesman hear the application by the three for a temporary restraining order. Represented by lawyer Jeffrey Kessler, the union did not appear to file a copy of Gottesman’s decision with its complaint, which was first reported by ESPN.Bad Bunny is one of the top-selling artists in the world whose real name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio.

"Steve Karnowski,Mike Catalini","ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — A movement to ban book bans is gaining steam in Minnesota and several other states, in contrast to the trend playing out in more conservative states where book challenges have soared to their highest levels in decades.The move to quash book bans is welcome to people like Shae Ross, a queer and out Minnesota high school senior who has fought on the local level against bans on books dealing with sexuality, gender and race. Ross, 18, said she is encouraged to see her governor and leaders of other states are taking the fight statewide.“For a lot of teenagers, LGBT teenagers and teenagers who maybe just don’t feel like they have a ton of friends, or a ton of popularity in middle or high school ... literature becomes sort of an escape.” Ross said. “Especially when I was like sixth, seventh grade, I’d say reading books, especially books with gay characters ... was a way that I could feel seen and represented.”Minnesota is one of several Democratic-leaning states where lawmakers are now pursuing bans on book bans. The Washington and Maryland legislatures have already passed them this year, while Illinois did so last year. It was a major flashpoint of Oregon’s short session, where legislation passed the Senate but died without a House vote.According to the American Library Association, over 4,200 works in school and public libraries were targeted in 2023, a jump from the old record of nearly 2,600 books in 2022. Many challenged books — 47% in 2023 — had LGBTQ+ and racial themes.Restrictions in some states have increased so much that librarians and administrators fear crippling lawsuits, hefty fines and even imprisonment if they provide books that others regard as inappropriate. Already this year, lawmakers in more than 15 states have introduced bills to impose harsh penalties on libraries or librarians.Conservative parents and activists argue that the books are too sexually explicit or otherwise controversial, and are inappropriate, especially for younger readers. National groups such as Moms for Liberty say parents are entitled to more control over books available to their children.But pushback is emerging. According to EveryLibrary, a political action committee for libraries, several states are considering varying degrees of prohibitions on book bans. A sampling includes California, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Kansas, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont, though some in conservative states appear unlikely to pass. One has also died in New Mexico this year.One such bill is awaiting Democratic Gov. Wes Moore’s signature in Maryland. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee signed a bill last month that sets a high bar for removing challenged materials, especially those dealing with race, sexual orientation and gender identity. A version pending in New Jersey would protect librarians from civil or criminal liability.Some proposals are labeled “Freedom to Read” acts.“That’s what’s so critical here. The voluntary nature of reading,” said Martha Hickson, a librarian at North Hunterdon High School in New Jersey. “Students can choose to read, not read, or totally ignore everything in this library. No one is asking them to read a damn thing.”Hickson recalled how parents first suggested her book collections contained pedophilia and pornography during a school board meeting in 2021. She watched the livestream in horror as they objected that the novel “Lawn Boy” and illustrated memoir “Gender Queer” were available to students and suggested she could be criminally liable.“Tears welled up, shaking” Hickson said. ”But once my body got done with that, my normal attitude, the fight side kicked in, and I picked up my cellphone while the meeting was still going on and started reaching out.”Book bans have been a sore point for Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a former high school teacher. The Minnesota Senate passed his proposal this month. It would prohibit book bans in public and school libraries based on content or ideological objections and require that the key decisions about what books will or won’t be offered be made by library professionals.The state House is considering an approach with more teeth, including penalties and allowing private citizens to sue to enforce it.“I’m working with stakeholders, with the Department of Education, librarians, school districts and their representatives,” said Democratic Rep. Cedrick Frazier, of New Hope. “We’re working to tighten up the language, to make sure we can come to a consensus, and just kind of make sure that everybody’s on the same page.”Ross, a student at Jefferson High School in Bloomington, was alarmed when she heard last year that conservative groups were organizing in her community to ban books based on their content. So she and her friends got organized themselves, and they helped persuade their school board to make it much harder to remove books and other materials from their libraries and classrooms.Because of her activism, Ross was invited when Walz went to Como Park Senior High School in St. Paul last month to view a display of books banned elsewhere. The governor called book bans “the antithesis of everything we believe” and denounced what he depicted as a growing effort to bully school boards.At a House hearing last month, speakers said books by LGBTQ+ and authors of color are among those most frequently banned. Karlton Laster, director of policy and organizing for OutFront Minnesota, who identifies as Black and queer, said reading their works helped him “communicate my hard feelings and truths to my family and friends,” and helped him come out to his family.Kendra Redmond, a Bloomington mother with three children in public schools, testified about efforts to push back against a petition drive by conservatives to pull about 28 titles from the city’s school libraries.Pushback from Ross, Redmond and others succeeded. The Bloomington School Board last month made it much harder to seek removals. Parents can still restrict access by their own children to material they deem objectionable.Many challenges in the district came from the Bloomington Parents Alliance. One of its leaders, Alan Redding, recalled how his son’s 9th grade class was discussing a book a few years ago when graphic passages about date rape were read aloud in class. He said his son and other kids were unprepared for something so explicit.“They were clearly bothered by this and disgusted,” Redding said. ”My son absolutely shut down for the semester.”Minnesota Republican lawmakers have argued that instead of worrying about book bans, they should be focusing instead on performance in a state where just under half of public school students can read at grade level.“Every book is banned for a child that doesn’t know how to read,” said GOP Rep. Patricia Mueller, a teacher from Austin.Catalini reported from Trenton, New Jersey.

Jill Lawless,"LONDON (AP) — It’s springtime in Europe — time for the annual blossoming of spectacle and sound known as the Eurovision Song Contest.Taking place in May in Malmö, Sweden, the 68th annual competition will see acts from 37 countries vie for the continent’s pop crown in a feelgood extravaganza that strives — not always successfully – to banish international strife and division. And you don’t have to be in Europe to watch, or to help pick the winner.Here’s a guide to all things Eurovision.On one level, it’s simple: Eurovision is an international pop music competition in which acts from countries across Europe, and a few beyond it, compete in a live televised contest to be crowned Eurovision champion.But it’s also much more -- a celebration of diversity, national pride and the joyous power of pop. And glitter. So much glitter.Launched in 1956 to foster unity after World War II, Eurovision has become a campy, feel-good celebration of pop music with an audience of hundreds of millions around the world. It has grown from seven countries to almost 40, including non-European nations such as Israel and Australia.It’s now known for songs that range from anthemic to extremely silly, often with elaborate costumes and spectacular staging.Paul Jordan, an expert on the contest who is known as “Dr. Eurovision,” said the contest “is almost indescribable in terms of its scale, in terms of its craziness — but I would liken it to probably the musical version of the Olympic Games.”This year’s contest will be held in Malmö in southern Sweden, with two semifinals on May 7 and 9 followed by a grand final on May 11. Traditionally the competition is hosted by the previous year’s winner, and Sweden triumphed in 2023 with “Tattoo,” a power ballad by pop diva Loreen.The Nordic nation is a Eurovision powerhouse that has won the contest seven times, a number equaled only by Ireland.This year marks the 50th anniversary of a Eurovision’s most iconic moment, ABBA’s victory in the 1974 contest with “Waterloo.” The win propelled the band toward superstardom and helped jump-start Sweden’s music industry.Fans are hoping for an appearance by the Swedish supergroup in Malmö, though the band members have played down those suggestions.Eurovision’s motto is “united by music” and organizer the European Broadcasting Union strives to keep political divisions out of the competition, though it doesn’t always succeed.Russia has been banned since its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Last year’s contest was held in the English city of Liverpool because the 2022 winner, Ukraine, was at war.This year, pro-Palestinian activists and some musicians have urged organizers to drop Israel from the event over its conduct in its war against Hamas, which has killed more than 33,000 people in Gaza, according to its Health Ministry.Israel has not been suspended, but it was ordered to change the lyrics of its competing song, originally titled “October Rain,” an apparent reference to Hamas’ cross-border Oct. 7 attack that killed some 1,200 Israelis. Renamed “Hurricane,” the power ballad will be performed by 20-year-old singer Eden Golan.With feelings running high, organizers issued a statement saying they “firmly oppose any form of online abuse, hate speech, or harassment directed at our artists or any individuals associated with the contest.”Jordan said Eurovision organizers have sometimes been accused of inconsistency in setting the contest’s boundaries.“You’re not allowed political entries …and yet Finland 2013 has a song about equal marriage,” he said. “You had other songs about world peace -- technically they’re political too. So what is the division between politics and non-politics is quite a blurred line.”Pro-Palestinian groups plan demonstrations in downtown Malmo during Eurovision week that they hope will draw thousands of protesters from Sweden and neighboring countries.Malmö district police chief Petra Stenkula said security would be “rigorous,” with Swedish police reinforced by officers from Denmark and Norway.Eurovision’s complex voting system, which awards points from juries of music industry professionals as well as viewers across Europe, makes winners notoriously hard to predict.Jordan said there used to be a “typical” Eurovision sound -– a three-minute pop song in English with a key change — but the contest is now much more diverse. Many acts perform in their national languages and some draw on folk traditions and instruments, though slick production and electro beats still predominate.Winners have ranged from Canadian chanteuse Celine Dion, who competed for Switzerland in 1988, to fright mask-wearing Finnish metalheads Lordi in 2006, bearded Austrian drag performer Conchita Wurst in 2014, Italian rock band Måneskin in 2021 and Ukrainian folk-rap group Kalush Orchestra in 2022.Bookmakers’ favorites this year include nonbinary Swiss singer Nemo’s powerhouse song “The Code” and Croatian singer-songwriter Baby Lasagna’s earwormy electro number “Rim Tim Tagi Dim.”Other entries to watch include the Netherlands’ Joost Klein with pop-rap song “Europapa,” “La Noia“ by Italian TikTok star Angelina Mango and “Teresa & Maria” by the Ukrainian duo of rapper alyona alyona and vlogger Jerry Heil.Spain’s entry, “ Zorra” by the duo Nebulossa, has drawn controversy because its title can be translated as an anti-female slur.The U.K., which has not won since 1997, is pinning its hopes on Olly Alexander’s vertiginous pop song “Dizzy.” Host country Sweden is represented by identical twins Marcus & Martinus -– who, confusingly enough, hail from Norway -- with the confidently titled “Unforgettable.” Eurovision voters will be the judge of that.The competition will be aired by national broadcasters in participating nations, on streaming service Peacock in the United States and on the Eurovision YouTube channel. Viewers in the U.S. and other nonparticipating countries can vote online or using the Eurovision app; viewers in participating countries can also vote by phone or text message.",2024-04-23 08:37:32 AM EEST,NPR,"From pop to politics, what to know as Sweden prepares for the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest",https://apnews.com/article/eurovision-2024-song-contest-sweden-2a6a9a789415f04ae997a688274e4e6f
Darlene Superville,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Actor Ashley Judd and singer-songwriter Aloe Blacc, who both lost loved ones to suicide, on Tuesday helped the Biden administration promote its new national strategy to prevent suicide.Judd’s mother, country star Naomi Judd, died nearly two years ago. Blacc’s frequent collaborator, Tim Bergling, died in 2018.Both were on hand as Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, helped unveil the Democratic administration’s blueprint for reducing suicides in the United States. Some 132 people a day kill themselves, he said.“We’re here today because we know that we can and will change this,” Emhoff said. “Suicide is preventable.”———EDITOR’S NOTE — This story includes discussion of suicide.

Andrew Dalton,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — A photographer who worked for Megan Thee Stallion said in a lawsuit filed Tuesday that he was forced to watch her have sex, was unfairly fired soon after and was abused as her employee.In the suit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, Emilio Garcia said that after a night out in 2022 in Ibiza, Spain, he was in an SUV with the hip-hop star when she began having sex with another woman right next to him. He was unable to get out of the moving car, and would have been in the middle of nowhere in a foreign country even if he was able. Garcia was “embarrassed, mortified and offended throughout the whole ordeal,” according to the lawsuit.Alex Spiro, Megan’s lawyer, said she would fight the lawsuit in court.“This is an employment claim for money — with no sexual harassment claim filed and with salacious accusations to attempt to embarrass her,” Spiro said.The next day Megan told Garcia never to discuss what he saw and berated and fat-shamed him, the lawsuit said. The complaint also said Garcia, who had already considered quitting because he was overworked and underpaid in a hostile work environment aggravated by Megan’s possessiveness and abusiveness, was misclassified as an independent contractor but treated as an exclusive employee.Garcia raised those issues in the conversation with Megan, and was fired the following day after four years of working for her, the suit said. He has since filed a job discrimination complaint with the California Civil Rights Department.The lawsuit, first reported by NBC News, names as defendants Megan, whose legal name is Megan Pete; her companies Megan Thee Stallion Entertainment and Hot Girl Touring; and her label, Roc Nation. A defense response has yet to be filed. There was no immediate response to an email seeking comment from a representative of Roc Nation.Garcia is seeking financial damages to be determined at trial, alleging he has suffered severely both emotionally and physically because of his treatment on the job, the firing and having to witness the scene in the SUV.Megan, 29, was previously involved in major legal drama — and underwent a torrent of online abuse — as the victim of a shooting by rapper Tory Lanez, who a jury found fired at her feet on a street in the Hollywood Hills in 2020. She testified at the trial where jurors convicted Lanez of three felonies and a judge sentenced him to 10 years in prison.Already a major rising artist at the time of the shooting, Megan has since become one of hip-hop’s biggest stars. She won a Grammy for best new artist in 2021, and she had No. 1 singles with “Savage,” featuring Beyoncé, and as a guest on Cardi B’s “WAP.”",2024-04-24 03:21:27 AM EEST,NPR,Photographer alleges he was forced to watch Megan Thee Stallion have sex and was unfairly fired,https://apnews.com/article/megan-thee-stallion-photographer-lawsuit-56fa11e5c1e7423086fd2f0660d1b391
Ken Ritter,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — The defense attorney representing a former Los Angeles-area gang leader accused of killing hip-hop music icon Tupac Shakur in 1996 in Las Vegas said Tuesday his client’s accounts of the killing are fiction and prosecutors lack key evidence to obtain a murder conviction.“He himself is giving different stories,” attorney Carl Arnold told reporters outside a courtroom following a brief status check with his client, Duane “Keffe D” Davis, in front of a Nevada judge. His trial is scheduled for Nov. 4.“We haven’t seen more than just his word,” Arnold said of Davis’ police and media interviews since 2008 in which prosecutors say he incriminated himself in Shakur’s killing — including Davis’ 2019 tell-all memoir of life leading a street gang in Compton, California.Prosecutor Binu Palal did not immediately comment outside court about Arnold’s statements. Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson has said evidence against Davis is strong and it will be up to a jury to decide the credibility of Davis’ accounts.Arnold said his client wanted to make money with his story, so he embellished or outright lied about his involvement in the car-to-car shooting that killed Shakur and wounded rap music mogul Marion “Suge” Knight at a traffic signal near the Las Vegas Strip in September 1996.Knight, now 59, is serving 28 years in a California prison for killing a Compton businessman with a vehicle in 2015. He was not called by prosecutors to testify before the grand jury that indicted Davis last year.Arnold said Davis will not testify at trial, but he intends to call Knight to testify. The defense attorney said police and prosecutors lack proof that Davis was in Las Vegas at the time of Shakur’s killing, and don’t have the gun and car used during the shooting as evidence.“We’ve seen video of everybody else here. Where’s video of him?” Arnold said of Davis. “There’s just nothing saying that he was here.”Davis has been jailed on $750,000 bail since his arrest in September. Arnold said Tuesday that Davis has been unable to raise the 10% needed to obtain a bond to be released to house arrest.Davis, 60, is originally from Compton. Police, prosecutors and Davis say he is the only person still alive  who was in the car from which shots were fired.Davis pleaded not guilty in November to first-degree murder. If convicted, he could spend the rest of his life in prison.In his book, Davis wrote that he was promised immunity from prosecution when he told authorities in Los Angeles what he knew about the fatal shootings of Shakur and rival rapper Christopher Wallace six months later in Los Angeles. Wallace was known as The Notorious B.I.G. or Biggie Smalls.Shakur had five No. 1 albums, was nominated for six Grammy Awards and was inducted in 2017 into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. He received a posthumous star last year on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.This story has been updated to correct that Marion “Suge” Knight is in prison for killing someone with a vehicle, not a fatal shooting.",2024-04-24 00:03:49 AM EEST,NPR,"Ex-gang leader’s account of Tupac Shakur killing is fiction, defense lawyer in Vegas says",https://apnews.com/article/tupac-shakur-killing-vegas-keffe-davis-ae7523c6a926eb7285b9bb7820a69339
Scott Bauer,"The venerable Neil Young offers a ragged and raw live take of his beloved 1990 album “Ragged Glory” with a new album, titled “Fu##in’ Up.”Of course, the 2024 version doesn’t have the same semi-youthful energy that the 44-year-old Young put into the original. Maybe his voice is a little shakier, the guitar solos not quite as refined, but the songs still crackle with a power that’s frankly stunning coming from the not-so-young Young.It’s clear that the 78-year-old and his band Crazy Horse fed off the small crowd at the Toronto club where this was recorded in November 2023. Young is obviously having a blast on stage, so much so that he decided to release the songs just months after the performance. This is from a guy who has held on to some of his most beloved live shows for half a century.Young and Crazy Horse perform nine of the 10 “Ragged Glory” songs in nearly identical arrangements to how they were recorded back in 1990.Only one song from the original release, “Mother Earth (Natural Anthem),” is absent on ”Fu##in’ Up.” The songs have all been retitled with lyrics from the original, except for the cover of “Farmer John.”For example, “Over and Over” becomes “Broken Circle” and “Love to Burn” becomes “Valley of Hearts.”The somewhat profane album title is more or less the same as a song from “Ragged Glory,” just with a couple of different characters in between the “f” and the “in.” (It went from “F(asterisk)!#in’ Up” in 1990 to “Fu##kin’ Up” in 2024.)For all of its virtues, some fans of the original may quibble with Young tackling the material 34 years later, especially since he doesn’t differ much from the originals.“Not everyone will want to hear it because it’s not for everyone,” Young writes in the liner notes. “In the spirit it’s offered, we made this for the Horse lovers. I can’t stop it. The Horse is runnin’ — what a ride we have. I don’t want to mess with the vibe, and I am so happy to have this to share.”It may be for a niche Neil audience, but that niche is sure to love it. And Young probably doesn’t care what the rest think.",2024-04-22 19:18:41 PM EEST,NPR,"Music Review: Neil Young delivers appropriately ragged, raw live version of 1990’s ‘Ragged Glory’",https://apnews.com/article/neil-young-album-review-b579a2eabcd4d873533a07426e4b07ef
Laura Ungar,"With syphilis cases in U.S. newborns skyrocketing, a doctors group now recommends that all pregnant patients be screened three times for the sexually transmitted infection.The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued new guidance on Thursday saying the screening should be done at the first prenatal visit, during the third trimester and at birth. Though the screening isn’t required, health professionals generally follow the group’s recommendations.“The cases of congenital syphilis are definitely climbing, and they’ve been climbing over the last 10 years. And it’s completely preventable ... It’s unacceptable,” said Dr. Laura Riley, who chairs the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Weill Cornell Medicine and helped with the guidance. “We need to be able to do better diagnostics and treatment.”Previously, the group recommended one test in the third trimester — but only for women considered at risk of getting syphilis during pregnancy or those living in communities with high rates of the disease. But this risk-based approach is “how we get into trouble because we’re missing cases,” Riley said.Earlier this year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said more than 3,700 babies were born with congenital syphilis in 2022, the most in more than 30 years. U.S. health officials called for stepping up prevention, including screening which is done with a blood test.In its advisory, the OB-GYN group said CDC statistics show nearly 9 in 10 congenital syphilis cases that year “could have been prevented with timely screening and treatment.”Infections during pregnancy are generally treated with at least two doses of penicillin. Babies born to women with untreated syphilis may be stillborn or die shortly after birth. The disease can also cause other problems in newborns, such as deformed bones, severe anemia, blindness or deafness.“I hope that everyone takes it seriously,” Riley said. Kids with congenital syphilis may have birth defects that can be devastating — “which is incredibly sad.”The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Andrew Dalton,"Several crew members were injured and two were hospitalized when a car and truck collided during shooting of the Eddie Murphy film “The Pickup” from Amazon MGM Studios, the studio and a person close to the production said Tuesday.A studio spokesperson said in a statement to The Associated Press that the scene that led to Saturday’s accident in Georgia had been rehearsed and all safety precautions were taken.Neither Murphy nor the film’s other stars, including Keke Palmer and Pete Davidson, were on the set at the time.The injuries ranged from bumps and bruises to broken bones, the person close to the production said. Two crew members were taken to the hospital, and one remained hospitalized Tuesday. All are expected to make a full recovery.The accident happened on a location outside of Atlanta when a truck locked up and hit a car, the person said.The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly.“It was a completely freak accident,” the person said. “It wasn’t even a complicated or dangerous stunt.”The scene was being shot by a second unit on the production, which generally shoots less-central scenes not involving the director or principal actors.“Unfortunately, the sequence did not go as planned and several members of the crew were injured as a result. We are still in the process of gathering facts on what happened and why, but first and foremost our thoughts are with those who are recovering,” a statement to the AP from the studio spokesperson said. “The well-being of the entire crew and cast is our first priority, and we will continue to insist on the highest industry standards of safety while filming. All safety precautions were reviewed prior to and monitored during the shoot.”The studio did not give details on the injuries or the roles of the crew members who were hurt.The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, the union representing most film crew members, said in a statement to the AP that they were aware of the accident and have begun an inquiry, but could not yet provide further details.The film is directed by Tim Story, whose credits include 2002’s “Barbershop” and 2005’s “Fantastic Four.” It has been shooting in an around Atlanta since Feb. 20.

None,"ROME (AP) — Italy’s Culture Ministry has banned loans of works to the Minneapolis Institute of Art, following a dispute with the U.S. museum over an ancient marble statue believed to have been looted from Italy almost a half-century ago.The dispute began in March 2022 when an Italian court ruled that the Minneapolis museum was irregularly in possession of the Stabiae Doriforo, a Roman-era copy of The Doryphoros of Polykleitos, an ancient Greek sculpture.Rome claims that the sculpture was looted in the 1970s from an archaeological site at Stabiae, an ancient city close to Pompeii that was also covered by lava and ashes when Mount Vesuvius erupted in A.D. 79.A spokesman for Italy’s Culture Ministry confirmed the ban on Wednesday.In February 2022, Italian prosecutors issued an international warrant for the artwork to be impounded and returned. At a news conference earlier this year, Nunzio Fragliasso, chief prosecutor at the Torre Annunziata court, said they were “still awaiting a response.”In 1984, while the work was on display in a German museum, Italy initiated a legal proceeding to claim it. The claim was denied in 1986. The U.S. museum, which bought the statue in 1986 for $2.5 million, said it was purchased from art dealer Elie Borowski and imported into the United States.“Since that time, the work has been publicly displayed and extensively published,” the Minneapolis museum said in a statement. “While it takes issue with recent press reports regarding the Doryphoros, Mia (the museum) believes that the media is not an appropriate forum to address unproven allegations.”The museum asserted that it has always acted “responsibly and proactively” with respect to claims related to its collection. However, it added, ”where proof has not been provided, as well as where Mia has evidence reasonably demonstrating that a claim is not supported, Mia has declined to transfer the work.”The museum called Italy’s new ban on loans “contrary to decades of exchanges between museums.”",2024-04-24 20:51:18 PM EEST,NPR,Italy bans loans of works to the Minneapolis Institute of Art in a dispute over an ancient statue,https://apnews.com/article/italy-minneapolis-institute-of-art-dispute-statue-c697454bf793e973388427d2524bde87
Mike Silverman,"NEW YORK (AP) — Asmik Grigorian laughs when she recalls that she had been singing professionally for more than a decade when the International Opera Awards proclaimed her the “best young female singer” of 2016.“So for 12 years I was nothing, and then I immediately became the best!” the Lithuanian soprano joked in an interview.Now at the peak of her career and seemingly able to sing just about any role she chooses, from Dvorak’s lyrical “Rusalka” to Puccini’s dramatic “Turandot,” Grigorian is about to make her Metropolitan Opera debut in another Puccini classic, “Madame Butterfly.”“My only regret is not having booked her sooner,” said Met general manager Peter Gelb. “Asmik is an operatic force of nature, one of the greatest and most complete vocal and acting packages in recent operatic history.”Growing up in Vilnius she had plenty of exposure to opera. Both her parents, tenor Gegam Grigorian and soprano Irena Milkeviciute, were opera singers and both appeared at the Met, where Asmik traveled with them while a young girl.When she launched her own career, she took pains not to trade on the family fame.“I was pretty successful in that,” Grigorian said, “because even now many people say, ‘Oh you have the same name, you know he was a great tenor,’ and I say ‘Yeah, I know, he was my father.’”It took her many years from her 2004 debut in Norway at age 23 as Donna Anna in Mozart’s “Don Giovanni” to achieve the combination of dramatic intensity and seamless vocalism that have opera houses around the world competing for her talents.“In the beginning I always had a reputation as a pure stage animal who is not really 100% able to control my voice,” she said. “It was true.“I was too young,” she added. “Control demands experience, so of course I failed a thousand, million times and this is an amazing thing to do. I think it’s the biggest sadness of the generation now because we are so visible and people are not allowing themselves to fail anymore, and how can you develop without failing?”Eventually the lack of a dependable vocal technique caught up with her. “You come to the age where you can’t just rely on nature,” she said. “I hurt my voice, I hurt my body, I hurt everything.”By 2012, she said, “I could not sing anything any more. And I decided, OK I have two choices: I can continue killing myself, or I start from the beginning.”Grigorian worked hard for years to build her technique and knew she had succeeded when a critic said “she is perfect technically, and it’s so boring because she is not so interesting as an actress.”“Then I thought, now I did it!” Grigorian, 42, said. “But when you are so focused on technique it’s a bit too cold.” Finding she could trust her voice allowed her to flourish again as a performer “and a different type of magic” started to happen.Triumph after triumph followed. Of her 2018 Salzburg role debut as Salome in the Richard Strauss opera, Financial Times critic Shirley Apthorp raved that “hers is a Salome to end all Salomes … Grigorian’s charisma sweeps it all in her wake.”Three years later when she made her debut at the Wagner shrine in Bayreuth, Germany, as Senta in “The Flying Dutchman,” Joshua Barone in The New York Times called her performance “luxuriously lyrical” and noted she was “met with a roaring ovation.”Acclaim also greeted her last year when she took on two parts many thought would be too taxing for her voice: Verdi’s Lady Macbeth in Salzburg and Turandot in Vienna.Her fellow singers seem as enthusiastic about her as critics and audiences.“She is the best partner I’ve ever had on stage. End of discussion,” said tenor Joshua Guerrero, who recently sang opposite her in “Madame Butterfly” at London’s Royal Opera House. He cited in particular “her willingness to remove ego and to put the other person forward when they are singing their part.”As Butterfly, Guerrero said she brought to the role “a beautiful stillness … She played it very naively, with a childlike approach.”Grigorian explains: “I like to hear a lyrical sound with very tender colors because she’s a 15-year-old girl.“But at the same time, it’s pretty challenging,” she said, because a singer with too light a voice will struggle to be heard over Puccini’s thick orchestral textures.To avoid a steady diet of heavier roles, Grigorian is diligent about mixing up her repertoire.“I definitely don’t consider myself a dramatic soprano or a Wagnerian soprano,” she said. “If I sing something dramatic, I put something lyrical in the middle so I keep my flexibility.”That’s why it comes as only a mild surprise to hear that — despite misgivings — one of her new roles for next season in Vienna is the Druid princess heroine of Bellini’s “Norma,” a part that demands the utmost dexterity with its long lyrical lines and rapid ornamentation.“I have no clue. I never did any bel canto,” she said. “I’m very nervous and probably I will be the worst Norma on the planet. But I do that because I need to keep my voice flexible. I want to learn many new things.”Grigorian is at the Met this season for five performances starting Friday, with the last one on May 11 to be shown live in movie theaters. But she’ll be back in future seasons to sing “Salome,” Janacek’s “Jenufa” — and no doubt more.",2024-04-23 20:24:30 PM EEST,NPR,Lithuanian soprano Asmik Grigorian makes belated Metropolitan Opera debut as Madame Butterfly,https://apnews.com/article/asmik-grigorian-opera-interview-9fe066c8691fda31e243ccad3a362ddd
Jamie Stengle,"DALLAS (AP) — The first model of the USS Enterprise — used in the opening credits of the original “Star Trek” television series — has boldly gone back home, returning to creator Gene Roddenberry’s son decades after it went missing.The model’s disappearance sometime in the 1970s had become the subject of lore, so it caused a stir when it popped up on eBay last fall. The sellers quickly took it down, and then contacted Dallas-based Heritage Auctions to authenticate it. Last weekend, the auction house facilitated the model’s return.Eugene “Rod” Roddenberry, CEO of Roddenberry Entertainment, said he’s thrilled to have the model that had graced the desk of his father, who died in 1991 at age 70.“This is not going home to adorn my shelves,” Roddenberry said. “This is going to get restored and we’re working on ways to get it out so the public can see it and my hope is that it will land in a museum somewhere.”Heritage’s executive vice president, Joe Maddalena, said the auction house was contacted by people who said they’d discovered it a storage unit, and when it was brought into their Beverly Hills office, he and a colleague “instantly knew that it was the real thing.”They reached out to Roddenberry, who said he appreciates that everyone involved agreed returning the model was the right thing to do. He wouldn’t go into details on the agreement reached but said “I felt it important to reward that and show appreciation for that.”Maddalena said the model vanished in the 1970s after Gene Roddenberry loaned it to makers of “Star Trek: The Motion Picture,” which was released in 1979.“No one knew what happened to it,” Rod Roddenberry said.The 3-foot (0.91-meter) model of the USS Enterprise was used in the show’s original pilot episode as well as the opening credits of the resulting TV series, and was the prototype for the 11-foot (3-meter) version featured in the series’ episodes. The larger model is on display at the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum.The original “Star Trek” television series, which aired in the late 1960s, kicked off an ever-expanding multiverse of cultural phenomena, with TV and movie spinoffs and conventions where a fanbase of zealous and devoted Trekkies can’t get enough of memorabilia.This USS Enterprise model would easily sell for more than $1 million at auction, but really “it’s priceless,” Maddalena said.“It could sell for any amount and I wouldn’t be surprised because of what it is,” he said. “It is truly a cultural icon.”Roddenberry, who was just a young boy when the model went missing, said he has spotty memories of it, “almost a deja vu.” He said it wasn’t something he’d thought much about until people began contacting him after it appeared on eBay.“I don’t think I really, fully comprehended at first that this was the first Enterprise ever created,” he said.He said he has no idea if there was something nefarious behind the disappearance all those decades ago or if it was just mistakenly lost, but it would be interesting to find out more about what happened.“This piece is incredibly important and it has its own story and this would be a great piece of the story,” Roddenberry said.Thankfully, he said, the discovery has cleared up one rumor: That it was destroyed because as a young boy, he’d thrown it into a pool.“Finally I’m vindicated after all these years,” he said with a laugh.",2024-04-18 20:09:11 PM EEST,NPR,Long-lost first model of the USS Enterprise from ‘Star Trek’ boldly goes home after twisting voyage,https://apnews.com/article/star-trek-uss-enterprise-roddenberry-e3cea04b05ae5c24130d144a0b38d051
Cheyanne Mumphrey,"PHOENIX (AP) — A small blue dog with an Australian accent has captured the hearts of people across the world.She’s the title character of “Bluey,” a kids’ program consisting of seven-minute episodes that have enraptured children and adults alike. This week’s release of its longest episode yet — at a whopping 28 minutes — prompted an outpouring of appreciation for the show, even from those who are neither toddler nor parent.“Bluey” follows an Australian blue heeler who, along with her sister (a red heeler named Bingo), navigates the days between home and school. It’s a favorite among children for its playful humor, but it also appeals to adults reminiscing about childhood.“My childhood experience wasn’t the greatest so I’ve always resonated with shows where life is good,” says Miriam Neel, who lives in Colorado. “The parents in ‘Bluey’ enable imagination and creativity and really get involved with their kids, and I wish I had those experiences.”Neel is 32 and has chosen not to have any children of her own. She says the show has become part of her morning routine and is often a go-to choice for background noise when she is working from home.“I’m not going to speak for the entire generation, but millennials find comfort in cartoons. It’s what a lot of us grew up watching,” she said. “And if I’m going to spend time watching something I’d rather watch something that doesn’t make me afraid of the world, like any of the ‘Law & Order’ shows.”“Bluey,” which now boasts more than 150 episodes, premiered in Australia in 2018 and began streaming on Disney+ in 2020. It also has been adapted into a digital series where famous fans like Bindi Irwin and Eva Mendes read some of the popular storybooks, and a live theater show that travels around the world.The show has also won multiple awards, including the Australian Film Institute Award for best children’s television drama every year since 2019 and an International Emmy Kids Award.The series provides a child’s perspective into morning routines, errands and chores, while also giving viewers a glimpse of what life is like for parents through mother Chilli and father Bandit.This week’s special episode, “The Sign,” explores the emotions surrounding themes that resonate with both children and adults — moving houses, marriage, infertility and relationships after divorce. In addition to these universal themes, the episode wraps up the third season with Easter eggs for dedicated fans.Lindsey Schmidt, 40, says the show’s continuity keeps her family looking forward to more.“There are so many callbacks to previous episodes,” says Schmidt, who lives in Ohio with her husband and three children. “The shows that we watch with our kids regularly don’t reflect our lives like this show does. These anthropomorphic dogs feel just like us.”But there are mixed feelings about the ending of the episode — SPOILER — in which the Heeler family scraps their move. Some families who relocate often for work found it unrealistic. Meg Korzon, 31, is in the process of a cross-country relocation with her four children because her husband is in the military. It’s her seventh move in 10 years.“I was hoping it would be an episode that aligned itself with the realities of life, our lives, as a military family,” she says. “I was selfishly disappointed because it could have been an episode about change and growth.”But the show does not shy away from other difficult topics — and that is part of the charm for adults as well.“As a parent you aspire to be as good of parents as Chilli and Bandit are as parents. They always have a great way of talking kids through issues,” Schmidt’s 40-year-old husband John says, adding that the couple often refers back to episodes when trying to explain things to their children.The series has touched on topics of aging, death and making friends as an adult. It also has introduced a character who uses sign language and another with ADHD.Jacqueline Nesi, an assistant professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University, notes that “Bluey” promotes self-regulation and conflict resolution for children and engaged parenting and patience for adults.“We see them working through some of the challenges that we, as parents, might be facing, too. And at the same time, they offer a nice model for different parenting skills — asking open-ended questions to facilitate kids’ creativity, using natural consequences when they misbehave, actively playing with them and letting them take the lead,” she says.The show has also done a lot to expose children to the world of animation, flaunting different styles in the episodes “Escape” and “Dragon,” providing a near-voiceless episode in “Rain,” and breaching the fourth wall in “Puppets,” where the show stops briefly to zoom out on the creation of just a couple seconds of animated frames.It’s also credited with appealing to dogs — and not because the characters are the same species.Research has said dogs have vision similar to red-green color blindness in humans, meaning their color spectrum is limited to blue, yellow, brown and shades of gray — which happen to be the colors of the Heeler family. There were more pets named Bluey, Bingo, Chilli and Bandit across the U.S. last year, too, according to Rover.So it’s fairly safe to say “Bluey” has appeal across species, as well as generations.“I used to tell people what do ‘The Sopranos,’ ‘The Wire’ and ‘Breaking Bad’ have in common? They all have lower IMDb scores than Bluey. It used to anyway. I watched all these great shows, but I think ‘Bluey’ is still a favorite, maybe because I have kids. But I put it right up there with all of them,” John Schmidt says, admitting that he and his wife have watched the episodes without their children.Schmidt says the episode tied a nice bow to end the season, and would be a perfect series finale otherwise.“I get emotional about the potential of Bluey no longer having new episodes,” says Schmidt. “But we’ll see.”",2024-04-19 20:58:19 PM EEST,NPR,"Not a toddler, not a parent, but still love ‘Bluey’?

Josh Cornfield,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Adele, Mariah Carey and Garth Brooks tower over the Las Vegas Strip, peering out from billboards advertising their various casino residencies. But the 20,000 fans marching toward the glowing Sphere last week were there for a band that many Strip visitors have no idea exists.Over the past 40 years, legions of dedicated Phish fans have followed the Vermont jam band no matter where it goes. This time, it happened to be Las Vegas, for four nights at the $2.3 billion immersive arena. No two Phish shows are the same, and while the band had played Vegas 26 times before, the Sphere offered a game-changing canvas for its signature light shows.The fans came in sequined, glittery dresses and tie-dye alike, in button-down shirts and overalls printed with the band’s red doughnut logo. Once inside, they were greeted with a LED screen the size of a football field.Over 68 songs over the four nights, co-creative director Abigail Rosen Holmes would use that expanse to drive fans across bold visual worlds inspired by the four states of matter: solid, liquid, gas and plasma. As Phish jammed, the Sphere’s screens became an art show, taking the audience through flowing streams of color and simple dots of light, around an enchanted lake and a field of psychedelic trees, and through a car wash (yes, a car wash).“It gives me hope,” said Sean Marmora, 31, who traveled from New Jersey. “It’s inspiring that they’re pushing boundaries and doing things that they have never done before.”Some displays were more abstract — during “Sand” and “Chalkdust Torture,” specks of light danced on screen in time to the music — while others were easier to discern: “Bathtub Gin” featured computer-generated people on floats made of donuts, pineapples and pizza slices in a wave pool. During “Maze,” a narrow line of video blew up into bits across the screen. For “Leaves,” hundreds of digital balloons joined the very real balloons flying up inside the Sphere.“It was a very different Phish show, so special in its own right,” said Tim Urbashich, 38, from Wisconsin. “This is a whole evolutionary experience in what’s happening. They deserve visual representation of their music.”Phish’s light shows are typically driven by Chris Kuroda, whom fans have nicknamed CK5 — as in, the fifth member of the band.Kuroda was still heavily involved in the shows at the Sphere, albeit with a stripped-down light setup offsetting the screen. Phish frontman Trey Anastasio said Kuroda played a key role in fighting against the “tyranny of the wall” of visuals.On Saturday night, the screen lit a digital version of the band ablaze during “Fuego,” eventually subsiding into a calm blue. As the real band jumped into “Golden Age,” Kuroda lit them in his signature soft purple and yellow spotlights.Holmes says the production team learned to be looser over the course of the Vegas run, refining and adopting subtle changes to make the visuals more responsive to the music.“This is such a new and different environment, where we started trying to make everything perfect. And then being more comfortable, taking chances and pushing things a bit further,” Holmes said. “I think Chris Kuroda and I were able to reach further and mesh better as the nights went on.”As much as the Sphere shows will be remembered for the visuals, though, it’s the music that ultimately makes Phish.No song was repeated, and the band took advantage of the ability to isolate sounds across the room’s 167,000 speaker drivers. Anastasio says he was proud the band could still go in without a plan. Most large visual concert experiences include a click track to know when to hit certain marks. Phish insisted on being able to improvise.“I felt like if we didn’t have that element, it wouldn’t be a Phish concert,” Anastasio said.At the end of Sunday night’s show, Anastasio vowed to return to the Sphere. Phish was only the second band to play it after U2 opened it with a 40-show run. Dead and Company are scheduled to play there this summer.Meanwhile, Phish will release its 16th studio album, “Evolve,” in July, when it will also launch a summer tour.“As long as the four of us are together and walking this planet, I would like to think that Phish exists and that we can keep playing,” McConnell said of the band’s stamina and longevity.So much of the band’s time together is spent thinking about processes and new approaches, he said.“So we don’t exactly know where it goes and where it’s going. But I have a good feeling that it’s going to go on for a long time,” he said. “I really hope it does.”As long as Phish keeps going, so too will its community. Both Marmora and Urbashich were among the dozens of artists selling their Phish-inspired work at the PhanArt show that pops up at the band’s stops.“We’re all trying here to find something special,” Urbashich said. “You have to open up your mind to the simplest things. It’s so out there and abstract. If you don’t give it patience you might not think it’s what you’re looking for.”",2024-04-24 02:05:38 AM EEST,NPR,Phish fans are famously dedicated.

Jim Pollock,"St. Vincent is on fire.On her seventh full-length studio album, Annie Clark, who performs as St. Vincent, unleashes her broad range of art-rock gifts, from the crackling ember of her textured vocals to the raging infernos of swirling, epic orchestration.St. Vincent canonized her name in the 2010s with twitchy, dense compositions. On the 2021 release, “Daddy’s Home,” her last album, she embraced a looser, 1970s-infused sleaze funk. “All Born Screaming” continues a trend toward more accessible territory, seamlessly spinning elements of acid-jazz, industrial grind, retro-futurism and heavy distortion into apocalyptic walls of sound.The St. Vincent persona is a restless shape shifter, and the album art of this iteration — tailored shirt, pencil skirt, the artist alone and in flames — is an apt representation. “All Born Screaming” is Clark’s first self-produced release, and she is the primary songwriter and musician throughout, playing multiple instruments on every track. The album includes excellent and meticulously placed contributions from musicians including Justin Meldal-Johnsen, Rachel Eckroth, Cian Riordan, David Ralicke, Cate Le Bon, and Dave Grohl. But this is Annie Clark’s show, and, as in the cover image, she is buttoned up and executing a delicate dance between complete control and self-immolation.The first few tracks set the stage. Opener “Hell is Near” hits like Enya with an ethereal delivery of the lines, “Empty cup and a can full of marigolds / half burned candle a picture pinned on the wall,” before shifting gears into a cool groove and building to a huge, spacy outro. “Reckless” follows, starting intimate and quickly upping the stakes. She sings, “Stranger come in my path / I’ll eat you up tear you limb from limb or I’ll fall in love” as the song works toward its explosive crescendo.“Broken Man” continues to raise the temperature. The song features three drummers, including Dave Grohl, and it opens with bonks and clanks reminiscent of Nine Inch Nails’ “Closer,” and the provocative lyrics, “on the street I’m a king-size killer / I can make your kingdom come.” Clark’s vocal command on this song is terrific, starting sultry and steadily gaining strength and intensity as the industrial-rock cacophony builds.The album is generally heavy, but it offers a campy breather with “Violent Times.” Here she channels the classic John Barry theme composition for the 1964 James Bond film “Goldfinger.” The song also a lovely lyrical sketch, with Clark singing “Ashes of Pompeii / lovers discovered in an embrace for all eternity.”“The Power’s Out” starts with a programmed drum break evocative of David Bowie ’s apocalyptic classic, “Five Years.” The lyrics and waltz construction consciously echo its inspiration, with slice-of-life vignettes as people come to grips with impending catastrophe. “It was pouring like a movie,” Clark sings. “Every stranger looked like they knew me.” It is an oddball track within this collection, but it stands as a fascinating Rashomon-like alternate perspective on Bowie’s storytelling.The album ends with the title track. It starts uncharacteristically upbeat, with a guitar sound falling somewhere between Paul Simon and The Smiths’ Johnny Marr. It changes gears midway, building to a climactic chant of the title words, “All Born Screaming” over spacey synth, as if Gregorian monks infiltrated a laser show.It is a fitting end, returning the listener back to the mysterious terror with which we all enter this world.",2024-04-24 21:21:10 PM EEST,NPR,"Music Review: St. Vincent’s art-rock burns bright on seventh album, ‘All Born Screaming’",https://apnews.com/article/st-vincent-all-born-screaming-music-review-90d4a368bfab9f66d0da24a68b5c27a1
Alicia Rancilio,"PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — When Jon Bon Jovi agreed to let director Gotham Chopra follow him with a documentary camera to delve into the history of his band, Bon Jovi, he didn’t anticipate it would catch him at a major low point in his career.The band was launching a tour, and despite doing all he could do to be vocally ready, the “Livin’ on a Prayer” singer struggled through songs and couldn’t hit the notes the way he used to.Critics noticed and wrote about it. A review from Pioneer Press in St. Paul, Minnesota, said: “It felt like he had forgotten how to sing.”In a recent interview with The Associated Press, Bon Jovi said the reaction at the time was “heartbreaking.” After exhausting holistic options, he saw a doctor who said one of his vocal cords was atrophying.“This was unique. It wasn’t a nodule. The strong (vocal cord) was pushing the weak one around, and suddenly, my inabilities were just exacerbated,” said Bon Jovi. He underwent major surgery and is still recovering.“Every day is sort of like doing curls with weights and just getting them both to be the same size and to function together.”This year has been a turning point. In February, he performed for an audience for the first time since his surgery at the MusiCares Person of the Year benefit gala where he was also named Person of The Year. The band’s next album, “Forever” hits stores June 7, and its first single “Legendary” is out now. The four-part, “Thank You, Goodnight: The Bon Jovi Story,” debuts Friday on Hulu.In a Q&A, Bon Jovi talks about his voice, his famous hair, the music industry and his work ethic.Answers have been edited for clarity and brevity.BON JOVI: I’m doing great. The record was easy to do. The process has been steady. Would I like it to be a light switch? Yeah. I said to the doctor, ‘I want to flip the switch and be done with this.’ It’s just not how it works. Like an athlete coming back from an ACL tear or whatever, it just takes time. The therapy is still intensive and yet I’m confident that it gets progressively better.BON JOVI: Not in as much where he sat down and said, ‘I’ve got this idea.’ Really, I was a byproduct of what was the 80s. Those were my baby pictures. I love laughing at them. Now, I can jokingly at least say, ‘After 40 years of a career, I still have all my hair.’ That is a good thing. Genetics works in my favor.BON JOVI: I do, on occasion. My day job then comes back to get in the way. In truth, I’ve got a big record coming out, and I’m hoping to go out on the road, so I don’t have time for it. And I respect the craft far too much to think I’m going to walk on a set and hit my marks and call that acting.BON JOVI: If you’re not going to be great, the guy that’s coming in tomorrow night is going to be better. This isn’t a career that you should take lightly. There’s a million other young guys that are waiting to take your spot. And there are no guarantees in this business...You have to win hearts in order to win people’s hard-earned dollar. If you’re asking them to stay with you for four decades, that’s a task. You better be one of the greats or else good luck.BON JOVI: We never had a big falling out. He quit 10 years ago. It’s not that we’re not in contact or anything like that, but he was choosing to, as a single dad, raise his child. The door is always open if he wants to come up and sing a song. I mean, there’s many of them that we co-wrote together. That’s a great part of both of our lives. There’s no animosity here.BON JOVI: For some, it makes sense because they need to. For some, it makes sense because they want to. I just find (Bon Jovi’s music) to be my baby, and I have no desire at this juncture in my life to ever even consider it.BON JOVI: Part-time! My license is still New Jersey. I still vote in New Jersey.BON JOVI: See, I’m the opposite. I can only put out an album. I do all I know how to do. I have to tell the complete story. It has to be the beginning, a middle and an end because that’s who and what we are.BON JOVI: What comes through is joy. My goal with this record was to capture joy which for these last few years has been difficult, whether it’s the dark cloud of COVID that the world experienced or my own personal journey. With this record, I think we captured joy.",2024-04-24 05:38:58 AM EEST,NPR,"After 4 decades in music and major vocal surgery, Jon Bon Jovi is optimistic and still rocking",https://apnews.com/article/jon-bon-jovi-documentary-4382fb8723e8c6122ff7d7785871d626
None,"VIENNA (AP) — A portrait of a young woman by Gustav Klimt that was long believed to be lost was sold at an auction in Vienna on Wednesday for 30 million euros ($32 million).The Austrian modernist artist started work on the “Portrait of Fräulein Lieser” in 1917, the year before he died, and it is one of his last works. Bidding started at 28 million euros, and the sale price was at the lower end of an expected range of 30-50 million euros.The painting went to a bidder from Hong Kong, who wasn’t identified.The Im Kinsky auction house said that “a painting of such rarity, artistic significance, and value has not been available on the art market in Central Europe for decades.”The intensely colored painting was auctioned on behalf of the current owners, Austrian private citizens whose names weren’t released, and the legal heirs of Adolf and Henriette Lieser, one of whom is believed to have commissioned the painting. It’s not entirely clear which member of the Lieser family was the model.Klimt left the painting, with small parts unfinished, in his studio when he died of a stroke in early 1918 and it was given to the family who had commissioned it, according to the auction house.The Jewish family fled Austria after 1930 and lost most of their possessions.It’s unclear exactly what happened to the painting between 1925 and the 1960s, a period that includes the Nazi dictatorship. Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938.The auction house says there is no evidence that the painting was confiscated then, but also no proof that it wasn’t. It ended up with the current owners through three successive inheritances.In view of the uncertainty, an agreement was drawn up with the current owners and the Liesers’ heirs to go forward with the sale under the Washington Principles, which were drafted in 1998 to assist in resolving issues related to returning Nazi-confiscated art.The auction house said it was very happy with Wednesday’s result.The sale price was an art auction record for Austria. The highest price previously paid at an auction in the country was just over 7 million euros for a work by Frans Francken the Younger in 2010.",2024-04-24 20:19:19 PM EEST,NPR,A portrait by Gustav Klimt has been sold for $32 million at an auction in Vienna,https://apnews.com/article/austria-gustav-klimt-lieser-portrait-auction-a2935ec7ab5f2777f01c1de727540f76
The Associated Press,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Dick Van Dyke is vying for a historic Daytime Emmy at age 98.The actor was nominated Friday as guest performer in a daytime drama series for his part as amnesiac Timothy Robicheaux on Peacock’s “Days of Our Lives.”Van Dyke is the oldest Daytime Emmy nominee. Producer Norman Lear was 100 when he received his final Primetime Emmy nomination in 2022 and died the next year.Among those Van Dyke is up against is Australian actor Guy Pearce of Amazon Freevee’s “Neighbours.”Van Dyke has won four Primetime Emmys, including three in the 1960s for his classic comedy series “The Dick Van Dyke Show.”Actor-singer Selena Gomez is nominated in the culinary series category for her Food Network special “Selena + Chef: Home for the Holidays.” Also nominated in that category is Food Network’s “Valerie’s Home Cooking,” the show hosted by actor Valerie Bertinelli that ended last year.CBS is ending “The Talk” after its 15th season later this year.

Chevel Johnson Rodrigue,"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — It looks like the third time is the charm as the 2024 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage festival prepares, again, for The Rolling Stones to perform.The festival, which spans two weekends, is set to open Thursday with dozens of acts playing daily on 14 stages spread throughout the historic Fair Grounds race course. The Stones play next Thursday, May 2, tickets for which have long been sold out.In 2019, festival organizers thought they had landed the legendary rock band, but the appearance was canceled because lead singer Mick Jagger had heart surgery. They tried again in 2021, but a surge in COVID-19 cases ultimately forced the fest to cancel.Now, says festival producer Quint Davis, “It’s gonna be special.”This will be the first time the Stones play Jazz Fest.Opening day acts include rock bands Widespread Panic and The Beach Boys, reggae artist Stephen Marley and jazz vocalist John Boutte.“The talent is great, the weather is projected to be good and people’s expectations are going to be met,” Davis said.Blue skies, sunshine and temperatures in the 80s were forecast for opening day Thursday. Similar weather was expected for the rest of the first weekend, which runs through Sunday and showcases performances by Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter Jon Batiste, country megastar Chris Stapleton, R&B singer Fantasia, rock band Heart, Cajun fiddler Amanda Shaw and The Cute Guys, jazz pianist Patrice Rushen, and blues and folk artist Ruthie Foster.Anticipation for the Stones’ performance is palpable, Davis said.“All I’m hearing is ‘How can I get a ticket?’” he said of fans trying to see the marquee performance. “Unfortunately for some, that day sold out in like a day-and-a-half after tickets went on sale. I think people have just waited so long for this.”The Rolling Stones in October released “ Hackney Diamonds,” their first album of original material since 2005 and their first without drummer Charlie Watts, who died in 2021. Though he hasn’t seen a set list, Davis said fans can expect to hear a mix of greatest hits and new releases. No special guests are expected to perform with the Rolling Stones, but Davis said “never say never.”“Just expect euphoria,” he said laughing. “I think maybe we’re going to need some ambulances on site because people are going to spontaneously combust from the excitement. And, they’re playing in a daylight event. They’re gonna be able to make eye contact with the audience. That’s going to create a really special bond.”Acts on the festival’s 14 stages usually play simultaneously beginning when gates open at 11 a.m. and continuing until the music ends at 7 p.m. But the other stages will shut down next week when the Stones take the stage.“We didn’t want to have 13 empty stages and no people in front of them when the Stones start singing favorites like '(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction’ and ‘Jumpin’ Jack Flash,’” Davis said. “Everyone who bought a ticket for that day primarily bought one to see The Stones.”Davis said tickets for the festival’s other days remain available and can be purchased online through their website.Much of Jazz Fest celebrates the Indigenous music and culture of New Orleans and Louisiana but the music encompasses nearly every style imaginable: blues, R&B, gospel, Cajun, Zydeco, Afro-Caribbean, folk, Latin, rock, rap, contemporary and traditional jazz, country, bluegrass and everything in between.Colombia’s rhythms, from music to dance and food, also will be highlighted this year as part of the festival’s cultural exchange. Close to 200 Colombian artists are scheduled to participate, including headliners Bomba Estéreo on Saturday, ChocQuibTown’s lead singer Goyo in a guest appearance with local band ÌFÉ on Sunday, and salsa legends Grupo Niche closing the celebration on May 5.And don’t forget the food. During the festival, food available on site includes crawfish bread, pecan catfish meuniere and catfish almondine, cochon de lait and turducken po-boys, boudin, crawfish étouffée, jambalaya, crawfish Monica and shrimp and grits.",2024-04-25 07:35:21 AM EEST,NPR,"The Rolling Stones set to play New Orleans Jazz Fest 2024, opening Thursday",https://apnews.com/article/new-orleans-jazz-fest-rolling-stones-0dbe2f02d0ad5ff918f42d440425fa27
Terry Tang,"Like many little girls, a young Kristi Yamaguchi loved playing with Barbie. With a schedule packed with ice skating practices, her Barbie dolls became her “best friends.”So, it’s surreal for the decorated Olympian figure skater to now be a Barbie girl herself.“It’s a huge, huge honor. I think a lot of pride comes along with it, not just recognizing the Olympic achievement, but also being recognized during AAPI Month and following in the footsteps of some incredible women that I idolize — Anna May Wong, Maya Angelou and Rosa Parks,” Yamaguchi told The Associated Press. “It’s hard to see me put in the category with them.”Yamaguchi, who became the first Asian American to win an individual figure skating gold medal, at the 1992 Winter Olympics, has been immortalized as a doll for Barbie’s “Inspiring Women Series,” Mattel announced Wednesday. The release is timed for Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, in May.This isn’t Yamaguchi’s first doll depiction. In the ‘90s, touring show Stars on Ice put out a line of dolls modeled after notable skaters. The Barbie version is a lot more detailed.Mattel duplicated everything the then 20-year-old medalist wore at the Olympics in Albertville, France: the sparkling black-and-gold brocade outfit designed by Lauren Sheehan, the gold hair ribbon and even a red-and-white bouquet like Yamaguchi held atop the podium.Yamaguchi said both she and Sheehan are “just so tickled pink.”She also is happy with the doll’s visage.“It looks like me for sure. You know, the eyes and just the shape of the face. And then, of course, the hair, for sure. I mean, it has the bangs that are the ‘90s,” Yamaguchi said, chuckling.She appreciates that the doll’s release comes on the high heels of the blockbuster “Barbie” movie last year. Her daughters, ages 18 and 20, are fans of the Oscar-nominated film. Their initial reaction to their mother being a Barbie? Disbelief.“When they found out I was getting a doll, they were kind of flabbergasted and being like, ‘What? Like Mom, like how do you qualify? But that’s way too cool for you,’” Yamaguchi said.When Yamaguchi became a household name in the ‘90s, most Asian American children were growing up feeling like toys-aren’t-us kids. If you were an Asian parent looking for an Asian doll in the U.S., you likely turned to independent mail-order companies or waited until you were visiting your country of heritage.Since then, the toy market has evolved somewhat with big companies like Mattel diversifying and independent entrepreneurs filling the void. Two Asian doll lines — Jilly Bing and Joeydolls — launched within the last year, one by an Asian American mother and the other by an Asian Canadian mother. Both could not find dolls that looked like their daughters.Sapna Cheryan, a professor of psychology at the University of Washington who served a year on Mattel’s Barbie Global Advisory Council in 2018, said Asian Americans have long dealt with two stereotypes: the model-minority whiz kid or the perpetual foreigner. Toys can help dispel those myths, and instead signal acceptance and inclusivity.Dolls modeled after real people can get people talking about their human counterparts. Cheryan applauded Barbie’s choice of Yamaguchi.“There are so many Asian American athletes but they’re just not propped up in a way that athletes of other racial groups are,” said Cheryan, who researches cultural stereotypes and their impact on race and gender disparities. “Having a match in terms of racial identification or gender or both,” she said, is important in creating effective role models for kids.Mattel has mostly garnered praise for its diversity efforts but it’s had some missteps along the way. In 2021, the toy maker said it “fell short” by failing to include an Asian doll in a line of Tokyo Olympics-themed Barbies. In January, there was some backlash to Asian “You Can Be Anything” Barbies that seemed stereotypical. One was a violinist and the other a doctor in panda scrubs.Tying Yamaguchi to Barbie, a symbol of American pop culture, is especially remarkable considering what she and her family have dealt with as Japanese Americans. She has spoken about how her maternal and paternal grandparents were forced into U.S. incarceration camps in response to Japan’s 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor.When she captured the gold over 50 years later, media coverage partially focused on why she didn’t seem to have many endorsement deals. In an AP article from 1992, a sports advertising executive blamed her Japanese heritage, citing an economic climate that was anti-Japan. “It’s wrong, wrong, wrong, but that is the way it is,” the executive said.So while Barbie may seem like just a toy, it’s so much more for Yamaguchi.“When kids see themselves or see someone who inspires them, then it just opens up their world and their imagination to what’s possible,” she said.Tang is a Phoenix-based member of AP’s Race and Ethnicity team.

Hillel Italie,"NEW YORK (AP) — Nearly two years after the knife attack that nearly killed him, Salman Rushdie appears both changed and very much the same.Interviewed this week at the Manhattan offices of his longtime publisher, Random House, he is thinner, paler, scarred and blind in his right eye. He speaks of “iron” in his soul and the struggle to write his next full-length work of fiction as he concentrates on promoting “Knife,” a memoir about his stabbing that he took on if only because he had no choice.But he remains the engaging, articulate and uncensored champion of artistic freedom and the ingenious deviser of “Midnight’s Children” and other lauded works of fiction. He has been, and still is an optimist, helplessly so, he acknowledges. He also has the rare sense of confidence one can only attain through surviving one’s worst nightmare.“In ‘Midnight’s Children’ I wrote about optimism as a disease. People get infected by it and I think I got a lifetime infection,” he says.Chronologically, he is nearly 77, the age his father was when he died, an age he sees a kind of milestone in his own quest to beat expectations.Internally, he feels about 25.A self-described nice child, one who did not see himself as destined to get in trouble, Rushdie has had a life well beyond even his own boundless dreams. The 1981 Booker Prize win for “Midnight’s Children” established him as a dynamic voice of post-colonial literature. Nearly a decade later, he would reach a terrifying level of fame with “The Satanic Verses,” and the call for his death issued by Iran’s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.Rushdie was driven into hiding. But by August 2022, he had thought himself safe enough to address a conference in western New York with minimal security: No one was on hand to stop a young assailant, Hadi Matar, from rushing the stage and stabbing him repeatedly. Matar, then 24, has been charged with attempted murder and assault.Rushdie spoke to The Associated Press about why he wrote the explicit account of his attack, what he has learned about himself and what he might do next. This conversation has been edited for clarity and length.AP: When you started working on “Knife,” were you frightened at all?RUSHDIE: I was worried about retraumatization, that was the worry. And the first chapter, in which the actual attack is described in great detail — that was very goddamn hard to write.AP: You just got right to the point.RUSHDIE: Yeah. You know, don’t beat about the bush. Because the reason this book exists is because that happened.AP: Writers talk a lot about they don’t know how they really felt about something ...RUSHDIE: ... Until you write it down.AP: And is that how it was for you?RUSHDIE: Yeah. Also, I have a very good therapist and actually this is a book written also with the help of a therapist. I was talking to him every week, and discussing what I was doing. And he was helpful, actually. Very clear thinking and helped me clear my thinking. So that was something I had not done before.AP: You’ve discovered that you’re tougher than you thought you were.RUSHDIE: If you had told me that this was going to happen and how would I deal with it, I would not have been very optimistic about my chances.AP: Was there that fear in the back of your mind? You might not be able to handle this?RUSHDIE: I’m not good with fear. I’m not good with pain. You know, I’m just an ordinary guy hoping those things don’t happen, that you don’t have to deal with fear and pain.AP: I remember you writing about how, after the fatwa, there was a period where fiction was a struggle. Where are you in that place now?RUSHDIE: I don’t have the next novel. I hope I will, but the only fiction I’ve written since finishing this book is a kind of story. It’s a thing I don’t know quite what to do with. It’s a story that’s about 60 pages, 65 pages long. And I’m not sure whether to think it’s like a novella or whether I want to add to it and make it more, or that I want to cut it in half and make it a story.AP: So much of “Knife” is about reclaiming your life. Is one measure of being all the way back “I’ve got the next novel”?RUSHDIE: That will feel good. I’m always happiest when I have a book to write.AP: I would imagine there are a hundred different ways to look at the attack and the damage. But one way is, has it intruded upon your imagination?RUSHDIE: Well, it did. For six months after the attack, I couldn’t even think about writing. I wasn’t physically strong enough. And when I did sit down to write, initially, I didn’t want to write this book. I actually wanted to get back to fiction, and I tried and it just seemed stupid. I just thought, “Look, something very big happened to you.” And to pretend that it didn’t and just go on telling fairy tales would seem like — I would have felt like I was avoiding the subject.AP: Something that strikes me in this book is when the moment comes, there’s a voice inside you saying, “Well, here it is.” Even as you had gotten back to pretty much a normal life.RUSHDIE: I did think about it in the early years, obviously, when the danger level was very high. I did think about how somebody could come out of a crowd, and, I had had dreams about it before.AP: Was there ever that fear that maybe this was just your fate?RUSHDIE: No, I don’t believe in fate.AP: What do you believe in?RUSHDIE: Well, anti-fate.AP: Coincidence?RUSHDIE: Taking charge of your life is what I believe in.AP: One of the things I remember thinking when I first heard the news of the attacker was how young the attacker was. He wasn’t born when you wrote “Satanic Verses.”RUSHDIE: No, not for 10 years or something.AP: It’s as if you and that book are somehow fixed in the subconscious.RUSHDIE: And it’s not even the book because nobody takes the trouble to read it. It’s just the name of that book associated with me, me demonized as a bad guy. But I don’t know this man, you know? I mean, I know the little bits that we have been told — that his mother said after he came back from visiting his father in Lebanon that he was very different, much more religion oriented, critical of her for not having taught him properly about religion. And then for four years, in a basement.AP: It’s like you’re some kind of abstraction out there.RUSHDIE: I don’t know why it became me that after all this very long time in the basement, playing computer games and watching videos. Why it became me that he fixated on.AP: When you were growing up, did you imagine yourself as the type of person who would get in trouble?RUSHDIE: Not at all. I was a very quiet kid. I was really well behaved. My sister, who’s one year younger than me, she was the naughty one. She would beat people up for me and I would get her out of trouble.AP: You talk about you happy childhood, you’re a nice boy. But “Midnight’s Children,” so much of your work, you’re trying to get some kind of reaction.RUSHDIE: You’re trying to write a big book, you know?AP: And a book you probably knew might make somebody unhappy.RUSHDIE: Oh, yeah, but who cares, you know?AP: Where does that comes from?RUSHDIE: I had it as a child. I had the confidence of being loved and supported by my parents. And I’ve always been kind of academically excellent. So you grow up in that way. You give yourself permission to do things. Because you’ve been treated in that way. And also, of course, remember, I was 21 in 1968. I’m a child of the ‘60s.AP: How changed, if at all, do you think you are compared to two years ago?RUSHDIE: I’m still myself, you know, and I don’t feel other than myself. But there’s a little iron in the soul, I think. And I also think the thing that happens when you get really a close up look at death — that’s as close as you can get without actually doing the dance of death and heading off to nowhere — it stays with you.AP: What does that mean?RUSHDIE: It means there’s a shadow. It means the presence of the ending.AP: How old do you feel? Internally.RUSHDIE: (laughing) About 25.AP: You do?RUSHDIE: I think one of the great things about writing — you need a kind of youthfulness to do it, because it requires energy, imagination, dreaming. It’s a young man’s game. I’ve said somewhere that when you’re young and you’re writing, you have to fake wisdom. When you’re older and you’re writing, you have to fake energy.AP: Can you fake energy?RUSHDIE: Well, I’ve tried.",2024-04-19 22:48:45 PM EEST,NPR,"Has Salman Rushdie changed after his stabbing?

V. Ganeshananthan is nominated for her second novel, “Brotherless Night,” set during Sri Lanka’s civil war.Founded in 1996, the prize is open to female English-language writers from any country. Past winners include Zadie Smith, Tayari Jones and Barbara Kingsolver, who won last year for “Demon Copperhead.”This year, awards organizers launched a companion Women’s Prize for Nonfiction to help rectify an imbalance in publishing.

Jake Coyle,"NEW YORK (AP) — How sexy can a qualifying tennis tournament in New Rochelle, New York, be? When the on-court drama involves Zendaya, Josh O’Connor and Mike Faist, the answer turns out to be quite a bit more than your average USTA singles match in Luca Guadagnino’s “Challengers.”The film, directed by Guadagnino from a script by playwright Justin Kuritzkes, may have the appearance of a sports movie. Much of the action happens in between baselines. There are break points and short shorts. But in Guadagnino’s film, what’s being volleyed isn’t just a fuzzy little yellow ball.“The ball is the ephemeral, invisible force of desire,” says Guadagnino, the director of “Call Me By Your Name” and “Bones and All.” “I wanted to show desire going back and forth.”The result, by a score of about six-love, is the love triangle of the year. “Challengers,” which Amazon MGM Studios releases in theaters Friday, takes the melodrama of the threesome and gives it a breathless, bi-curious spin. That’s especially due to the multilateral chemistry between Zendaya, O’Connor and Faist — all actors in their late 20s or early 30s, all very capable of smoldering when called upon.It’s a big-screen statement especially for Zendaya, who’s also a producer on the film. She plays Tashi, the wife and coach of tennis superstar Art (Faist, the “West Side Story” breakout). Tashi was only relegated to the sidelines because of a career-ending knee injury — though it did little to sap her ambition. When Art, whose passion for tennis is fading, is matched in New Rochelle against an old friend, Patrick (O’Connor, star of Alice Rohrwacher’s recent “La Chimera” ), their complicated past is, deliciously, resurrected.Zendaya gravitated to the project not because it seemed a natural fit for her, but because it wasn’t.“Because it sounded like a challenge. Because it is so different from me,” Zendaya said in an interview alongside her co-stars. “Sometimes when you’re a little afraid to tackle something like that you, you’re like, ‘Oo, maybe I should do it.’ I don’t want to walk into something and be like, ‘I got this. This is going to be easy.’”“Challengers” was originally set to open last fall’s Venice Film Festival before it was postponed due to the actors strike. But the delay has only given more time for the buzz around the film to grow. That has a lot to do with the attention on everything Zendaya does, but it also has to do with how the film puts three exciting young actors in the center of the frame, and doesn’t let go.“What’s special is that the three of us got to lead the movie. That is cool,” says O’Connor. “An opportunity to do something like that is so rare.”“Sometimes I’ve been a part of big ensembles,” adds Zendaya, who co-starred in the recent “Dune: Part Two.” “But it’s just the three of us. We are the cast. While we obviously have other amazing actors that contribute, this is the core thing here. Tennis training and the rehearsal period, it was just us. So thank god that we like each other.”Guadagnino, known for his organic way of working, compares the weeks he and the three stars spent together preparing in Boston to “kids on the beach creating castles of sand.” Though Faist has some ability, the rest were hopeless at tennis. Guadagnino hadn’t picked up a racquet in his life before stepping onto the set in “Challengers.” Famed tennis coach Brad Gilbert was brought in to help.But “Challengers” isn’t really about tennis, that’s just the arena where attraction and emotion in the film ultimately spills out. When it’s pointed out to Guadagnino that the tennis scenes are essentially his movie’s sex scenes, he responds, “Thank you.”Faist, O’Connor and Zendaya all connected in different ways not just to how desire ebbs and flows but to how the characters are each juggling their fluctuating passions with their careers.“It is this constant navigation in what we do. Once a project is over then you’re kind of in limbo. You’re always trying to find that thing that sparks something inside of you,” Faist says. “It was something I really resonated with, that idea of falling in and out of love with your craft.”For Zendaya, the idea of having your craft ripped away, as it for Tashi, fueled arguably her finest film performance yet. “Challengers” is also the first time she’s leading a theatrical release.“I’m grateful that I picked a career that I can keep doing for as long as I want to. I can be 80 years old and still be making movies if I get lucky enough to be able to or if that’s something I still want to be do then,” Zendaya says. “I can’t imagine that idea of that life or thing that makes you happy or gives you power being ripped away from you. I deeply empathize with that.”Producer Amy Pascal first brought “Challengers” to Zendaya, a fittingly full-circle moment considering that Pascal cast Zendaya in her big-screen breakthrough, 2017’s “Spider-Man: Homecoming.” “Challengers,” though, signals a shift into more mature screen roles for the 27-year-old who from a young age as a Disney TV star had the responsibly of fame and providing for her family on her shoulders.“Something I deal with personally is the idea of what I should want, or what people want for me,” Zendaya says. “I empathize with that in Tashi but also in Art because he’s playing for two people. He’s not just selfishly playing for his own joy anymore, he’s playing for someone else. Sometimes our work can feel like that, too. We’re playing for the benefit of other people, what people want for us, rather than what really would just make you happy.”For Zendaya, Faist and O’Connor, “Challengers” allowed them to, when not busy steaming up the screen, wrestle with their own ambitions. O’Connor, who portrayed Prince Charles on “The Crown,” shot “La Chimera” — playing a character he more closely identified with — in between a very different role in “Challengers.”“He is front-footed, he’s overly confident — all these qualities that I’ve always admired and always wanted that I’ve never quite been able to have. Just to play it and be in his shoes for a few months was bliss,” says O’Connor. “That’s what I’ll hold on to with Patrick. I really like Patrick. I know he’s problematic but I really like him. I find him hilarious and charming and he knows himself. And those are all qualities that I don’t necessarily have but I admire in him.”The connections and challenges each star brought to “Challengers” added up to a remarkably intimate drama and a potentially career-shifting experience. Even Guadagnino, who generally prefers editing to shooting, found his time on hard court with Zendaya, O’Connor and Faist to be enthralling.“It was joyous and it was a nice and it was energetic,” says Guadagnino. “It was a good company.”Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP",2024-04-23 22:19:12 PM EEST,NPR,"Zendaya, Josh O’Connor and Mike Faist on the steamy love triangle of ‘Challengers’",https://apnews.com/article/zendaya-challengers-josh-oconnor-mike-faist-cdd1ba49e945ecd6324e1bf04ea1fa99
Sophia Rosenbaum,"NEW YORK (AP) — “Nothing forces you to face your demons like falling in love.”And it’s almost always worth it, Emily Henry says during a recent interview ahead of Tuesday’s release of her latest novel, “Funny Story.” She would know, having churned out a new bestselling romance read every year since 2020.“You find out so much about yourself by how you react to the complicated feelings of falling in love, and that can lead into something very toxic and exhausting. But it also can lead into something so beautiful and life changing,” she says.Henry talked with The Associated Press about her journey to becoming a novelist, why people shouldn’t feel shame about reading romance and how her personal mental health journey influences her characters. She also dives into whether books are better than movies, with a few insights into the film adaptions of her books in the works.This interview has been edited for clarity and length.HENRY: You could try writing a book. That’s only halfway a joke, because I really do feel like “Beach Read” was the most meta thing I’d ever done.There’s a reason that most of my books have ended with one or both characters going to therapy. For a happy ending to be sustained, for a relationship to continue growing and changing, you probably need some help.Also getting on medicine was huge for me. I thought I was doing more or less OK until I found out what it felt like to be OK.HENRY: Because I’m in a steady, stable relationship, it’s really easy to romanticize those early phases. But then when I’m talking to my single friends, I’m like, “Oh yeah, it is hell.” I feel like I have such affection for that phase when you don’t know for sure how the other person feels. It’s like a feeling you don’t get from many other things in life.HENRY: Contemporary romance has tried to move toward something that’s a little bit more grounded and more realistic with a focus on the health of a relationship and the positivity of it.It’s interesting that it has been treated as a guilty pleasure for so long. There’s a wide variety of romance and erotica that leaves room for people to have their fantasies and that’s separate from the real world.HENRY: Try to enjoy writing before you publish, because it is really strange how much it changes once it belongs to the world.It’s sort of like you have to appreciate your single days if you’re trying to wind up in a serious partnership. It can be horrible and terrible, but when it’s fun, try to live that up, because that also is an experience you’re someday probably not going to have again.HENRY: I am very close with two of the directors who’ve been formally announced for “People We Meet on Vacation” and “Beach Read.” I feel really lucky that they want to know what the readers care about.HENRY: No, you know how it is. They’re all still in early-ish phases of development. So hopefully more soon.HENRY: What’s cool about film is the exact thing that also makes it tricky for adaptation, which is it’s no longer the reader and the writer collaborating.The books will always be the books. I have started to think about the adaptations more along the lines of a Broadway show or a “Batman” franchise. Batman is Batman, but there are a lot of different Batmans.The movies are all going to be something very special. And I think that they’ll have the heart of the books, hopefully.HENRY: Primarily joy. I’m always trying to balance the joy of life and the pain of life. I want it to feel like this is the book you want to buy at the airport and read on the plane or on the beach.HENRY: Every book I do is taking the hardest parts of life and not trying to justify them, but trying to balance them against the best parts of life and leave the reader with the feeling that the hard shit that you’re going through is worth it for the experience of getting to love and be loved. Not necessarily romantically — any kind of love.You cannot love anyone without accepting that there’s a real chance of grief, whether that’s a breakup or a loss.

Andrea Rodríguez,"HAVANA (AP) — His novels recount gruesome murders, thefts, scams, bribes and humiliating secrets. But those are not even the most important themes in the stories told by award-winning Cuban writer Leonardo Padura.For the last four decades, Padura, 68, has managed to turn his series of detective thrillers into a social and political chronicle of Cuba, especially Havana, where he has lived all his life.The island he depicts in his books — which have been translated to dozens of languages — is a mix of economic deprivation, Afro-descendant syncretism, corruption, mischief, uplifting music and growing inequality — all seasoned by a revolution that marked the 20th century.“I write about the problems of individuals in Cuban society. And often, in my books, more than dramatic conflicts between the characters, you will find a social conflict between the characters and their historical time,” Padura told The Associated Press in a recent interview at his home in Mantilla, the populous Havana neighborhood where he was born, raised and married.The scent of freshly brewed coffee is in the air, as well as the chirping sound of the birds that inhabit the patio where his dogs are buried. In a nearby studio, his wife, screenwriter Lucía López Coll, works on a computer.It’s also in this house where Mario Conde, the principal character of Padura’s work, was born. The downtrodden, nostalgic, chain-smoking detective has accompanied Padura since 1991, when “Past Perfect” — the first of the “Havana Quartet” series featuring Conde as the main protagonist — was published.Keeping track of Detective Conde is almost like taking the pulse of Cuba in the last few years.His last appearance was in the 2020 novel “Personas Decentes” (“Decent People”) in which, now over 60 years old, Conde gets involved in the investigation of a homicide — and corruption case — against the backdrop of the 2016 historic visit of former U.S. President Barack Obama and the Rolling Stones to the island.“This character comes from a neighborhood similar to mine,” Padura says of Conde. “He is a man of my generation. ... His view of reality has evolved because I have evolved, and his feeling of disenchantment has a lot to do with the way we have been living all these years.”Reflecting on Cuba’s situation after the tightening of U.S. sanctions during the administration of President Donald Trump and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, Padura says the island has barely crawled out of the crisis and has not yet been able to get back on its feet.He points at the lack of food and medications, rising prices and deteriorating health and education systems, while Cubans grapple with fuel shortages and constant blackouts.“There is a historical fatigue,” he says. “People are tired, they have no alternatives and they look for one by emigrating.”The soft-spoken chronicler highlights yet another impact of Cuba’s ongoing economic crisis: A wave of popular protests and demonstrations that had not been seen in decades.“The main cry was for food and electricity,” Padura recalls about the protests in 2021 and, more recently, in March. “But people also screamed ‘Freedom!’ The lack of food and electricity might have been solved by fixing some thermoelectric plants and with a little rice and sugar ... but the other thing has not been talked about — and I think it’s something that should be discussed in depth.”Born in 1955, Leonardo de la Caridad Padura Fuentes studied literature at the University of Havana and worked as a journalist for state-owned media in the 1980s.He has won a number of important prizes, including the Hammett Prize, awarded by the International Association of Crime Writers, on two occasions (1998 and 2006); Cuba’s National Prize for Literature In 2012, and the Princess of Asturias Award for literature in Spain in 2015.In 2016, Netflix released “Four Seasons in Havana,” a miniseries featuring detective Conde.Despite the international recognition, only a few of Padura’s books have been published in Cuba, and when they do, only a few copies are printed. Also, because of his critical, sometimes dark view of the island, his work is barely promoted or mentioned in the official media.Unlike many writers and intellectuals who in recent years decided to leave Cuba, Padura — who travels extensively — is determined to stay.“I have many reasons for living outside of Cuba but I think the ones that keep me here weigh more heavily. One of them is my sense of belonging,” he says. “I have a strong sense of belonging to a reality, to a culture, to a way of seeing life, to a way of expressing myself.”Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",2024-04-23 08:15:06 AM EEST,NPR,Writer Leonardo Padura chronicles life in Cuba as his detective ‘alter ego’ solves gripping crimes,https://apnews.com/article/leonardo-padura-detective-novels-havana-cuba-literature-4400c483f6e1fecd14875f2d853c08eb

The Associated Press,"The Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell romantic comedy “Anyone But You” hitting Netflix and an album by Brazil superstar Anitta are some of the new television, movies, music and games headed to a device near you.Also among the streaming offerings worth your time as selected by The Associated Press’ entertainment journalists: Everyone’s favorite dancing demon doll “M3GAN” comes back to Peacock, a beautiful woman battles hideous beasts in Sony’s video game Stellar Blade, and a documentary detailing Bon Jovi’s early days, rise to fame and breakups and breakdowns.— The Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell romantic comedy “Anyone But You” is finally on Netflix starting Tuesday. The movie is about two young singles whose magical one-night stand ends in miscommunication and hurt feelings, and then find themselves both in a small family wedding party and staying in the same house. It’s loosely based on Shakespeare’s “Much Ado About Nothing.” Reviews were mixed and the box office started out tame, but it became a slow burn sleeper hit in theaters, earning more than $218 million worldwide. If you’ve been holding out to see what the fuss was about, now is your low stakes chance (it’s also not a bad plane option, which is where this film critic finally watched it). And afterwards, if you need a rom-com palate cleanser, “You’ve Got Mail” is also currently on Netflix.— Another stealth box office hit, everyone’s favorite dancing demon doll “M3GAN” is coming back to Peacock starting Wednesday. Is it great cinema? Probably not, but everyone who watches it seems to have a fun time (in spite of themselves). Entertainment Weekly’s Leah Greenblatt wrote in her review that, “This is not the morose, carnage-soaked horror of dank basements and clammy night terrors; most of the movie happens in bright daylight, every maniacal head tilt, ungodly hip swivel, and murder-by-gardening-tool calibrated for screams that end not with a gasp but a giggle. M3GAN came to play, and possibly reboot her motherboard for a sequel. Are you not entertained?”— Finally, if you’ve exhausted all your “Tortured Poets” analysis, you can pivot to watching a Joe Alwyn movie instead. He stars in Claire Denis’ 2022 romantic thriller “Stars at Noon,” which comes to Hulu on Sunday, April 28.

The only Bon Jovi documentary series to feature all members past and present, “Thank You, Goodnight: The Bon Jovi Story” premieres on Hulu Friday, April 26 in the U.S., Star+ in Latin America and Disney+ in all other territories. Binge all four-parts one after the other or dole them out slowly. However you do it, expect to have “Livin’ On A Prayer” stuck in your head for the next week.— Anitta, arguably Brazil’s most recognizable global pop singer since Astrud Gilberto sang “The Girl From Ipanema” nearly 60 years ago, is preparing to release a new album Friday, April 26. It’s titled “Funk Generation,” her first since the 2022’s “Versions of Me,” and its viral hits “Envolver” and “Girl From Rio” (with its interpolation of the Gilberto classic) made her an international star. She’s long aimed to bring Brazilian sounds to the worldwide music market, and focusing on Brazilian funk is an extension of that desire. “’Funk Generation’ is an album where I celebrate my roots. It’s where I express the power of Rio’s funk in every track its unique, danceable, and sensual beats,” she said in a statement. “It’s a rhythm born in the favelas, where I grew up, and it exudes resistance and art in every community.”— It is time to give Midwest MCs their flowers: Fresh off a tour opening for Migos rapper Offset, Detroit’s Skilla Baby is preparing to drop a new project on Friday, April 26, “The Coldest.” If his trap earworm “Bae,” with its celebratory, ladies-first lyrics (“Bae, you know you’re fine, don’t you?” in the chorus) and the community-focused “Plate” are a taste of what’s to come, the release is going to be delicious.— AP Music Writer Maria Sherman— “The Big Door Prize,” a sweet, silly dramedy about the residents of a small town turned upside down by the arrival of a machine that reveals a person’s true calling, returns for a second season on Apple TV+. Starring Chris O’Dowd as a local high school teacher, “The Big Door Prize” is based on a book by M.O. Walsh and was one of The Associated Press’ TV shows worth watching in 2023. Season two of “The Big Door Prize” debuts Wednesday. Season one is also still available on the streamer.— Two teen ghost detectives who appear in DC comic books star in their own series called “Dead Boy Detectives.” The story follows Edwin and Charles, two long-dead teens who spend their afterlife still on Earth and investigating paranormal cases. They’re assisted by a living teen named Crystal Palace who is a clairvoyant. “Dead Boy Detectives” also features Lukas Gage in an over-the-top, comedic role of the Cat King. “The Summer I Turned Pretty” actor David Iacono plays a demon. The ghostly investigations begin Thursday on Netflix.— Idris Elba and Adam Pally reprise their “Sonic the Hedgehog” characters for the new animated series “Knuckles” on Paramount+. Elba plays Knuckles, an Echidna with super strength, who is adjusting after moving to Earth at the end of “Sonic the Hedgehog 2.” Pally is Wade Whipple, a not-so-bright deputy sheriff. “Knuckles” is part of Paramount’s efforts to expand the popular “Sonic” brand.

Start swinging Friday, April 26, on PlayStation 5.— Electronic Arts’ Tales of Kenzera: Zau is less campy and more down to earth. Its protagonist, Zau, aims to become a healer and, maybe, bring his father back from the Land of the Dead. The aspiring shaman has some nifty parkour skills as well as sun and moon masks, which allow him to, respectively, launch spears and manipulate time as he fights evil spirits. Tales of Kenzera is the debut title from Surgent Studios, which was founded by voice actor Abubakar Salim, and he says it was inspired by Bantu folklore as well as his own experience with grief.

Carla K. Johnson,"It’s easier than ever for doctors to prescribe a key medicine for opioid addiction since the U.S. government lifted an obstacle last year. But despite the looser restrictions and the ongoing overdose crisis, a new study finds little change in the number of people taking the medication.Researchers analyzed prescriptions filled by U.S. pharmacies for the treatment drug buprenorphine. The number of prescribers rose last year after doctors no longer needed to get a special waiver to prescribe the drug, while the number of patients filling prescriptions barely budged.It may take more than one year to see a bigger increase in patients, said study co-author Dr. Kao-Ping Chua of the University of Michigan Medical School.“There are so many other barriers to prescribing that we have to address,” said Chua.The findings were published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.Buprenorphine, which helps with cravings, comes in a pill or film that dissolves under the tongue. It costs about $100 a month. A common version of buprenorphine is Suboxone. Nurse practitioners, physician assistants and doctors can prescribe it.“People think this is a very complicated medicine and that it requires some sort of complex knowledge to use, when that’s just not the case,” said Dr. Ryan Marino of Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland who has treated hundreds of people with buprenorphine. He had no role in the study.Barriers include insurance hurdles, price, pharmacies that don’t stock the drug and doctors who believe patients with addiction take up too much time, Chua and other experts said.“There’s a lot of stigma about this medication, and just in general about patients with opioid addiction,” Chua said.In addition, some people may not want to try buprenorphine, Chua said. They may think they can’t truly recover if they’re using the opioid-based medication, he said. And it can trigger withdrawal symptoms, especially in people who’ve been using fentanyl, the powerful opioid now dominating the drug supply.The researchers used a database that captures 92% of filled prescriptions. Comparing 2022 and 2023, before and after the waiver was eliminated, they found 53,600 prescribers at the end of 2023, a 27% increase compared to a year earlier. The number of people filling prescriptions rose about 2% to around 845,000.The government should look for ways to encourage and even compel hospitals and health systems to provide more treatment, said Brendan Saloner, an addiction researcher at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who was not involved in the study.More doctors are prescribing buprenorphine, but “getting the bulk of the medical profession to catch up is taking too long,” Saloner said.The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Sophia Rosenbaum,"“Funny Story” isn’t a funny story at all. But it is a good one.Emily Henry’s new romance novel starts with dueling breakups that have rocked the two main characters’ worlds — and forced them to bond over their shared broken hearts.Daphne is a planner who is always on time. She’s a buttoned-up librarian who hosts a lively children’s reading hour and keeps her personal life closed off from her colleagues.Miles is more subdued. He’s nice, thoughtful and able to win over anyone he’s talking to, especially the regulars he sees on his weekend trips to the farmers market. He doesn’t have much of a relationship with his parents, for myriad reasons, but he’s very close to his younger sister.Daphne and Miles’ story starts as they navigate their newly single lives now that their exes are dating ... each other.They go through the throes of grieving together, with a soundtrack of love songs accompanying each phase. It’s practically begging for a movie version, to go along with the several other Henry books already in various stages of production.Early on, they decide to pretend they’re dating to make their exes jealous. But as time goes on, they discover that they see each other as more than friends, that they really are falling for each other.“Funny Story” is Henry’s latest romance — and her steamiest one so far. It’s a mixture of will-they-won’t-they in a way that makes you really want them to. They’re the protagonists in separate love stories who are brought together by heartbreak. Daphne and Miles are characters you can empathize with and root for.And “Funny Story” is classic Henry. It’s a meet-cute in a non-patronizing way. It’s a modern love story, and one that you won’t be mad is slightly predictable — because it makes you feel good and makes you believe in a thing called love.“So many of the most beautiful things in life are unexpected,” Henry writes.It’s funny how life and love are both that way.AP book reviews: https://apnews.com/hub/book-reviews",2024-04-22 17:58:22 PM EEST,NPR,Book Review: Emily Henry is still the modern-day rom-com queen with ‘Funny Story’,https://apnews.com/article/emily-henry-funny-story-book-review-c36579dfacb77db2ee9786b2356a44d5
Lindsey Bahr,"“ The Beautiful Game,” a new movie starring Bill Nighy and Michael Ward, is about a real international soccer tournament called the Homeless World Cup.Don’t go in expecting documentary realness or grit, however. This is a movie-movie (debuting on Netflix on Friday, tidily constructed to leave audiences feeling inspired and uplifted. Mind you, this isn’t a bad thing – verité authenticity has its place but so do well constructed, glossy fantasies that still evoke authentic emotion and get at some essential truths. “ The Beautiful Game,” directed by Thea Sharrock, is firmly the latter. Just managing expectations.The first Homeless World Cup was held in 2003, and in the past two decades, nearly 70 countries and 1.2 million people have participated. And yet, I suspect, its existence might come as a surprise to many (even soccer fans …excuse me, football). The foundation’s goals are noble, raising awareness for homelessness in major world cities and giving players a sense of pride and community.Colin Farrell, who narrated the 2008 documentary about the games (“Kicking It,” currently streaming on Freevee ) and has since become an ambassador for the foundation, is one of the main producers on the film. Screenwriter Frank Cotrell-Boyce also worked with the foundation and past participants to inspire the characters he’d end up writing. It may be a movie, but it has legitimacy in its bones.If you have a “Ted Lasso” shaped hole in your heart (or, less dramatically, viewing schedule), or are still feeling burned from Taika Waititi’s misfire “Next Goal Wins,” this might just do the trick. Ward is Vinny, a down-on-his-luck dad to a young girl who also happens to be an immensely talented player. But he’s not remotely ready to join any team, even one going to a real tournament in Rome, that has the word “homeless” in it.Nighy plays Mal, a kind and soft-spoken (except when a ref makes a bad call) football legend who coaches the homeless England team: Nathan (Callum Scott Howells), Aldar (Robin Nazari), Kevin (Tom Vaughan-Lawlor), Cal (Kit Young) and Jason (Sheyi Cole). They all have stories of how they got where they were, but all are kind and eager and excited to play. Vinny is the stick in the mud, making things tense and awkward at every turn. Essentially, he thinks he’s better than his teammates on the field and off, which of course says more about him than the other guys.While Vinny and the England team are the primary focus, there are b-plots given to Japan, a first-time team full of slightly older players and an ambitious young coach (Aoi Okuyama), America, a woman’s team with a star player (Cristina Rodlo), and to South Africa, the best of the bunch under the leadership of a shrewd nun Protasia (Susan Wokoma). For an ensemble as big as this, the story does an admirable job of giving most something meaningful to do. It’s not a bad travelogue for Rome either, and it’s also always nice to have a dash of Valeria Golino, who is leading the tournament.Is it a little glossy and sanitized with a jaunty score? Sure. But it also thoughtfully explores themes of redemption, invisibility, pride and sportsmanship without being preachy or condescending. It’s PG-13 rating is a little puzzling — this does seem on the tamer end of the scale and appropriate for most ages. And, not for nothing, Sharrock and her team do a good job of showing just how exciting soccer can be (which is not a feat many movies have accomplished).“The Beautiful Game,” a Netflix release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for “some language, a suggestive reference, brief partial nudity and drug references.” Running time: 125 minutes.

Jake Coyle,"In writer-director-star Joanna Arnow’s “The Feeling That the Time for Doing Something Has Passed,” Ann (Arnow), a 30-something New Yorker, lies naked in bed with an older man, Allen (Scott Cohen), with whom she has a yearslong BDSM relationship. She tells him she’s grateful he only cares about his own pleasure.“It’s like I don’t even exist,” she says.Much is just out of reach in Arnow’s shrewdly perceptive and very funny new film. Love, certainly, is nowhere near Ann’s life despite a series of romantic encounters. Music is talked about — from Andrew Lloyd Webber showtunes to the team cheer from “A League of Their Own” — but seldom heard. In one scene during a tryst with a composer, Ann says her favorite soundtrack is “In the Act of Wishing for Love,” but she means “In the Mood for Love.”Even Ann’s existential crisis doesn’t quite materialize in this unwaveringly sardonic portrait of millennial malaise. Her life plays out in a series of brief, crispy edited vignettes that jump between her drab work life and her extreme but equally drab sex life.Obedience is pushed on her in both places, as are labels, most of which Ann quietly but not necessarily apathetically accepts. One partner (Parish Bradley) who instructs her to communicate in “a series of oinks” writes the lewd name he’s given her across her belly in marker. At work, an unseen HR gives her a new job title: “Clinical Media E-learning Specialist.” Which is worse is hard to say. After three years on the job, she’s given a one-year anniversary trophy.How Ann feels about all of this isn’t always obvious, possibly even to her. Arnow portrays her much as she directs and edits the film, with a detached deadpan. Sometimes Ann pushes back. She tells her older lover that she’s not an Internet window he can open and close. But there’s also something in Ann that recoils against more sentimental encounters. Later in the film, she begins dating someone sweetly if naively romantic (Babak Tafti) who’s unfamiliar with the kind of bondage role-playing Ann is accustomed to. But his sweetness is more of a strike against him. Ann may be a victim of her modern, alienating environment, but she’s also a product of it.Arnow, who also made the 2013 film “I hate myself :)” has often been compared to Lena Dunham as a generation-representing voice, for her willingness to bear all on screen and for her proclivity for autobiography. (Ann’s parents in the film are played by Arnow’s real-life mother and father, Barbara Weiserbs and David Arnow.)But Arnow’s sensibility is much dryer and more satirical. Whether Ann can free herself of her circumstance is one thing, but Arnow, as a keenly insightful filmmaker, proves again and again that she has. How else can you explain the trenchant absurdity of the poem-worthy dialogue that runs through the film? A sexual partner whose first line is: “Thank you for forgiving me for mansplaining about L.A.” A boss who announces: “If you’re not on Spotify, you’re behind the times.” And Ann, who after debasing herself with her older lover, says, “The candles were nice,” only for him to reply: “There was just one candle.”“The Feeling That the Time for Doing Something Has Passed,” a Magnolia Pictures release, is unrated by the Motion Picture Association but contains adult nudity and language.

Jake Coyle,"Forty years after “Ghostbusters” and following a string of sequels that never measured up to the 1984 original — beginning all the way back with 1989’s “Ghostbusters II” — it’s fair to wonder, well, who else ought we to call? It may be time to, if not give up the ghost entirely, at least give a flip through the ol’ rolodex.But as the lackluster 2021 installment, “Ghostbusters: Afterlife” showed, the half life of most film franchises today is an ever-lengthening long tail of diminishing returns. Though the options are many, sucking “Ghostbusters” dry would make a prime exhibit in Hollywood’s nostalgia fix.Still, it’s not quite as simple as that. I’m glad for the female-led 2016 “Ghostbusters.” Aside from prompting a minor culture war, it assembled the best comic ensemble since the original with Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones and, yes, Chris Hemsworth.And as easy as it might be to label the new one, “Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire,” another half-hashed retread — which it is, a little bit — it’s also a significant upgrade from “Afterlife,” which relocated the action to Oklahoma and forgot to pack any comedy. “Frozen Empire,” back, thankfully, in New York, is a breezier, more serviceable sequel that has a modest charm as an ’80-tinged family adventure.The innate appeal of “Ghostbusters” had to do with its brash mixing of genres — adult-edged comedy with sci-fi toys — that summoned the spirit of “Abbott of Costello Meet Frankenstein.” When the sequels have gone astray, it’s usually because they get bogged down with solemnity or special effects when all they really need is the it’s-the-end-of-the-world-and-I-feel-fine smirk of Bill Murray. I’d forgive bad visual effects a lot sooner than I would bland comic interplay.“Frozen Empire,” though, is organized less around a group of funny people wearing proton packs than it is around a family. The movie more or less opens with the Ectomobile racing down Fifth Avenue with Gary (Paul Rudd) at the wheel, Callie (Carrie Coon) riding shotgun and her kids — Trevor (Finn Wolfhard) and Phoebe (Mckenna Grace) — in the back, all in bickering pursuit of a “sewer dragon” apparition.The cast is much the same as “Afterlife,” but the behind-the-scenes talent has been rejiggered. After Jason Reitman took over directing from his father, Ivan Reitman, he here is credited as a producer and writer. Gil Kenan, who co-wrote “Afterlife,” directs “Frozen Empire,” which is dedicated to the elder Reitman, who died in 2022.More than before, you can feel the growing distance from the original “Ghostbusters.” Harold Ramis died in 2014 and while Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson all return, they no longer feel like the axis to this cinematic universe. (Aykroyd, though, gives the movie some soulful quirk as Dr. Raymond Stantz, and Ernie Hudson may be more a potent presence than ever.)Familiar-faced ghosts return, too, in “Frozen Empire,” which, like its predecessor, doesn’t skimp on the fan service. That instinct to cater to “Ghostbusters” diehards (a kind of ridiculous kind of diehard, if we’re being honest) continues to diminish a franchise that recoiled defensively after the 2016 “Ghostbusters.”But if you accept the low-bar aspirations of “Frozen Empire,” you may get a pleasant-enough experience out of it. It’s a movie that feels almost more like a high production-value TV pilot for an appealing sitcom, with Rudd as the stepfather, than it does a big-screen event on par with the original.The family has moved into the famed fire station, but trouble abounds. The contamination unit is stuffed, the mayor (Walter Peck, who played the nemesis EPA inspector in the 1984 film) wants to evict and there are disturbing rumblings connected with an object that turns up — the Orb of Garraka — that may awaken a particularly fearsome spirit.People get slimed. Ghosts get busted. New Yorkers shrug. The formula is adhered to, albeit with a few lively twists. The standout here is Grace, who’s drawn into a brief but tender relationship with a ghost (played alluringly by Emily Alyn Lind) after a nighttime chess match in Washington Square Park. And Kumail Nanjiani more or less steals the movie playing a Queens man and reluctant heir to the mystic role of “Firemaster.” He’s funny enough that you’re almost convinced, in an overextended movie franchise, not to give up the ghost just yet.“Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire,” a Sony Pictures release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for supernatural action/violence, language and suggestive references.

Mark Kennedy,"“Housekeeping for Beginners” begins with a shot of a painting on a wall hanging just a little askew. It’s an apt metaphor for what’s in store.Writer and director Goran Stolevski gives us an atypical family portrait that’s brilliantly political without being preachy, loving without being maudlin and epic by being specifically tiny.This is the complex story set mostly in a villa outside Skopje, the capital city of North Macedonia, that has become a refuge for those not in the mainstream — queer, Roma or a mix of both, ethnic minorities colliding with sexual ones in a repressive, traditional society.Shot entirely with handheld cameras and using subtitles, “Housekeeping for Beginners” may seem daunting at first as viewers are thrust into a chaotic, multigenerational household with no navigation.But Stolevski’s use of cinema verite — shaky close-ups, capturing routine things like the brushing of teeth — and globalization mean we see things we know even if it is North Macedonia — boring bus commutes, Grindr, the joy of picking up kids from kindergarten, Adidas footwear and singing loudly along to very bad pop songs in the living room. They might be Serbian pop songs, but no matter.Eventually, Romanian actress Anamaria Marinca — absolutely brilliant — emerges as the fulcrum. She is Dita, a no-nonsense Albanian healthcare worker and den mother with a deep well of love and patience. Along for the ride is her Roma lover and her two children, her longtime Albanian gay friend Toni and his younger lover Ali, and various young social exiles who have found the home a good place to figure out who they are.In the first half, Dita’s partner, Suada, faces a health scare and the household must try to adjust if she doesn’t make it. As a single mother, Suada pleads with Dita to legally adopt her two girls — one a sullen teen and the other an exuberant 5-year-old. Without legal protection, who knows what will happen to them in a world where their ethnicity is denigrated?The movie’s second half shows this ragtag family trying to pass as what passes for normal — Dita and Toni going to parties pretending to be a couple, the two girls pretending both of the adults are their parents. “Nothing has to change,” Dita tells them, but the strain of not being who they are is overwhelming.Cinematographer Naum Doksevski’s camera spins and swoops as the family bursts out of his frame, constantly in motion and animated. Scenes never really end, just become a hectic series of vivid postcards adding up to an emotional connection as various hotheaded decisions threaten to rip this family apart.In addition to Marinca, Samson Selim is superb as the sweet young lover to Ali, instantly a protector and big brother to the youngest daughter, trying to ensure her childhood is loving and happy, something his eyes say he did not enjoy himself. Vladimir Tintor, who plays Toni, is a stoic slow-burner but powerfully reveals the fear of being aged out of love.A neat conclusion is not in store for this family, but a satisfying one is. Like magnets pulled together, the various pieces might fly apart but there’s a grudging admiration and appreciation that keeps them together. It’s love and that’s the same in the Balkans or Brazil.It may come as somewhat of a shock to discover that the movie, so rooted in North Macedonia, could have been set elsewhere. The Macedonia-born, Australia-based Stolevski initially considered Australia. And that’s the point: It’s what happens in the house that matters, not where the house is.“Housekeeping for Beginners,” a Focus Features release, is rated R for “sexual content, language throughout and some teen drinking.” Running time: 107 minutes.

Lindsey Bahr,"Steve Martin has never been one to follow any sort of playbook. It is fitting the first official documentary about his life is similarly unconventional: A freewheeling story told in two parts, one part focused on “Then” and one part focused on “Now” (kind of) with both parts debuting on Apple TV+ on Friday. Both documentarian and subject are trying, the best they can, to make sense of whatever “Steve Martin” is.Directed by self-proclaimed superfan Morgan Neville (the Oscar-winner who has told the story of Fred Rogers and Anthony Bourdain), “STEVE! (martin)” never commits to one form. Like its subject, it allows itself to be a little looser, utilizing every technique available to help paint a truer picture of Martin, a man so enigmatic that his close friends don’t even seem to have a handle on him. He’d hardly be the first performer to save it all for the stage: Martin says that it was somewhat comforting to be able to put on a persona during shows. He was also able to continually reinvent himself. Who else could have walked away from stand-up just as they’d reached rock star status?And so the medium becomes a kitchen sink: There is stock footage, animation, reenactment, home videos, movie clips, stand-up segments, talk show appearances, new interviews with famous friends (Martin and Jerry Seinfeld in conversation, for example), scripted voiceover and some fly-on-the-wall footage of him just spending time with Martin (Marty) Short bike riding, walking through town, playing cards and workshopping jokes for their show. It’s probably the only way to capture an artist who has taken the hyphenate to absurd levels: Magician/balloon artist/novelist/banjo player/screenwriter/essayist/art collector/joke teller/cartoonist/movie star/father/husband/friend. What am I missing?For anyone who’s read Martin’s memoir “Born Standing Up,” “Then” might not be especially revelatory, but it’s all context and it remains interesting to hear Martin reflect candidly on a moment that now feels “like a blip.” While he might not have had a plan, he did possess a keen sense of when he’d hit a dead end, whether that be in magic, stand-up or even movies.His life in movies is saved for “Now,” and you see someone still struggling with the agony of never really knowing if a thing would work. Everyone misses once in a while, but Martin had a brutal back-to-back of a wild success in “The Jerk” followed by an epic flop in “Pennies From Heaven” and that was just the start of his rollercoaster in Hollywood. He’s kind of moved on from that (and “Mixed Nuts”) but also kind of not. He said he had to do 40 movies to get five good ones. He’s being a little sarcastic, but hopefully he knows that a lot of people out there love far more than a measly five Steve Martin movies.It is especially fascinating to get a glimpse into his complex relationship with critics and how he found an outlet in writing both fiction and non-fiction. Personally, I wish even more time had been spent on the movies and his writings, like “Shopgirl.” Everyone is bound to have a favorite that this doesn’t cover enough.If you want to keep Steve Martin in your mind as that wild and crazy guy, or George Banks or Navin or Lucky Day (the list could go on), and don’t care about his relationship with his father, his decision to become a father late in life, reflections on his art collection, the memorabilia he kept over the years and the things he didn’t do that he wishes he did, these films might not be for you. There are no rules to being a fan. For some, biography can mean everything. For others, it matters little when there’s so much joy to be had without it.Martin, who has been both an open book in some ways and also guarded in others, is really quite vulnerable here — especially in “Now.” Neville captures him looking at the script for “Planes, Trains and Automobiles” and reflecting on his late friend and co-star John Candy. There was a great monologue, he said, in which Candy’s Del Griffith tells the story of his life. Martin recalled bawling off camera as Candy delivered it. And yet for whatever reason, it was chopped down to a line or two. He reads a bit of it and starts to cry.There’s more, but if that sounds intriguing, you should really just watch it. Neville has said it doesn’t matter which order. And what does it add up to? On a certain level he’s still an enigma. It’s hard for mere mortals to comprehend a half century of otherworldly fame, but it’s also just nice to watch a familiar face reflect on how he has, at 78, finally found happiness. Besides, Steve Martin’s story is not even remotely finished. These are just two parts.“STEVE!

Mark Kennedy,"Do you reckon Sasquatches snore? C’mon, you know the answer, deep down. Of course, they do. They snore and eat noisily and pick bugs out of each other’s fur and then eat those bugs, noisily.What else do Sasquatches do, you wonder? One of the wildest movies of the year — or the century, for that matter — suggests they mourn, cuddle, bury their dead, enjoy throwing rocks in rivers, make art and wonder if they’re alone in the world.Even so, “Sasquatch Sunset” from filmmaking brothers David and Nathan Zellner, is a bewildering 90-minute, narrator-less and wordless experiment that’s as audacious as it is infuriating. It’s not clear if everyone was high making it or we should be while watching it.Nathan Zellner, Jesse Eisenberg,Riley Keough and Christophe Zajac-Denek play a makeshift family of four Sasquatches, lost in hair suits and prosthetics and communicating only in grunts, snorts and howls. They also pee a lot.Why the filmmakers hired such starry actors instead of paying scale to some unknowns is puzzling. None of the Sasquatches do more than what could be called Method Chimpanzee — jumping up and down, whooping and growling. A group of real chimps would ding the quartet for overacting.As an exercise in creating empathy for monsters, “Sasquatch Sunset” does an admirable job. In the first frames, when we see a loping Bigfoot in the middle distance — and then three more — it’s clear that they are telling this story, not the folks who usually capture them in shaky camera frames.There are plenty of Sasquatches-are-just-like-us moments, like when one brings flowers to seduce another or two Bigfoots comfort each other after a death. Perhaps the most poignant moments are when they pound trees with sticks in unison, a rhythmic question that echoes through the valley. It’s a call, waiting for a response — anyone out there like us?But then there’s a lot of gross-out stuff. We’ve mentioned the peeing, but it turns out that Sasquatches sneeze, procreate loudly and like to touch their genitals and then smell their fingers. They can also poo on demand and throw that poo to scare off predators.One juvenile Bigfoot makes his hand into a makeshift puppet and talks to it — like a nod to the kid in “The Shining” — and another considers inserting his manhood into a small tree hole, like a prehistoric riff off that famous scene in “American Pie.”Both things can be true, of course: Bigfoot can be disgusting and deep at the same time. But it’s not always clear what the filmmakers are going for here — satire, metaphor, sympathy, naturalism or gross-out comedy?The Sasquatches reveal deeply human characteristics and may be stand-ins for our innocent pasts, a lost link in our evolution, showing the unrelenting violence of natural life or just the voiceless among us now. Or the filmmakers might just like the image of tossing poo.Gorgeous vistas of pristine forests and misty valleys don’t help us figuring out when this all takes place but gradual clues emerge, including evidence of logging and a truly surreal bit at a human camping site, scored by the Erasure song “Love to Hate You.” But if the Zellners had an environmental lesson here, they shanked it.There’s great music from The Octopus Project, veering from bright electric guitar noodles to sci-fi electronic dread reminiscent of “2001: A Space Odyssey.” Stick through the roll of end credits and see one of the best credits ever in film: Sasquatch Wrangler. You don’t see that every day. You don’t see Sasquatch movies every day, either, but this is one you should probably let lope past you.“Sasquatch Sunset,” a Bleecker Street release that lands in some theaters on April 12 and goes wider April 19, is rated R for “for some sexual content, full nudity and bloody images.” Running time: 89 minutes.

Jake Coyle,"When we talk about “movie magic,” the first thing that comes to mind is often something like the bikes achieving liftoff in “E.T.” But it applies no less to Alice Rohrwacher’s wondrous “La Chimera,” a grubbily transcendent folk tale of a film that finds its enchantment buried in the ground.“Were you dreaming?” a train conductor asks the sleeping Arthur (Josh O’Connor), a distant, temperamental Brit in Italy with little more to his name than the rumpled cream-colored linen suit he wears. The answer is yes. Radiant memories of Arthur’s dead lover, Benjamina, haunt his dreams and propel him on a strange quest into the underground tombs of Tuscany.A melancholy spell seems to hang over Arthur, who has a mystical gift for finding ancient relics. It’s the early 1980s. Arthur is returning home from a stint in jail for grave robbing. His homecoming is received like a hero’s return by the scruffy, carnivalesque band of tombaroli — tomb raiders who plunder Etruscan artifacts — who look on Arthur more like a prince than a destitute thief. They call him “maestro.”With remarkable precision, Arthur is able to point to where to dig. In one scene, he takes a small, bended branch as an instrument for his dowsing. “La Chimera,” itself, seems to emerge almost the same way — an earthy, spellbinding buried treasure with a sublime drawing power.The precise moment I fell totally in love with “La Chimera” — and this is very much a movie to love — is an early montage in which Arthur and his fellow scavengers scamper across the countryside, hiding in fields from bumbling police, while a folk song about the tombarolo Englishman is sung. “La Chimera,” the third in a loose trilogy for Rohrwacher following “The Wonders” and “Happy as Lazzaro,” is the fullest realization yet of her cinema of “magical neo-realism.”Rohrwacher’s great fascination is with the past. The hold it can have on the present. The vast yet minuscule distance between long-ago and today. “Happy as Lazzaro” charmingly walked a 19th century peasant into present day.“La Chimera” is even more beguiling and mournful. The tombaroli make a merry band, but Arthur’s plight is shadowed by death. “He was looking for a passage to the afterlife,” one of his companions says in the film, one of a handful of direct addresses. (Rohrwacher, a devotee of Italian folk tales, spins her films like a playful narrator in an old fairy tale. She’s among the most thrillingly original filmmakers working today.)Arthur and company make cash by selling their unearthed Etruscan wares. But he’s driven less by money than a compulsion to reach the dead, to reach Benjamina. How deep will he dig? Will the darkness of the underworld envelop him?Arthur also makes occasional visits to the mother of Benjamina, Flora (a typically magnificent Isabella Rossellini ), who, like him, has not yet accepted the death of her daughter. She receives him courteously and deferentially, with an old-world manner. Flora’s other daughters snicker that she only lets men smoke in the house.At her crumbling villa, Arthur meets Italia (Carol Duarte, fabulous), a singing student who, Flora says, is tone deaf. But she might be the sharpest observer in the film. Italia, alone, is horrified by the plundering of the graves. In other ways, she’s the embodiment of the time the tombs recall. It’s noted that the Etruscans elevated women in society — one of, though not the only, relic of the past that “La Chimera” brings forward to today.Past and present mingle in mysterious ways in “La Chimera.” The greatest Etruscan discovery — a glorious subterranean chamber — is made on a beach with a factory just down the shoreline. But the even more remarkable excavation of the film is of Arthur’s grieving soul. O’Connor is exquisite in a role that requires the deftest balance of tangible reality and otherworldly fable.Like so many things in “La Chimera,” O’Connor’s performance is entrancing and confounding. How can a movie be so nimbly poised between past and present, you can’t help but wonder. The stuff of fairy tales — of a kind of storytelling magic — is what Rohrwacher, herself, wants to unearth. “Were you dreaming?” Good question.“La Chimera,” a Neon release, is not rated by the Motion Picture Association. In Italian with English subtitles. Running time: 133 minutes. Four stars out of four.",2024-03-27 22:04:23 PM EEST,NPR,Movie Review: Alice Rohrwacher’s tombaroli tale ‘La Chimera’ is pure magic,https://apnews.com/article/la-chimera-movie-review-josh-oconnor-alice-rohrwacher-f133cf3688f7d6ccdf171750b11cbdc9

Lindsey Bahr,"The United States is crumbling in Alex Garland’s sharp new film “ Civil War, ” a bellowing and haunting big screen experience. The country has been at war with itself for years by the time we’re invited in, through the gaze of a few journalists documenting the chaos on the front lines and chasing an impossible interview with the president.Garland, the writer-director of films like “Annihilation” and “Ex Machina,” as well as the series “Devs,” always seems to have an eye on the ugliest sides of humanity and our capacity for self-destruction. His themes are profound and his exploration of them sincere in films that are imbued with strange and haunting images that rattle around in your subconscious for far too long. Whatever you think of “ Men,” his most divisive film to date, it’s unlikely anyone will forget Rory Kinnear giving birth to himself.In “Civil War,” starring Kirsten Dunst as a veteran war photographer named Lee, Garland is challenging his audience once again by not making the film about what everyone thinks it will, or should, be about. Yes, it’s a politically divided country. Yes, the President (Nick Offerman) is a blustery, rising despot who has given himself a third term, taken to attacking his citizens and shut himself off from the press. Yes, there is one terrifying character played by Jesse Plemons who has some pretty hard lines about who is and isn’t a real American.But that trailer that had everyone talking is not the story. Garland is not so dull or narratively conservative to make the film about red and blue ideologies. All we really know is that the so-called Western Forces of Texas and California have seceded from the country and are closing in to overthrow the government. We don’t know what they want or why, or what the other side wants or why and you start to realize that many of the characters don’t seem to really know, or care, either.This choice might be frustrating to some audiences, but it’s also the only one that makes sense in a film focused on the kinds of journalists who put themselves in harm’s way to tell the story of violent conflicts and unrest. As Lee explains to Cailee Spaeny’s Jessie, a young, aspiring photographer who has elbowed her way onto their dangerous journey to Washington, questions are not for her to ask: She takes truthful, impartial pictures so that everyone else can.“Civil War” a film that is more about war reporters than anything else — the trauma of the beat, the vital importance of bearing witness and the moral and ethical dilemmas of impartiality. Dunst’s Lee is having a bit of an existential crisis, having shot so many horrors and feeling as though she hasn’t made any difference — violence and death are still everywhere. She’s also a pro: Hardened and committed to the story and the image. Her colleague Joel (Wagner Moura) is more of an adrenaline junkie, chasing the gunfire and drinking himself into a stupor every night. There’s Jessie (Spaeny), the wide-eyed but ambitious newbie who is in over her head, and the aging editor Sammy (the great Stephen McKinley Henderson), wise and buttoned up in Brooks Brothers and suspenders, who can’t imagine a life outside of news even as his body is failing him. All are self-motivated and none of them have a life outside of the job, which might be a criticism for some movie characters but not here (trigger warning for any journo audiences out there).The group must drive an indirect route to get from New York to Washington as safely as possible, through Pittsburgh and West Virginia. The roads and towns are set-dressed a little bit, but anyone who knows the area will recognize familiar sights of dead malls, creaky off-brand gas stations on two lane roads, boarded up shops and overgrown parking lots that all work to provide an unsettlingly effective backdrop for the bleak world of “Civil War.”Dunst and Spaeny are both exceedingly good in their roles, effectively embodying the veteran and the novice — a well-written, nuanced and evolving dynamic that should inspire post-credits debates and discussion (among other topics).Dread permeates every frame, whether it’s a quiet moment of smart conversation, a white-knuckle standoff or a deafening shootout on 17th street.

It’s a full body theatrical experience that deserves a chance.“Civil War,” an A24 release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for “strong, violent content, bloody/disturbing images and language throughout.” Running time: 119 minutes.

Jake Coyle,"Has there been a more satisfying actor to watch mature on screen in recent years than Dev Patel? The endearingly earnest, scrawny kid of “Slumdog Millionaire” has steadily grown into a singularly intense and sensitive leading man. It’s a transformation that, for anyone who missed “Lion,”“The Personal History of David Copperfield” or “The Green Knight,” may be especially jarring in watching Patel’s new film, “Monkey Man.”Like “Slumdog Millionaire,” the film is set in Mumbai and has a touch of fable to it. But in tone and texture, it could hardly be more different. Bathed in blood and fury, “Monkey Man” is one gory coming out party for Patel, who also directed and co-wrote the film. He kicks so much butt in this movie — at one point he punches a punch — that it’s enough to make you wonder if the search for the new James Bond ought to be redirected.“Monkey Man,” produced by Jordan Peele, is aiming for something grittier, though — more in Bruce Lee territory or the neighborhood of Park Chan-wook’s “Oldboy” — wild, kinetic places to be where martial-arts action turns mythic and feverish. At its best moments, “Monkey Man” does that tradition justice. But at all its moments, the movie is a convincing display of Patel’s still-expanding power and tenacity as a performer.“Monkey Man” is most explosive in its blistering first half-hour. Patel’s character, credited only as Kid, fights while wearing a gorilla mask in an underground boxing ring. Our first image of him is of his head, in that mask, hitting the canvas hard.These scenes, presided over by Sharlto Copley’s ring leader, have a masochist edge to them, as does Kid’s corresponding efforts to get closer to a den of power and corruption housed in the high-rise King’s Club. We don’t know initially the reasons for his obsession; he’s a mysterious, single-minded figure compelled by hellbent revenge.And we watch with curiosity as he works his way into the building as a dishwasher hired by manager Queenie (Ashwini Kalsekar) and, soon thereafter, gains a promotion to waiter to get himself up to the penthouse. His focus is on the police chief Rana (Sikandar Kher) and the build-up to their brutal first encounter is a swiftly edited, kinetic swirl. It fails, sending Kid on a clattering cascade down the building and beyond. Out of the frying pan, into the prostitution den with the ax-wielding maniac.But while “Monkey Man” is thrillingly enigmatic at first, it’s overly leaden with exposition once it settles in. To its credit, the movie has other things on its mind. It opens with the Hindu epic poem “Ramayana,” in which the deity Hanuman mistakes the sun for a mango and has his powers stripped.“Monkey Man” is sketched symbolically against the story of Hanuman but set in a sordid, contemporary Mumbai (technically it’s a fictional city named Yatana). The syndicate Kid is trying to infiltrate ultimately leads to a religious leader (Makarand Deshpande). “Monkey Man,” which Netflix dropped before it was picked up by Peele and Universal, is pointedly political in its fictionalized echoes of modern, Modi-led India.While Kid recovers with the help of the sage Alpha (Vipin Sharma) and a group of transgender women in hiding, these elements are slowly brought from a simmer to a boil. “Monkey Man” makes room for cutaways to TV news reports (some footage comes from real demonstrations) and copious flashbacks to a violent land grab from Kid’s childhood, during which his mother Neela (Adithi Kalkunte) was brutally murdered.The real-world metaphors and Hindu contexts of “Monkey Man” add to the film’s potency but aren’t always smoothly incorporated. This is a movie that namechecks “John Wick,” too. And it’s more successful in its frenetic fight choreography leading up to a bloody third-act showdown imbued with the rage of class uprising.But regardless of any incongruities, “Monkey Man” makes for a forceful directorial debut from Patel. More than anything else, he brings a compelling gravity to a film that is quite serious about getting seriously brutal.“Monkey Man,” a Universal Pictures release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for strong bloody violence throughout, language throughout, sexual content/nudity and drug use. Running time: 121 minutes.

Mike Stobbe,"NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. births fell last year, resuming a long national slide.A little under 3.6 million babies were born in 2023, according to provisional statistics released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s about 76,000 fewer than the year before and the lowest one-year tally since 1979.U.S. births were slipping for more than a decade before COVID-19 hit, then dropped 4% from 2019 to 2020. They ticked up for two straight years after that, an increase experts attributed, in part, to pregnancies that couples had put off amid the pandemic’s early days.But “the 2023 numbers seem to indicate that bump is over and we’re back to the trends we were in before,” said Nicholas Mark, a University of Wisconsin researcher who studies how social policy and other factors influence health and fertility.Birth rates have long been falling for teenagers and younger women, but rising for women in their 30s and 40s — a reflection of women pursuing education and careers before trying to start families, experts say. But last year, birth rates fell for all women younger than 40, and were flat for women in their 40s.Mark called that development surprising and said “there’s some evidence that not just postponement is going on.”Rates fell across almost all racial and ethnic groups.The numbers released Thursday are based on more than 99.9% of the birth certificates filed in 2023, but they are provisional and the final birth count can change as they are finalized. For example, the provisional 2022 birth count appeared to show a dip, but ended up being higher than 2021’s tally when the analysis was completed.There could be an adjustment to the 2023 data, but it won’t be enough to erase the “sizeable” decline seen in the provisional numbers, said the CDC’s Brady Hamilton, the new report’s first author.Experts have wondered how births might be affected by the June 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision that allowed states to ban or restrict abortion. Experts estimate that nearly half of pregnancies are unintended, so limits to abortion access could affect the number of births.The new report indicates that the decision didn’t lead to a national increase in births, but the researchers didn’t analyze birth trends in individual states or dissect data among all demographic groups.The new data does raise the possibility of an impact on teens. The U.S. teen birth rate has been falling decades, but the decline has been less dramatic in recent years, and the drop seems to have stopped for teen girls ages 15 to 17.“That could be Dobbs,” said Dr. John Santelli, a Columbia University professor of population and family health and pediatrics. Or it could be related to changes in sex education or access to contraception, he added.Whatever the case, the flattening of birth rates for high school students is worrisome and indicates that “whatever we’re doing for kids in middle and high school is faltering,” Santelli said.More findings from the report:—From 2022 to 2023, the provisional number of births fell 5% for American Indian and Alaska Native women, 4% for Black women, 3% for white women and 2% for Asian American women. Births rose 1% for Hispanic women.—The percentage of babies born preterm held about steady.—The cesarean section birth rate rose again, to 32.4% of births. Some experts worry that C-sections are done more often than medically necessary.—The U.S. was once among only a few developed countries with a fertility rate that ensured each generation had enough children to replace itself — about 2.1 kids per woman. But it’s been sliding, and in 2023 dropped to about 1.6, the lowest rate on record.Surveys suggest many U.S. couples would prefer to have two or more kids but see housing, job security and the cost of child care as significant obstacles to having more children.“There’s something getting in the way of them being able to achieve those goals,” Mark said.The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Mark Kennedy,"If you always thought your garden-variety heist movies could do with a bit more blood-sucking vampire, have we got a flick for you.“Abigail,” featuring a 12-year-old tutu-wearing member of the undead, is way better than it should be, a gleeful genre-smashing romp through puddles of gore.Directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett and producer Chad Villella — part of Radio Silence Productions — have cracked the modern horror code with such hits as “Ready or Not,” “Scream” and “Scream VI.” They do not disappoint with “Abigail,” even perhaps opening a new, bloody revenue stream. (And wait for the phone call scene, a nod to “Scream.”)“Abigail” starts with an odd assortment of mercenaries — played by “Scream” veteran Melissa Barrera, “Downton Abbey” star Dan Stevens, Kathryn Newton, Kevin Durand, William Catlett and the late Angus Cloud.The six — representing the muscle, sniper, computer expert, getaway driver, medic etc — are hired to kidnap a rich preteen (nicknamed “Tiny Dancer”) and hold her for ransom. The rules are: No names. No backstory. No grabass, which is a weird request, if we’re being honest. All this group needs to do is detain the target for 24 hours until rich dad pays $50 million in ransom.Why are six professional underworld characters needed to snatch and detain a sweet preteen, still wearing her tutu? That’s easy: Not all of them are going to survive to claim their share of $7 million. That’s because Abigail (Alisha Weir, awesome, stay away from me, no seriously) is really into, well, neckwork.“I’m sorry about what’s going to happen to you,” Abigail sweetly tells the kidnappers. We have some idea — and it’s going to be great. Suddenly, the rambling estate they’re holding her becomes a prison. The tables are turned.The script written by Stephen Shields (“The Hole in the Ground”) and regular Radio Silence collaborator Guy Busick (“Ready or Not” and the “Scream” movies) — gleefully mines humor in the horror. Laughing a moment after a body fully explodes is normal here.“This whole thing is a trip,” says one of the gang. Believe them. “Something doesn’t add up,” says another. Believe that guy, too.Garlic, sunlight, spears and crucifixes are employed to try to stop Abigail, who has hijacked the heist movie and turned it into a run-for-your-life thriller. She’s a very smart 12-year-old who turns hardened mercenaries against each other.Barrera, who had been so central to the life of the “Scream” franchise, shows why she’s so good at horror — funny, sarcastic, vulnerable, athletic, soulful and very convincing with a stake in her hand.Stevens, who famously left the aristocratic “Downton Abbey” for better roles, may wonder what he’s doing here now, bathed in blood fighting a preteen vampire, but does an admirable job, definitely in on the camp.But it’s Weir in the titular role who carries it, doing pirouettes and leaps as she chases the bad-guys-now-good guys to the theme of “Swan Lake” with blood dripping down her throat, rotten teeth and feathers in her hair. “I like to play with my food,” she says.Run faster!“Abigail,” a Universal Pictures release that hits theaters Friday, is rated R for “strong bloody violence and gore throughout, pervasive language and brief drug use.” Running time: 110 minutes.

Juan A. Lozano,"HOUSTON (AP) — A judge has declined to dismiss hundreds of lawsuits filed against rap star Travis Scott over his role in the deadly 2021 Astroworld festival in which 10 people were killed in a crowd surge.State District Judge Kristen Hawkins issued a one-page order denying Scott’s request that he and his touring and production company, XX Global, should be dropped from the case. The order was signed on Tuesday but made public on Wednesday.Scott’s attorneys had argued during an April 15 hearing that he was not responsible for safety planning and watching for possible dangers at the concert on Nov. 5, 2021.They argued Scott’s duties and responsibilities related to the festival only dealt with creative aspects, including performing and marketing.However, Noah Wexler, an attorney for the family of Madison Dubiski, 23, one of the 10 people killed, said Scott, whose real name is Jacques Bermon Webster II, had a “conscious disregard for safety” at the sold-out festival. Wexler argued Scott encouraged people who didn’t have tickets to break in and ignored orders from festival organizers to stop the concert when told to do so as people in the crowd were hurt or dying.Earlier this month, Hawkins dismissed lawsuits against Drake and several other individuals and companies involved in the show.The lawsuit filed by Dubiski’s family is set to be the first one to go to trial on May 6.The families of the 10 people who died, plus hundreds who were injured, sued Scott and Live Nation — the festival’s promoter — as well as dozens of other individuals and entities.After an investigation by Houston police, no charges were filed against Scott, and a grand jury declined to indict him and five other people on any criminal counts related to the deadly concert.Those killed, who ranged in age from 9 to 27, died from compression asphyxia, which an expert likened to being crushed by a car.Some of the lawsuits filed by the families of the dead and the hundreds who were injured have been settled, including those filed by the families of four of the dead.Follow Juan A.

Lindsey Bahr,"“ Barbenheimer ” is a hard act to follow. But as Hollywood enters another summer movie season, armed with fewer superheroes and a landscape vastly altered by the strikes, it’s worth remembering the classic William Goldman quote about what works: “Nobody knows anything.”Four decades later, that still may be true. Yet one thing Hollywood has learned in releasing films through the pandemic and the strikes is how to pivot quickly.The summer of 2023 brought a new enthusiasm for moviegoing, with the fortuitous counterprogramming of “Barbie” and “ Oppenheimer,” and surprise hits like “ Sound of Freedom,” helping the season’s box office crack $4 billion for the first time since 2019. But before the industry could take a victory lap, there was another crisis looming with the dual Hollywood strikes, which shuttered most productions for months.In the fallout, theaters lost big summer titles like “Mission: Impossible 8,” “Captain America: Brave New World” and “Thunderbolts” to 2025. But they gained a gem in Jeff Nichols’ “The Bikeriders” (June 21), about a 1960s Midwestern motorcycle club, as studios moved films around on the summer chessboard. “Deadpool & Wolverine,” once set to kick off the summer moviegoing season on May 3 like many Marvel movies before it, is now sitting happily on July 26, patiently waiting to dominate the summer charts.“I do love being right there in the belly of summer,” said director Shawn Levy. “That’s a juicy moment.”The kickoff weekend instead belongs to an original film about a different kind of superhero. “ The Fall Guy,” starring Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt, is part romantic-comedy, part action-comedy, and all love letter to the stunt performers that make movies spectacular. It’s an earnest crowd-pleaser that could jumpstart a season that feels, in some ways, like a throwback, with full-throttle spectacles (“Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,” “Twisters”), comedies (“Babes”), IMAX wonder (“The Blue Angels”) and even a Kevin Costner Western.Producer Jerry Bruckheimer has seen the highs and lows of summer movies over the decades, with blockbusters including “ Top Gun: Maverick ” and the “Pirates of the Caribbean” movies.This season, he has three very different offerings on the calendar, two are fourth installments in popular franchises — “Beverly Hills Cop” (July 3, Netflix) and “Bad Boys” (June 7, theaters) — and one was planned for streaming but tested so well that it’s getting a theatrical rollout (“Young Woman and the Sea,” May 31).“People just want to be entertained,” Bruckheimer said. “It really comes down to us to make the right movies that they want to go see.”A Hollywood summer lasts 123 days from the first Friday in May through Labor Day Monday in September. Pre-pandemic, $4 billion was a normal summer intake and theaters could count on anywhere between 37 and 42 films to open on over 2,000 screens. The outlier was 2017, which had only 35 movies on over 2,000 screens and topped out at $3.8 billion. It makes last summer’s $4 billion haul with 32 wide releases (45% of the $9 billion domestic haul) even more impressive.This summer should have 32 wide releases as well and over 40 movies opening in 500+ theaters. Notably only two of them are Marvel movies (“Deadpool” and Sony’s “Kraven the Hunter”) and are the only superhero movies on the calendar until the “Joker” sequel in the fall.“People are going to see movies, not box office, and it looks like a really solid summer from a moviegoer’s perspective,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore.“The Bikeriders” was one that planned for an awards season rollout, with a turbo boost from stellar reviews out of the Telluride Film Festival hailing star turns for Austin Butler and Jodie Comer. But as they inched closer to its release date it became clear that the strikes were not going to resolve in time for a press tour.“It was kind of like walking on frozen glass for three months,” Nichols said. “I was touring around doing press and trying to build this energy on my own. Let me tell you, it’s not the same as Austin Butler.”Later in June, after a splashy Cannes debut, Kevin Costner will begin rolling out his two-part Western epic “Horizon: An American Saga,” set during the Civil War. And as always there are a slew of Sundance breakouts peppered throughout the summer, from Jane Shoenbrun’s “I Saw the TV Glow” and “Didi” to “ Thelma ” and “Good One.”Family films often go into hyperdrive in the summer, capitalizing on long days out of school. This year has plenty, like “The Garfield Movie” and “Despicable Me 4,” re-releases of Studio Ghibli classics, and streaming options (“Thelma the Unicorn”). But perhaps none has more anticipation behind it than “Inside Out 2” (June 14, theaters), which meets up with Riley as she enters her teenage years as a new group of emotions crash Joy’s party, including Anxiety, Envy, Ennui and Embarrassment.“That age gives us everything we need and love for a Pixar film,” director Kelsey Mann said. “It’s full of drama, it has potential for a lot of heart, and I could also make it really funny.”John Krasinski is also delving into the inner world of children with his ambitious live-action hybrid “IF” (May 17, theaters) about the imaginary friends that get left behind and two humans (Ryan Reynolds and Cailey Fleming) who can still see them.Audiences seeking the adrenaline rush of horrors and thrillers have plenty of choices, including “MaXXXine,” the conclusion to Ti West’s accidental Mia Goth trilogy (“X” and “ Pearl ”) that debuts around the fourth of July.Goth’s aspiring actress has made her way to Hollywood where a killer is stalking Hollywood starlets around the time of the home video boom of the 1980s.“We recreated the sleazy side of Hollywood in a hopefully charming way,” West said. “It’s definitely a pretty wild night at the movies. A big, rockin’, fun movie.”On June 26, audiences can also delve into the beginnings of “A Quiet Place” with a prequel set on “Day One” starring Luptia Nyong’o and “Stranger Things’” Joseph Quinn. Director Michael Sarnoski said they wanted to explore the “scope and promise” of a Quiet Place movie in New York. Later, Fede Álvarez brings his horror acumen to “Alien: Romulus” (Aug. 16), set between the first two.M. Night Shyamalan is back as well with a thriller set at a pop concert (“Trap,” Aug. 9) and his daughter, Ishana Night Shyamalan, makes her directorial debut with the spooky, Ireland-set “The Watchers” (June 14) with Dakota Fanning.“It’s very suspenseful and unexpected,” Ishana said. “And it’s very much built for the experience of being in a theater.”Much to the chagrin of theater owners, big summer movies have also existed off the big screen for years now. And the streamers have movie stars and spectacle with the festival favorite “Hit Man,” the Anne Hathaway romance “The Idea of You,” Jerry Seinfeld’s starry pop-tart movie “Unfrosted” and a Mark Wahlberg/Halle Berry action comedy “The Union.”They have franchises too: “Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F” (July 3) was a movie that was in and out of development since the mid-1990s, but got new life when Paramount licensed the rights to Netflix.“We raised our hand to make sure we got the franchise right and kept the integrity and fun of the original,” Bruckheimer said.This installment adds an emotional component in which Eddie Murphy’s Axel Foley reunites with his estranged daughter (Taylour Paige). It also sees the return of Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, Paul Reiser and Bronson Pinchot and adds Kevin Bacon and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.On Aug. 9, Apple TV+ will also have “The Instigators,” a new action-comedy starring Matt Damon and Casey Affleck as normal guys attempting a heist. “Midnight Run” was one of their touchstones.“The script was so funny and I wanted to really embrace that,” Doug Liman, who directed, said.Remember, anything can happen with summer movies.We can pretend we knew that “Barbie” would be the biggest movie of the year, but would anyone have bet that an R-rated drama about the father of the atomic bomb would have made almost three times as much as Harrison Ford’s last ride as Indiana Jones? Or that a $14 million crowdfunded movie from a new studio about child trafficking with next to zero promotion would earn over $250 million?“Nobody knows anything is right,” said “The Instigators” producer Kevin Walsh. “The movie business is so unpredictable. You never know what’s going to work and what isn’t. But you have your taste. And following your taste and your instincts in this business is paramount.”For interviews, reviews and more coverage of recent film releases, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/movies",2024-04-24 17:13:23 PM EEST,NPR,"The summer after Barbenheimer and the strikes, Hollywood charts a new course",https://apnews.com/article/2024-summer-movie-preview-dd4640580b4d32cb235996eb69665ea9
None,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Oracle Corp.'s planned campus in Nashville, Tennessee, will serve as the business software giant’s world headquarters, placing it in a city that’s a center for the U.S. health care industry, company Chairman Larry Ellison said.Ellison spoke about Oracle’s plans for its Nashville offices during a conversation about health care technology with former U.S. Sen. Bill Frist at the Oracle Health Summit on Tuesday.In 2021, a Tennessee panel approved $65 million in state incentives for Oracle, with the company planning to bring 8,500 jobs and an investment topping $1 billion to Nashville over a decade. Then-Mayor John Cooper’s office announced that the company, currently based in Austin, Texas, planned to build the new campus with 1.2 million square feet (111,400 square meters) of office space. In 2020, Oracle announced it was moving its headquarters from its longtime home in Redwood City, California, to Texas.Frist, a doctor and businessman, asked Ellison why Nashville was chosen. Ellison, whose company bought electronic medical records company Cerner in 2022, called the city “a health center.”“We’re moving this huge campus, which will ultimately be our world headquarters,” Ellison said. “We’re moving that to Nashville.”Ellison then joked that he “shouldn’t have said that.”According to the Nashville Health Care Council, Tennessee’s capital city has more than 900 companies with 550,000 employees working in the health care industry. HCA Healthcare and Change Healthcare are among the large companies based in the growing city.Ellison, who is also the company’s chief technology officer, said Oracle wants to be part of a community where people want to live. He said the city “ticked all the boxes” in employee surveys.“Nashville is a fabulous place to live,” Ellison said. “It’s a great place to raise a family. It’s got a unique and vibrant culture .... It’s the center of the industry we’re most concerned about, which is the health care industry.”The Nashville mayor’s office said in 2021 that Oracle paid $254 million for 60 acres (24 hectares) in downtown Nashville and offered $175 million upfront for public infrastructure, including a pedestrian bridge over the Cumberland River, environmental cleanup, a sewer pump station and a riverfront park.Ellison said plans for the riverfront campus include a community clinic, a concert venue, a hotel and a restaurant.Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell said his office has been actively engaged with Oracle since he was elected last year, “and it’s been clear that they intended to enhance the level of activity at their River North campus.”“We are a complete city that also checks the box for business,” O’Connell said in a statement.This story has been updated to correct that Ellison is Oracle’s chairman, not CEO.",2024-04-25 00:24:09 AM EEST,NPR,Oracle’s Larry Ellison says planned Nashville campus will be company’s ‘world headquarters’,https://apnews.com/article/oracle-larry-ellison-nashville-headquarters-health-care-cf74172176f6c90210e8ac96e1ff6f52

Fatima Hussein,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The big U.S. aid package for Ukraine and other allies that President Joe Biden signed Wednesday also allows the administration to seize Russian state assets located in the U.S. and use them for the benefit of Kyiv.That could mean another $5 billion in assistance for Ukraine, coming from Russian Central Bank holdings that have already been frozen in the United States. The seizures would be carried out under provisions of the REPO Act, short for the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity for Ukrainians Act, that were incorporated into the aid bill.But it’s not likely the U.S. will seize the assets without agreement from other members of the Group of Seven nations and the European Union.The U.S. and its allies immediately froze $300 billion in Russian foreign holdings at the start of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. That money has been sitting untapped — most of it in European Union nations — as the war grinds on. But roughly $5 billion of it is located in the U.S.The frozen assets are immobilized and can’t be accessed by Moscow — but they still belong to Russia. While governments can generally freeze property without difficulty, turning that property into forfeited assets that can be sold for the benefit of Ukraine requires an extra layer of judicial procedure, including a legal basis and adjudication in a court.For more than a year, officials from multiple countries have debated the legality of confiscating the money and sending it to Ukraine.The new U.S. law requires the president and Treasury Department to start locating Russian assets in the U.S. within 90 days and to report back to Congress within 180 days. A month after that period, the president will be allowed to “seize, confiscate, transfer, or vest” any Russian state sovereign assets, including any interest, within U.S. jurisdictions.But the U.S. wants to keep consulting with global allies and act together, which is likely to slow down the process.National security adviser Jake Sullivan said Wednesday the issue would be an important topic when leaders of the G7 countries meet in Italy in June, adding that “the ideal is that we all move together.”Biden is given leeway to determine how the money can be spent for the benefit of Ukraine — but he must confer with other G7 members before acting.The legislation states that “any effort by the United States to confiscate and repurpose Russian sovereign assets” should be done alongside international allies, including the G7, the 27-member European Union and other nations as part of a coordinated effort.Policymakers, including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, have said the U.S. is not likely to act without the support of G7 allies.Yellen said after the passage of the bill that “Congress took an important step in that effort with the passage of the REPO Act, and I will continue intensive discussions with our G7 partners in the weeks ahead on a collective path forward,” Yellen said.The European Union already has begun to set aside windfall profits generated from frozen Russian central bank assets. The bloc estimates the interest on that money could provide around 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) each year.“The Russians will not be very happy. The amount of money, 3 billion per year, is not extraordinary, but it is not negligible,” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told reporters in March.Still, some European leaders have expressed hesitation about moving forward with a plan to formally seize Russia’s assets in Europe.European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said at a Council on Foreign Relations event earlier this month that confiscating Russian assets “is something that needs to be looked at very carefully” and could “start breaking the international legal order.”Critics of the REPO Act say the weaponization of global finance against Russia could harm the U.S. dollar’s standing as the world’s dominant currency.To confiscate Russia’s assets could prompt nations like China — the biggest holder of U.S. Treasuries — to determine it is not safe to keep their reserves in U.S. dollars.The conservative Heritage Foundation has criticized Russian asset seizure for, among other things, undermining the dollar-denominated global finance system, saying “it would expose an already fragile economy to unintended consequences and risks for which the United States is unprepared.”Russian authorities have warned that the new law will undermine the global financial system.",2024-04-24 23:05:06 PM EEST,NPR,The US is now allowed to seize Russian state assets.

The union’s board rejected a lower offer last summer, and flight attendants voted against a second proposal in December.Southwest has about 20,000 flight attendants. They will get raises of more than 22% on May 1 and annual increases of 3% in each of the following three years.The union said the contract provides record gains for flight attendants and sets a standard for other flight attendants. Cabin crews at United Airlines and American Airlines, which are represented by other unions, are still negotiating contracts.The union said the deal gives Southwest crews the shortest on-duty day and highest pay in the industry, compensation during disruptions like the Southwest meltdown in December 2022, and industry-first paid maternity and parental leave. Workers will also split $364 million in ratification bonuses, according to the union.Dallas-based Southwest, the nation’s fourth-biggest airline, said the contract includes changes in scheduling and will help the airline’s operation.Pilot unions at Delta, United, American and Southwest approved contracts last year that raised pay by more than one-third over several years.

Kiana Doyle,"Once upon a time, on Pet Shop Boys ' first single, “West End Girls,” vocalist Neil Tennant sang the lines, “We’ve got no future / We’ve got no past / Here today, built to last.”Fifteen studio records later, there possibly isn’t a better verse that captures the timelessness of the stone-faced British pop duo that appears to, indeed, be built to last.Known for their synthesizer-backed dance tracks with emotionally resonant lyrics, Tennant and keyboardist Chris Lowe created their own style of electric pop — influenced by glam rock and disco — that has stood the test of time with consistent releases over the years. Their latest album, “Nonetheless,” falls right in line with the pattern.Tennant’s simple-sounding vocals tell stories of loneliness, longing and love, elevated by bumping electronic beats and orchestral harmonies in this bittersweet masterpiece. Lowe’s synthesizer skills bring each track to life, as always, and the dichotomy between heart-wrenching lyrics and dance-inducing instrumentals is a poignant reflection of human emotion.Catchy track “Why am I dancing?” is a perfect example. Head-bopping beats and triumphant trumpets and strings accompany the lyrics, “Why am I dancing when I’m so alone? / Maybe I can celebrate on my own.”Nostalgia for another time and place seeps throughout “Nonetheless.” Tennant reflects on starting out on his own in “New London boy,” and he yearns for a feeling just out of reach in “A new bohemia.”“The secret of happiness” feels like falling in love in an old Hollywood movie with a sweeping orchestral arrangement, while final track “Love is the law” takes a more ominous turn with lyrics describing the feeling such as: “It waits and watches / Weaves and dodges / Catch it like a cold / No one is immune.”Packed with gems, “Nonetheless” is sure to delight both old and new fans and shows that the duo isn’t slowing down any time soon.",2024-04-24 18:34:29 PM EEST,NPR,Music Review: Pet Shop Boys have done it yet again with catchy and bittersweet ‘Nonetheless’,https://apnews.com/article/pet-shop-boys-nonetheless-review-1754d921eb06a65d9e6945fad5c04e77
Alicia Rancilio,"At 78, John Lithgow’s acting career is not slowing down. He appeared in the best picture nominee “Killers of the Flower Moon” and starred with Jeff Bridges in the FX series “The Old Man.” Recently, the two-time Academy Award nominee and multiple Emmy, Tony and Golden Globes-winning actor played the new kid in school. He learned dance, ceramics, silk-screen printing and vocal jazz ensemble with Los Angeles-area high school students. It was filmed for “Art Happens Here with John Lithgow,” airing Friday on PBS with the goal of promoting arts education.Lithgow, who has an undergraduate degree from Harvard and was a Fulbright Scholar at the London School of the Arts, spoke with The Associated Press about going back to school.Answers have been edited for clarity and brevity.LITHGOW: You’ve got to get kids excited about learning and eager to get to school. If there is something at school which is entirely theirs, something that is a creative project where they are really and truly expressing themselves...they’re going to want to get to school. I think arts education is a huge part of that. I also think sports is a big part of that.LITHGOW: Creating a show like this is to try to persuade people just to wake up. I mean, you’ve got to think about the children, especially after the children have endured two years of a pandemic. Two years of pandemic has been hard on all of this, all of us, but they’ve been catastrophic for kids. Kids are not used to going to school. They lost two years, and two years in the life of a child is an eternity.LITHGOW: I wanted it to be things that I’m not good at or had very little experience with, if any. I didn’t want to do any theater. I wanted to do things that were technically difficult. I wanted to insert myself into a situation where I still had a lot to learn or a lot to remember. I wanted to be with a bunch of bright kids who were having a lot of fun with the new kid in class and trying to bring him up to speed.LITHGOW: They weren’t particularly dazzled by my presence. Not a lot of them, to my dismay, really knew who I was, until somebody mentioned “Shrek,” you know? And that was only my voice. But they were very game, and they were such superb kids. Look, these were kids who had decided to go to ceramics class. They had decided to go to dance class. They had decided to go to the LA County High School of the Arts to study voice. They were serious about what they did, and they knew this was well-intentioned.LITHGOW: It was incredible fun. It was very hard work because these were rigorous things. It’s not easy showing up to do a documentary every morning for two months, but it’s fun. It’s a very good thing that we captured my own insecurity. I knew it was important for me to look like the fool and for the kids to look like the experts and...watch me fail and fail until I had a tiny measure of success — and to try to capture that joy. Because joy is what it was all about.",2024-04-25 05:44:48 AM EEST,NPR,John Lithgow takes on the role of the new kid in school for a PBS special celebrating arts education,https://apnews.com/article/john-lithgow-arts-school-pbs-98c4ec149cfe203dfe057514a6940db6
Tom Krisher,"DETROIT (AP) — Ford Motor Co.'s first-quarter net income fell 24% from a year ago as the company’s combustion engine vehicle unit saw revenue and sales decline.The Dearborn, Michigan, automaker said Wednesday it made $1.33 billion from January through March, compared with $1.76 billion a year earlier.Excluding one-time items, Ford made 49 cents per share, enough to beat analyst estimates of 43 cents, according to FactSet.Revenue for the quarter was up 3.2% to $42.78 billion, but that fell short of Wall Street estimates of $42.93 billion.Ford Blue, the combustion engine unit, made $905 million before taxes, down $1.7 billion from a year ago. Revenue was down 13%. The company blamed the declines on lower inventories and selection of F-150 pickups due to updating factories for a new model.Chief Financial Officer John Lawler told reporters Wednesday that Ford will recover sales volume and selection later in the year, positioning the company for strong earnings.Ford Pro, the commercial vehicle unit, offset some of the decline, posting pretax earnings of just over $3 billion, more than double the same period last year. Pro revenue was up 36%.“We’re very profitable now, but we believe that this business will be profitable and durable for many years to come,” CEO Jim Farley said of the commercial unit.But Model e, the electric vehicle business, lost $1.3 billion, almost $600 million more than the first quarter of last year. The company said it’s cutting costs, but those have been erased by electric vehicle price declines across the industry.Farley said the EV business is the “main drag” on Ford’s performance right now. But he pledged further cost cuts, and profits on the next generation of electric vehicles coming out in the next two to three years. A small team at the company is working on underpinnings for smaller more affordable EVs, the company said.“We’re going to build a sustainably profitable EV business,” Farley said. “And it needs to return the cost of capital on its own and not be subsidized.”The company held its full-year pretax earnings forecast at $10 billion to $12 billion, but Lawler predicted it would be toward the high end of the range.It lowered an estimate of full-year capital spending to $8 billion to $9 billion, down from earlier guidance of $8 billion to $9.5 billion. The company said the reduced spending shows its commitment to using capital efficiently.Lawler said Ford expects U.S. auto prices to fall 2% to 3% this year, but said that drop didn’t materialize in the first quarter. Prices, he said, held up across the industry.Still, Ford expects the price drop to happen later in the year.“So far, the consumer stayed relative strong, industry has remained strong,” he said.Shares of Ford rose 3% in trading after Wednesday’s closing bell.",2024-04-25 01:31:20 AM EEST,NPR,Ford’s 1Q net income falls 24% as combustion engine unit sees sales and revenue decline,https://apnews.com/article/ford-earnings-first-quarter-down-24-a03a705414d00ea51cbfcb5a5c38490b

"Jonel Aleccia,Laura Ungar","U.S. health and agriculture officials are ramping up testing and tracking of bird flu in dairy cows in an urgent effort to understand — and stop — the growing outbreak.So far, the risk to humans remains low, officials said, but scientists are wary that the virus could change to spread more easily among people.The virus, known as Type A H5N1, has been detected in nearly three dozen dairy herds in eight states. Inactive viral remnants have been found in grocery store milk. Tests also show the virus is spreading between cows, including those that don’t show symptoms, and between cows and birds, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.Starting Monday, hundreds of thousands of lactating dairy cows in the U.S. will have to be tested — with negative results — before they can be moved between states, under terms of a new federal order.Here’s what you need to know about the ongoing bird flu investigation:This strain of what’s known as highly pathogenic avian influenza has been circulating in wild birds for decades. In recent years, it has been detected in scores of mammals around the world. Most have been wild animals, such as foxes and bears, that ate sick or dying birds. But it’s also appeared in farmed minks. It’s shown up in aquatic mammals, such as harbor seals and porpoises, too. The virus was even found in a polar bear in northern Alaska.The virus was discovered in ruminants — goats and then dairy cows — in the U.S. this spring, surprising many scientists who have studied it for years.“When we think of influenza A, cows are not typically in that conversation,” said Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.Flu viruses are notorious for adapting to spread among new species, so detection in dairy cows raises concerns it could spread to people, Webby said.Scientists confirmed the virus in cows in March after weeks of reports from dairy farms that the animals were falling ill. Symptoms included lethargy, sharply reduced milk supply and changes to the milk, which became thick and yellow.Finding remnants of the virus in milk on the market “suggests that this has been going on longer, and is more widespread, than we have previously recognized,” said Matthew Aliota, a veterinary medicine researcher at the University of Minnesota.Under pressure from scientists, USDA officials released new genetic data about the outbreak this week.The data omitted some information about when and where samples were collected, but showed that the virus likely was spread by birds to cattle late last year, said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist with the University of Arizona.Since then, it has spread among cattle and among farms, likely through contact with physical objects such as workers’ shoes, trucks or milking machines, Worobey said.And then the cows spread the virus back to birds, he said.“The genetic evidence is as clear as could be,” Worobey said. “Birds that are sampled on these farms have viruses with clear mammalian adaptations.”Several experts said the USDA’s plans to require testing in cows are a good start.“We need to be able to do greater surveillance so that we know what’s going on,” said Thomas Friedrich, a virology professor at the University of Wisconsin’s veterinary school.Worobey said the ideal would be to screen every herd. Besides looking for active infections, agriculture officials also should be looking at whether cows have antibodies to the virus, indicating past infections, he said.“That is a really accessible and quick way to find out how widespread this is,” he said.More testing of workers exposed to infected animals is also crucial, experts said. Some farm owners and some individual workers have been reluctant to work with public health officials during the outbreak, experts have said.“Increased surveillance is essentially an early warning system,” Aliota said. “It helps to characterize the scope of the problem, but also to head off potentially adverse consequences.”Scientists are working to analyze more samples of retail milk to confirm that pasteurization, or heat-treating, kills the H5N1 virus, said Dr. Don Prater, acting director of the FDA’s food safety center. Those results are expected soon.While the general public doesn’t need to worry about drinking pasteurized milk, experts said they should avoid raw or unpasteurized milk.Also, dairy farm workers should consider extra precautions, such as masking, hand washing and changing work clothes, Aliota said.So far, 23 people have been tested for the virus during the outbreak in dairy cows, with one person testing positive for a mild eye infection, CDC officials said. At least 44 people who were exposed to infected animals in the current outbreak are being monitored for symptoms.David O’Connor, a virology expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, likened recent bird flu developments to a tornado watch versus a warning.“There are some of the ingredients that would be necessary for there to be a threat, but we’re not there,” he said. As with a tornado watch, “you wouldn’t change anything about how you live your daily life, but you would maybe just have a bit of increased awareness that something is happening.”Worobey said this is the kind of outbreak “that we were hoping, after COVID, would not go unnoticed. But it has.”He said ambitious screening is needed “to detect things like this very quickly, and potentially nip them in the bud.”The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

None,"NEW YORK (AP) — The former Instagram influencer known as “ Jay Mazini ” who swindled millions of dollars from online followers and a network of Muslims during the pandemic was sentenced to seven years in prison on Wednesday, prosecutors said.Jebara Igbara, 28, of New Jersey, had pleaded guilty to fraud charges, admitting that he created a Ponzi scheme that involved cryptocurrency frauds netting around $8 million. Prosecutors say the money funded a decadent lifestyle that included luxury cars and a lot of gambling.Exploiting the economic chaos of the COVID-19 pandemic, Igbara leveraged connections in the Muslim community to gather investments for his firm Hallal Capital LLC, saying it would earn returns on stocks, and the reselling of electronics and personal protective equipment.“Shamefully, he targeted his own religious community, taking advantage of their trust in him so he could spend and gamble their hard-earned money,” said Breon Peace, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, in a statement.As he networked with high-value investors locally, Igbara amplified his online persona, reaching around 1 million Instagram followers, prosecutors said.He built a following in part by filming cash giveaways, often handing stacks of money to fast food workers or everyday people checking out at Walmart. In at least one video, he handed out cash alongside rapper 50 Cent.Viewers got the impression he was so successful he could just give money away. And his online popularity earned him even more trust from fraud victims, prosecutors said.By 2020, he attracted the ire of online sleuths who openly accused him of fraud, and cheered when he was arrested in 2021 on kidnapping charges. He later admitted in another case to kidnapping a potential witness to his frauds.But many of his victims did turn to the FBI, according to court documents.At least four people told FBI agents they sent over $100,000 in Bitcoin, on a promise of a cash wire transfer, according to court documents. One victim reported being scammed out of 50 Bitcoin, with Igbara first faking $2.56 million in a wire transfer, and later explaining away why the transfers hadn’t arrived.Igbara addressed the people he ripped off ahead of his sentencing on Wednesday in a Brooklyn federal court.“He apologized profusely to his victims,” lawyer Jeffrey Lichtman said following the sentencing Wednesday in Brooklyn.Igbara’s seven-year sentence for fraud will run concurrently with five-year prison sentencing for the kidnapping and includes time served since 2021, his lawyer said.As part of his sentence, Igbara is ordered to pay $10 million to his victims.As for “Jay Mazini,” the Instagram and other social media accounts are mostly scrubbed. But the saga lives on in compilations on YouTube, and in an episode of the 2023 documentary series “ The Age of Influence.”",2024-04-25 04:25:55 AM EEST,NPR,Instagram fraudster ‘Jay Mazini’ has been sentenced for his crypto scheme that preyed on Muslims,https://apnews.com/article/jay-mazini-jail-fraud-instagram-btc-8c3ab6a9281354423e2adf1c14ffd72c

Jon Gambrell,"JERUSALEM (AP) — A ship traveling in the Gulf of Aden came under attack Thursday, officials said, the latest assault likely carried out by Yemen’s Houthi rebels over Israel’s ongoing war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.The attack comes after the U.S. military said early Thursday an allied warship shot down a Houthi missile targeting a vessel the day before near the same area. The Houthis claimed that Wednesday assault, which comes after a period of relatively few rebel attacks on shipping in the region over Israel’s ongoing war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.In Thursday’s attack, a ship was targeted just over 25 kilometers (15 miles) southwest of Aden, the British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said.The captain “reports a loud bang heard and a splash and smoke seen coming from the sea,” the UKMTO said. “Vessel and all crew are safe.”The attack was also reported by the private security firm Ambrey.The Houthis did not immediately claim the attack, though it typically takes them hours to acknowledge an assault. European Union forces separately shot down a drone launched from Houthi territory on Thursday, Gen. Robert Brieger said.The Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, seized one vessel and sank another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration.Houthi attacks have dropped in recent weeks as the rebels have been targeted by a U.S.-led airstrike campaign in Yemen and shipping through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden has declined because of the threat. American officials have speculated that the rebels may be running out of weapons as a result of the U.S.-led campaign against them and firing off drones and missiles steadily in the last months.However, Wednesday’s attack was the first one by rebels in some time. An explosion struck some 130 kilometers (80 miles) southeast of Djibouti in the Gulf of Aden, the UKMTO said.Early Thursday, the U.S. military’s Central Command said the explosion came from a coalition warship shooting down the missile likely targeting the MV Yorktown, a U.S.-flagged, owned and operated vessel with 18 U.S. and four Greek crew members.“There were no injuries or damage reported by U.S., coalition or commercial ships,” Central Command said.Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, a Houthi military spokesman, claimed the attack but insisted without evidence that the missile hit the Yorktown. Saree also claimed the Houthis targeted another ship in the Indian Ocean, without providing proof. The Houthis have made repeated claims that turned out to not be true during their yearslong war in Yemen.The Houthis have said they will continue their attacks until Israel ends its war in Gaza, which has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians there. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 others hostage.Most of the ships targeted by the Houthis have had little or no direct connection to Israel, the U.S. or other nations involved in the war. The rebels have also fired missiles toward Israel, though they have largely fallen short or been intercepted.",2024-04-25 13:24:30 PM EEST,NPR,Ship comes under attack off coast of Yemen as Houthi rebel campaign appears to gain new speed,https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-rebels-attack-shipping-israel-hamas-war-80d6fac495801682a0e74550b6240599
Joshua Goodman,"MIAMI (AP) — A company started by a Texas billionaire oilman announced a deal Wednesday with Venezuela’s state-owned oil company to rehabilitate five aging oil fields, days after the Biden administration put a brake on sanctions relief over concerns about the fairness of the country’s upcoming presidential election.LNG Energy Group is a publicly traded company listed in Canada that produces natural gas in Colombia. It was created last year as a result of a merger with a company owned by Rod Lewis, a legendary Texas wildcatter who Forbes Magazine once called the “only gringo allowed to drill in Mexico.”As part of the deal announced Wednesday, LNG was awarded contracts by state-run PDVSA to take over production and develop two oil fields in eastern Venezuela that currently produce about 3,000 barrels of crude per day.LNG said the deal was executed within the framework of sanctions relief announced by the U.S. government last year in support of an agreement between President Nicolas Maduro and his opponents to hold a competitive presidential election this year. Last week, the Biden administration reimposed sanctions as hopes for a democratic opening in Venezuela fade.However, the White House left open the possibility for companies to apply for licenses exempting them from the restrictions, something that could attract investment to a country sitting atop the world’s largest petroleum reserves at a time of growing concerns about energy supplies in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Other than Chevron, which has operated in Venezuela for a century and was awarded its own license in 2022, few American companies have been looking to make major capital investments in the high risk South American country in recent years because of concerns about government seizure, U.S. sanctions and corruption.“This will be a test of U.S. sanctions whether they get a license or not,” said Francisco Monaldi, an expert on Latin American energy policy at Rice University’s Baker Institute.LNG said in a statement that it “intends to operate in full compliance with the applicable sanctions” but declined further commentLewis, who Forbes estimates has a net worth of $1.1 billion, struck it rich in the 1980s as a wildcatter drilling for natural gas near his home in Laredo, Texas. His company, Lewis Energy Group, was the state’s fourth biggest natural gas producer last year.In 2004, Lewis was awarded a contract by Mexico’s tightly controlled energy industry covering almost 100,000 acres (400 square kilometers) just across the border from his south Texas facility. He started investing in Colombia in 2003.In October, the U.S. granted Maduro’s government relief from sanctions on its state-run oil, gas and mining sectors after it agreed to work with members of the opposition to hold a free and competitive presidential election this year.While Maduro went on to schedule an election for July and invite international observers to monitor voting, his inner circle has used the ruling party’s total control over Venezuela’s institutions to undermine the agreement. Actions include blocking his main rival, ex lawmaker Maria Corina Machado, from registering her candidacy or that of a designated alternative. Numerous government critics have also been jailed over the past six months, including several of Machado’s aides.",2024-04-25 01:56:50 AM EEST,NPR,Billionaire Texas oilman inks deal with Venezuela’s state-run oil giant as US sanctions loom,https://apnews.com/article/texas-billionaire-venezuela-oil-company-deal-lewis-6285b797a3648fd914218623e9fd0f1e

That’s up from $5.71 billion, or $2.20 per share, in the same period a year earlier.Revenue rose 27% to $36.46 billion from $28.65 billion.Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings of $4.32 per share on revenue of $36.14 billion, according to a poll by FactSet.For the current quarter, the Menlo Park, California-based company said it expects revenue between $36.5 billion and $39 billion. Analysts are expecting revenue of $38.25 billion for the second quarter, which is higher than the midpoint of Meta’s guidance range.Meta also said it expects its 2024 capital expenses to be higher than anticipated due to its investments in artificial intelligence. It is forecasting expenses in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, up from its earlier guidance of $30 billion to $37 billion.The company has been investing heavily in AI and earlier this month unveiled a new set of artificial intelligence systems that are powering what CEO Mark Zuckerberg calls “the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use.”Meta, along with leading AI developers Google and OpenAI, and startups such as Anthropic, Cohere and France’s Mistral, have been churning out new AI language models and hoping to persuade customers they’ve got the smartest, handiest or most efficient chatbots.“Meta’s earnings should serve as a stark warning for companies reporting this earnings season,” said Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com “Even though the company did beat estimates in all top- and bottom-line metrics, it didn’t matter as much as the reported lowering revenue expectations for Q2. This is the exact opposite of what Tesla did yesterday and goes to show that investors are currently looking at the near future with heavy mistrust.”On Tuesday, electric vehicle maker Tesla reported that its first-quarter net income plummeted 55%. But it said it would accelerate production of new, more affordable vehicles, and on Wednesday its stock rose 12%.The number of people using Meta’s apps, meanwhile, continued to increase, with 3.24 billion users on average for March in its “family of apps” that includes Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. That’s up 7% year-over-year. Beginning this quarter, the company will no longer disclose user figures for Facebook.Meta had 69,329 workers as of March 31, a decrease of 10% year-over-year. Zuckerberg called 2023 the “year of efficiency” and the company laid off thousands to reduce expenses.Meta’s shares fell 16% in after-hours trading.

Yuri Kageyama ,"TOKYO (AP) — Spicy, steaming, slurpy ramen might be everyone’s favorite Japanese food.In Tokyo, long lines circle around blocks, and waiting an hour for your ramen is normal. What awaits might be just a dive, but a hot bowl of ramen rarely fails to hit the spot.Often cooked right before your eyes behind dingy counters, the noodle dish starts here at around 1,000 yen ($6.50), and comes in various flavors and local versions. There’s salty, soy-based “shoyu” or “miso” paste. Perhaps it’s red-hot spicy with a dash of chili. Sometimes there’s no soup at all but a sauce to dip the noodles in.The curly noodles are lighter than the darker buckwheat “soba,” or “udon,” which are also usually flatter or thicker.Ramen has also surged in popularity in the U.S., South Korea and other countries. Retail sales in the United States have risen 72% since 2000, according to NielsenIQ, a sales tracker. In the 52 weeks ending April 13, Americans bought more than $1.6 billion worth of ramen.In restaurants, versions beyond the traditional soup are appearing, said Technomic, a research and consulting company for the restaurant industry. Del Taco, a Mexican chain, recently introduced Shredded Beef Birria Ramen, for example.Packaged ramen that’s easily cooked in hot water at home is called instant noodles; it’s precooked and then dried. The story of how Momofuku Ando invented instant ramen in a backyard shed in 1958, when food was still scarce, is the stuff of legend in Japan. He went on to found the food giant Nissin Foods.Although convenient, instant noodles aren’t the same as the ramen served at restaurants.Some Japanese frequent ramen shops twice or three times a week. They emerge, dripping with sweat, smacking their lips.“I’m probably a talking bowl of ramen,” says Frank Striegl as he leads a dozen American tourists through the back alleys of Tokyo’s funky Shibuya district on what he calls “the ultimate ramen experience.”The crowd is led behind a shabby doorway, sometimes down narrow stairs, to a dim-lit table where ramen gets served in tiny bowls, practically the size of a latte cup, or about a quarter of a regular ramen bowl. That’s so guests have enough room in their tummies to try out six different kinds of ramen, two at each spot during the tour.One restaurant, Shinbusakiya, offers “Hokkaido classics” from the northernmost main island, while another, Nagi, offers “Fukuoka fusion,” from the southern main island of Kyushu. It includes a green ramen, similar to pasta al pesto. Syuuichi, which means “once a week,” features curry-flavored ramen.“It’s not just, of course, about eating delicious ramen, but also learning about it,” said Striegl, a Filipino American who grew up in Tokyo. He calls ramen “people’s food.”“A lot of countries around the world have their version of ramen in a way,” he said. “So I think because of that, it’s a dish that’s easy to understand. It’s a dish that’s easy to get behind.”While the tour participants were relishing their noodles, Striegl outlined a brief history of ramen: Its roots date back to the samurai era, when a shogun took a fancy to Chinese noodles, setting off the localizing journey for ramen that continues today.Katie Sell, a graduate student on Striegl’s tour, called ramen “a kind of comfort food, especially in the winter. Get a group of friends, go have some ramen and just enjoy it.”Kavi Patel, an engineer from New Jersey, said he was glad he included the humble ramen on his tour of Japan, along with more established attractions like the ancient capital of Kyoto and the deer park in Nara. “I’m having good fun,” he said.While ramen has never been more popular in Japan, ramen places have struggled because of the pandemic, the weakening Japanese yen, and the higher cost of wheat imports and energy, according to a study by Tokyo Shoko Research.One beneficiary of the pandemic is a home delivery service for frozen, professionally cooked ramen. Called takumen.com, it boasts some 500,000 subscribers in Japan.Another Tokyo operation, Gourmet Innovation, has signed on 250 of the country’s top ramen joints to sell packaged versions of their soup, noodles and toppings, to be heated up in boiling water and served at home.Co-founder and executive Kenichi Nomaguchi, who hopes to expand his business overseas, says ramen and animation are Japan’s most successful exports.Why ramen? Unlike pasta or curry, ramen is difficult to replicate at home, he said, Making it from scratch involves hours of cooking stock, with pork, beef or chicken, various fish or bonito flakes, and “kombu” kelp. Some stock uses oysters.Besides the different soup stocks and flavors, onions, grated garlic, ginger or sesame oil can be added for extra punch. Toppings can include bean sprouts, barbecued pork, boiled or raw eggs, seaweed, fermented bamboo shoots called “menma,” chopped green onions, cooked cabbage, snow peas or corn.Some insist a bowl of ramen is not complete without a slice of narutomaki, a whitefish cake with a pink spiral pattern.Unusual varieties include coffee ramen and ramen topped with ice cream or pineapple.Jiro-style ramen, named for a legendary restaurant in Tokyo, features mounds of vegetable toppings, huge steak-like barbecued pork and pungent, grated garlic seeped in a fatty pork-based stock.“Impact is important. So the pork has to be big so it’s truly memorable,” said Kota Kobayashi, who serves Jiro-style ramen at his chain, “Ore No Ikiru Michi,” which translates to, “The way I live my life.”Kobayashi is a former professional baseball player at the Yokohama Bay Stars, and played with the minor league Cleveland Guardians before switching to his ramen business.“When I quit baseball, I chose ramen as my way of life,” he said with a smile.He can wax philosophical about ramen. One cultural difference he has observed is that Americans tend to leave the noodles and drink all the soup, while the Japanese mostly do the opposite.And taste is only part of what makes good ramen. One must also offer entertainment, Kobayashi said.At his restaurants, the chopsticks are tucked in a box on a shelf, so first-time visitors ask where they are. Repeat customers go straight to that box. Kobayashi calls out, “Welcome back,” making the customers feel a connection, even if he doesn’t remember a thing about them.Dee-Ann Durbin contributed to this story from Detroit.Yuri Kageyama is on X: https://twitter.com/yurikageyama",2024-04-25 12:09:25 PM EEST,NPR,"More than just a bowl of noodles, ramen in Japan is an experience and a tourist attraction",https://apnews.com/article/japan-ramen-food-noodles-f7b36ca1fb7abc08c069bf8462e29dd6
Ken Moritsugu,"BEIJING (AP) — Global automakers and EV startups unveiled new models and concept cars at China’s largest auto show on Thursday, with a focus on the nation’s transformation into a major market and production base for digitally connected, new-energy vehicles.Toyota and Nissan both announced tie-ups with major Chinese technology companies as they strive to meet customer demand for AI-enabled online connectivity in cars, from social media apps to autonomous driving features.Electric vehicles accounted for about a quarter of all auto sales in China last year. Hybrids, which have trailed EVs, are expected to be a growing segment going forward.China’s largest EV maker, BYD, showed off two “dual-mode” plug-in cars that can run either solely on electricity or as hybrids. The other is a hybrid off-road SUV from its luxury Yangwang brand in the 1 million yuan-plus ($140,000) range.“China’s EVs, represented by (BYD’s) Qin and Han series, have successfully realized the large-scale replacement of traditional fuel cars, and this trend is irreversible,” said Lu Tian, the head of sales for BYD’s Dynasty models. The cars are named after former imperial dynasties.An executive from Chery, a more traditional Chinese maker, offered a more moderate perspective. Li Xueyong, a deputy general manager, said they envision a future of 40% fuel vehicles, 30% hybrids and 30% electric. The company plans to develop both fuel-powered and new-energy cars.BYD has been expanding rapidly into overseas markets, launching its low-priced Dolphin Mini, sold as the Seagull in China, in Latin American markets this year.It’s building a factory in Brazil on the site of a former Ford plant that closed when the U.S. maker left the country. Two other Chinese automakers including Chery already have factories in Brazil.BYD accounted for 41% of EV sales in Brazil in the first three months of this year, though the overall number is still relatively low.In Mexico, Chinese vehicles went from about 2.6% of the market in 2021 to 19.2% in the first quarter of this year. Most of those were gasoline-powered vehicles, as there are few charging stations and the cost of electricity makes it expensive to do so at home.Chinese makers are making inroads in Europe too, raising concern in some countries that they pose a potential threat to European automakers and jobs. The EU is weighing whether to impose tariffs on China-made EVs because of government subsidies that drove the industry’s growth.A proliferation of EV makers, encouraged by tax breaks as well as green-energy subsides, has prompted a fierce price war that is expected to lead to a shakeout and consolidation of the industry in the coming years.For foreign players aside from American EV maker Tesla, it has challenged them to accelerate the development of new electric car models to stay competitive in the world’s largest auto market.“No other region of the world has a transformation of the automotive industry that is as fast-paced as in China,” Volkswagen CEO Oliver Blume said Wednesday at an event previewing its appearance at the auto show.“This market has become something of a fitness center for us,” he said. “We have to work harder and faster to keep.”Other automakers expressed similar sentiments. Japan’s Nissan sent many top executives to the Beijing auto show to feel first-hand the pace of change in China, company President Makoto Uchida said.Nissan was going to sign a memorandum or understanding with Baidu, a Chinese search engine and AI company, later Thursday. Uchida said Nissan needs to meet the needs of Chinese customers and the speed at which the market is changing.“If we cannot do these two aspects, it will very difficult to keep our business in China,” he said.Toyota announced a tie-up with Tencent, the maker of the widely-used WeChat messaging and e-payment app.Volvo, the Swedish brand bought by China’s Geely group, stressed a simpler approach to the digitalization of its cars.Likely aiming at a somewhat older audience, the company said its new EX30 electric SUV has an audio system and tablet screen that are easy to operate and uses sustainable fabrics in its interior.“We believe that technology should be measured by its utility, not just its novelty,” said Xiaolin Yuan, Volvo’s Asia-Pacific head.The EX30 will sell for 210,000 to 260,000 yuan ($29,000 - $36,000) in China, the company announced.American brands at the show included Lincoln, Cadillac, Buick and Chevrolet. Ford presented a muscular look tied to its history, telling the story of the Mustang and Bronco - which it described as a “sports utility vehicle” when it was launched in 1966 — and showing the latest versions of those models.Associated Press researcher Yu Bing in Beijing and writers Mark Stevenson in Mexico City and Gabriela Sá Pessoa based in Sao Paulo, Brazil, contributed.",2024-04-25 10:28:41 AM EEST,NPR,Electric cars and digital connectivity dominate at Beijing auto show,https://apnews.com/article/china-auto-ev-toyota-byd-4d034a4b4c0621081c4824b64e461fd6
Paul Wiseman,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The International Monetary Fund has upgraded its outlook for the global economy this year, saying the world appears headed for a “soft landing” — reining in inflation without much economic pain and producing steady if modest growth.The IMF now envisions 3.2% worldwide expansion this year, up a tick from the 3.1% it had predicted in January and matching 2023’s pace. And it foresees a third straight year of 3.2% growth in 2025.In its latest outlook, the IMF, a 190-country lending organization, notes that the global expansion is being powered by unexpectedly strong growth in the United States, the world’s largest economy. The IMF expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.7% this year, an upgrade from the 2.1% it had predicted in January and faster than a solid 2.5% expansion in 2023.Though sharp price increases remain an obstacle across the world, the IMF foresees global inflation tumbling from 6.8% last year to 5.9% in 2024 and 4.5% next year. In the world’s advanced economies alone, the organization envisions inflation falling from 4.6% in 2023 to 2.6% this year and 2% in 2025, brought down by the effects of higher interest rates.The Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England have all sharply raised rates with the aim of slowing inflation to around 2%. In the United States, year-over-year inflation has plummeted from a peak of 9.1% in the summer of 2022 to 3.5%. Still, U.S. inflation remains persistently above the Fed’s target level, which will likely delay any rate cuts by the U.S. central bank.Globally, higher borrowing rates had been widely expected to cause severe economic pain — even a recession — including in the United States. But it hasn’t happened. Growth and hiring have endured even as inflation has decelerated.“The global economy continues to display remarkable resilience,’' Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF’s chief economist, told reporters Tuesday. “Most indicators continue to point to a soft landing.’'Still, Gourinchas noted that progress against inflation appears to have “stalled’’ so far this year and that the pace of price increases for services, such as healthcare and auto repairs, was proving especially stubborn.Though the world economy is showing unexpected resilience, it isn’t exactly strong. From 2000 through 2019, global economic growth had averaged 3.8% — much higher than the 3.2% IMF forecasts for this year and next. Keeping a lid on the world’s growth prospects are the continued high interest rates, along with sluggish gains in productivity in much of the world and the withdrawal of government economic aid that was rolled out during the pandemic.The IMF warns that the economic expansion could be thrown off by the continuing adverse effects of higher rates and by geopolitical tensions, including the war in Gaza, that risk disrupting trade and raising energy and other prices.China, the world’s No. 2 economy, has been struggling with the collapse of its real estate market, depressed consumer and business confidence and rising trade tensions with other major nations. The IMF expects the Chinese economy, which once regularly generated double-digit annual growth, to slow from 5.2% in 2023 to 4.6% in 2024 to 4.1% next year.But on Tuesday, Beijing reported that China’s economy expanded at a faster-than-expected pace in the first three months of the year, fueled by policies that are intended to stimulate growth and stronger demand. The Chinese economy expanded at a 5.3% annual pace in January-March, surpassing analysts’ forecasts of about 4.8%, official data show. Compared with the previous quarter, the economy grew 1.6%.Japan’s economy, the world’s fourth-largest, having lost the No. 3 spot to Germany last year, is expected to slow from 1.9% last year to 0.9% in 2024.Among the 20 countries that use the euro currency, the IMF expects growth of just 0.8% this year — weak but double the eurozone’s 2023 expansion. The United Kingdom is expected to make slow economic progress, with growth rising from 0.1% last year to 0.5% in 2024 and 1.5% next year.In the developing world, India is expected to continue outgrowing China, though the expansion in the world’s fifth-largest economy will slow, from 7.8% last year to 6.8% this year and 6.5% in 2025.The IMF foresees a steady but slow acceleration of growth in sub-Saharan Africa — from 3.4% last year to 3.8% in 2024 to 4.1% next year.In Latin America, the economies of Brazil and Mexico are expected to decelerate through 2025. Brazil is likely to be hobbled by interest high rates and Mexico by government budget cuts.",2024-04-16 19:21:05 PM EEST,NPR,"IMF: Outlook for world economy is brighter, though still modest by historical standards",https://apnews.com/article/world-economy-inflation-imf-china-growth-europe-bd95ab877bda8cd349cc48c0cbbe993f
"Tom Krisher,Gene Johnson","SEATTLE (AP) — A Tesla that may have been operating on the company’s Autopilot driving system hit and killed a motorcyclist near Seattle, raising questions about whether a recent recall went far enough to ensure Tesla drivers using Autopilot pay attention to the road.After the crash Friday in a suburban area about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of the city, the driver of a 2022 Tesla Model S told a Washington State Patrol trooper that he was using Autopilot and looked at his cellphone while the Tesla was moving.“The next thing he knew there was a bang and the vehicle lurched forward as it accelerated and collided with the motorcycle in front of him,” the trooper wrote in a probable-cause document.The 56-year-old driver was arrested for investigation of vehicular homicide “based on the admitted inattention to driving, while on Autopilot mode, and the distraction of the cell phone while moving forward, putting trust in the machine to drive for him,” the affidavit said.The Tesla driver told the trooper that he was driving home from having lunch when the crash occurred at about 3:45 p.m.The motorcyclist, Jeffrey Nissen, 28, of Stanwood, Washington, was under the car and pronounced dead at the scene, authorities reported.Authorities said they have not yet independently verified whether Autopilot was in use at the time of the crash. “We have not gotten that far yet. It’s very early stages of the investigation,” Washington State Patrol Capt. Deion Glover said Wednesday.The death comes about four months after U.S. auto safety regulators pressured Tesla into recalling more than 2 million vehicles to fix a defective system that’s supposed to make sure drivers pay attention when using Autopilot.A message was left Wednesday seeking comment from Tesla, which collects online data from its vehicles.Under the December recall, part of a two-year investigation into Teslas on Autopilot hitting emergency vehicles parked on roadways, Tesla reluctantly agreed to update Autopilot software to increase warnings and alerts to drivers.Autopilot can keep a car centered in its lane and a distance from vehicles in front of it, but Tesla says on its website that the cars can’t drive themselves, despite the name.The company’s monitoring system sends alerts to drivers if it fails to detect torque from hands on the steering wheel, a system that experts have described as inadequate. They say the systems should have infrared cameras that make sure drivers have their eyes on the road.It’s not known whether the Tesla involved in the Washington motorcyclist’s death got the software update specified in the recall, but documents filed by Tesla with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration say most newer Teslas have software that would automatically include the update.Kelly Funkhouser, associate director of vehicle technology for Consumer Reports, said it’s her understanding that the software update automatically went to most Teslas.Many Teslas have cameras in the cabin that can watch drivers using Autopilot, but Funkhouser said Consumer Reports found in testing that the cameras can be covered up by drivers without consequences.The government should be investigating the crash to see if the recall fixes are doing what they were intended to do, said Philip Koopman, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University who studies vehicle-automation safety.If Autopilot was in use, “NHTSA should be looking at this as a data point as to whether Tesla has effectively removed unreasonable risk from the use of Autopilot,” Koopman said. “The problem is this affects other road users, which is why regulatory intervention is appropriate.”A message was left seeking comment from NHTSA. Since 2016, the agency has sent investigators to at least 35 crashes in which Teslas suspected of operating on a partially automated driving system hit parked emergency vehicles, motorcyclists or tractor trailers that crossed in the vehicles’ paths, causing a total of 17 deaths.The agency also is investigating crashes involving automated driving systems from other automakers. Most recently it sent teams to two fatal crashes involving Ford Mustang Mach-E electric vehicles.Krisher reported from Detroit.",2024-04-24 23:11:58 PM EEST,NPR,Tesla driver in Seattle-area crash that killed motorcyclist told police he was using Autopilot,https://apnews.com/article/tesla-crash-washington-autopilot-motorcyclist-killed-a572c05882e910a665116e6aaa1e6995
Cora Lewis,"NEW YORK (AP) — When Anna Branch, 37, had her hours at work reduced at the start of the pandemic in 2020, she suddenly noticed ads for an app called EarnIn.“You know how they get you — the algorithms — like they’re reading your mind,” Branch said. “The ad said I could get up to $100 this week and repay it in my next pay period.”Branch, who was working as an administrative assistant in Charleston, South Carolina, downloaded the app, agreed to the flat fee, and added the suggested “tip.” The cash helped her cover expenses until payday, when the app debited the borrowed $100, plus $18 for the fee and tip. Four years later, Branch said she still uses the app, as often as once a month.EarnIn is one of more than a dozen companies that provide this service, billed as Earned Wage Access. The apps extend small short-term loans to workers in between paychecks so they can pay bills and meet everyday needs. On payday, the user repays the money out of their wages. Between 2018 and 2020, transaction volume tripled from $3.2 billion to $9.5 billion, according to Datos Insights.While Earned Wage Access apps have been around for over a decade, the pandemic and its aftermath boosted their popularity. Some apps have approachable human names — like Dave, Clio, Albert, and Brigit — while others suggest financial freedom: Empower, FloatMe, FlexWage, Rain. The typical user earns less than $50,000 a year, according to the Government Accountability Office, and has experienced the pinch of two years of high inflation.Proponents of the apps say they help people living paycheck to paycheck manage their finances and avoid the need for more onerous options, such as payday loans or overdrawing a bank account. But some analysts, consumer advocates and lawmakers say the apps are actually payday loans in a new tech wrapper, and that they can trap users in an endless cycle of borrowing that depletes their earnings.Critics also say the costs of the loans are not always transparent. Many charge monthly subscription fees and most charge mandatory fees for instant transfers of funds, though there is typically a no-cost option to receive funds in one to three business days. The average APR for a loan repaid in seven to 14 days was 367%, a rate comparable to payday lending, according to a report from the Center for Responsible Lending.Muddying the waters is the fact that some employers have integrated Earned Wage Access apps into their payroll, with different costs, models, and fee structures. Amazon and Walmart, for example, do not always charge employees for early access to earned wages outside of regular pay periods.Sheri Wilkins, 60, who works as a home health aide in College Station, Texas, said she’s used the apps since 2020, and that she feels “dependent on the money.”The health care contractor that employs Wilkins offers DailyPay, and Wilkins typically uses the app to transfer the amount of that day’s wages ($10.60 an hour) twice a day — once after each of her two shifts, for which she’s paid separately. Each time, she pays a $3.49 fee, for a total of $7 a day. At $35 a week, the app eats up more than three hours of her pay weekly, or a-day-and-a-half’s work per month.“They get you hooked on having that money,” Wilkins said. “It’s fine and great to have it — to buy groceries and cigarettes — but when it comes time to have your paycheck, it’s only $50-$60.”Wilkins said she was not aware the app had a free option, which would transfer the money in one to three days. She said the app always directed her to the instant transfer option.A spokesperson for DailyPay said in a statement that the app offers two options with no fees to most users and a third with what they described as a “small ATM-like fee.”Matt Bahl, who researches workplace issues for the Financial Health Network, said the growth of the Earned Wage Access industry is a symptom of widespread financial insecurity.“It’s meant to help solve short-term liquidity challenges,” he said. “But if those challenges are the result of insufficient income, it won’t solve them. You can’t ‘tech’ your way out of material deficits.”Andrew Lewis, 32, who lives in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, said he uses EarnIn, in part to meet unexpected expenses. Lewis works as a process technician for an electronics manufacturing company, and said he sometimes uses the app as often as every week, for gas money or something his toddler or wife needs.Lewis usually pays the “tips” the apps suggest, he said, but he doesn’t “like them that much,” in part because of the messaging.“Tips keep us running for millions of members like you,” EarnIn’s in-app copy reads. The company says it uses tips to maintain a no-fee option.“I feel a little guilty because of how they make it sound,” Lewis said.In 2021, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation found “users often feel compelled to leave (tips) due to applied pressure tactics like... claiming tips are used to support other vulnerable consumers or for charitable purposes.”In its report, the department found that borrowers who use Earned Wage Access take out an average of 36 loans a year. On 5.8 million transactions, 73% of consumers paid a “tip,” at $4.09 per tip on average. On three dozen loans, that’s $147 annually in tips alone.Penny Lee, head of the Financial Technology Association, an industry group, says more people are turning to Earned Wage Access as a convenience that allows them to make up for the “disconnect between what the consumer needs to be able to spend … and their pay cycle.”Like Buy Now, Pay Later loans, the apps don’t run credit checks and bill themselves as interest-free. Unlike payday loans or auto title loans, where borrowers pledge their vehicles as collateral, users of the apps don’t face balloon payments, black marks on their credit reports, or the possibility of losing their car if they fail to pay. Supporters also say the apps don’t sue or send collectors after unpaid debts.The FTA says the average cost per use of an Earned Wage Access app is between $2.59 and $6.27. The companies say the charges are comparable to ATM fees and cheaper than overdraft fees, which people incur if they don’t have enough money left in a checking account to cover a bill before payday. The average overdraft fee is more than $25 and can be as high as $36.However, in its report, the Center for Responsible Lending found that users of the apps experienced a 56% increase in checking account overdrafts.A number of states have moved to regulate Earned Wage Access by capping fees on these products. The industry backs a federal bill, currently before Congress, that would exclude the apps from being regulated by the Truth in Lending Act.When Connecticut passed a law capping the fees the apps could charge, EarnIn stopped operating in the state. Asked why, EarnIn CEO Ram Palaniappan said it was no longer “economically viable.”Both California and Hawaii are currently drafting laws to rein in Earned Wage Access fees.Rep. Bryan Steil, R-WI, one of the federal bill’s backers said, it will “ensure workers across the country can continue to use these services, which help them to better connect work to reward.”But Hawaii State Sen. Chris Lee, a Democrat who introduced regulation targeting Earned Wage Access in the state Senate, called the 300-plus percentage interest rates a “modern payday loan scheme.” Lee said he would like to see more transparency and worker protections.Lauren Saunders, an attorney at the National Consumer Law Center, says this a pivotal moment for regulation.“If (Earned Wage Access) were being used by people to cover one emergency cost a year, it could be better than being subject to overdraft fees or payday or auto title loans,” she said. “But being better than terrible predatory products shouldn’t be the bar.”The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

David Koenig,"The Biden administration issued final rules Wednesday to require airlines to automatically issue cash refunds for things like delayed flights and to better disclose fees for baggage or canceling a reservation.The Transportation Department said airlines will be required to provide automatic cash refunds within a few days for canceled flights and “significant” delays.Under current regulations, airlines decide how long a delay must last before triggering refunds. The administration is removing that wiggle room by defining a significant delay as lasting at least three hours for domestic flights and six hours for international ones.Airlines still will be allowed to offer another flight or a travel credit instead, but consumers can reject the offer.The rule will also apply to refunds of checked-bag fees if the bag isn’t delivered within 12 hours for domestic flights or 15 to 30 hours for international flights. And it will apply to fees for things such as seat selection or an internet connection if the airline fails to provide the service.Complaints about refunds skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic, as airlines canceled flights and, even when they didn’t, many people didn’t feel safe sharing a plane cabin with other passengers.Airlines for America, a trade group for large U.S. carriers, noted that refund complaints to the Transportation Department have fallen sharply since mid-2020. A spokesperson for the group said airlines “offer a range of options — including fully refundable fares — to increase accessibility to air travel and to help customers make ticket selections that best fit their needs.”The group said the 11 largest U.S. airlines issued $43 billion in customer refunds from 2020 through 2023.The Transportation Department issued a separate rule requiring airlines and ticket agents to disclose upfront what they charge for checked and carry-on bags and canceling or changing a reservation. On airline websites, the fees must be shown the first time customers see a price and schedule.The rule will also oblige airlines to tell passengers they have a guaranteed seat they are not required to pay extra for, although it does not bar airlines from charging people to choose specific seats. Many airlines now charge extra for certain spots, including exit-row seats and those near the front of the cabin.The agency said the rule will save consumers more than $500 million a year.Airlines for America said its members “offer transparency and vast choice to consumers” from their first search.The new rules will take effect over the next two years. They are part of a broad administration attack on what President Joe Biden calls “junk fees.” Last week, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg announced that his department will let state officials in 15 states help enforce federal airline consumer protection laws.",2024-04-24 18:55:18 PM EEST,NPR,Airlines will now be required to give automatic cash refunds for canceled and delayed flights,https://apnews.com/article/airlines-junk-fees-baggage-delays-c4a93f9ee9a2bf7d9ee07394183a0374
Zimo Zhong,"HONG KONG (AP) — Asian shares rose on Wednesday, led by an 2% gain in Japan’s Nikkei 225 after U.S. stocks rallied for a second straight day Tuesday, blunting the blow from what’s been a rough April.U.S. futures rose while oil prices edged lower.Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 jumped 2.1% in morning trading to 38,337.23, with the yen hovering at 34-year lows during the week.Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 index rose 0.3% to 7,705.70 following the release of a fifth consecutive quarter of decelerating inflation, with the consumer price index in the first quarter easing to 3.6% from previous 4.1%.In South Korea, the Kospi added 1.9% to 2,672.87, led by a 3.8% gain in heavyweight Samsung Electronics.The Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 1.3% to 17,053.06, while the Hang Seng Tech Index gained 2.7%. The Shanghai Composite index was up 0.2% at 3,026.88.Elsewhere in Asia, Taiwan’s Taiex gained 2.3%.On Tuesday, the S&P 500 climbed 1.2% to 5,070.55, pulling further out of the hole created by a six-day losing streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7% to 38,503.69, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 1.6% to 15,696.64.A weaker-than-expected report on U.S. business activity helped support the market, which remains in an awkward phase. The hope on Wall Street is for the economy to avoid a severe recession, but not to stay so hot that it keeps upward pressure on inflation.The preliminary report from S&P Global released Tuesday seemed to hit that sweet spot. Treasury yields eased in the bond market, and stocks added to gains immediately after its release.A flood of earnings reports also dictated much of trading, highlighted by a slew of companies that topped analysts’ expectations.GE Aerospace flew 8.3% higher after it raised its profit forecast for the full year, in addition to beating expectations for first-quarter earnings.Kimberly-Clark gained 5.5% after the maker of Huggies, Kleenex and Kotex also raised its earnings forecast for the full year. General Motors revved up by 4.4% after citing sales of pickup trucks and other higher-profit vehicles. Danaher rose 7.2% after pointing to strength in its bioprocessing and molecular diagnostics businesses.They helped overshadow an 8.9% drop for Nucor after the steelmaker fell short of forecasts for both profit and revenue.With skeptics still calling the broad stock market too expensive, criticism would ease only if companies were to produce higher profits or if interest rates were to fall. The latter has been looking less likely.Top officials at the Federal Reserve warned last week they may need to keep interest rates high for a while in order to ensure inflation is heading down to their 2% target. That was a big letdown for financial markets, dousing hopes that had built after the Fed signaled earlier that three interest-rate cuts may come this year.Lower rates had appeared to be on the horizon after inflation cooled sharply last year. But a string of reports this year showing inflation has remained hotter than expected has raised worries about stalled progress.That’s why Tuesday’s report suggesting a slowdown in growth for overall business activity across the country was so welcomed. It could keep the door open for the Fed to cut interest rates the one or two times that many traders are currently forecasting.The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.59% to relieve the pressure on stocks broadly, particularly high-growth ones and those that pay high dividends.In oil trading, U.S. benchmark crude lost 1 cents to $83.35 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

The euro cost $1.0707, up from $1.0697.The yen has been trading at 155 yen-levels lately, its lowest level in 34 years. That helps Japanese exporters by raising the value of their overseas earnings, but it also raises the price of imports. Speculation has been growing Japan may intervene to prop up the yen.On Wall Street, the S&P 500 was virtually flat and edged up by 1.08, or less than 0.1%, to 5,071.63. It had jumped sharply in the first two days of the week to claw back nearly two-thirds of last week’s steep loss.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 42.77, or 0.1%, to 38,460.92, and the Nasdaq composite added 16.11, or 0.1%, to 15,712.75.Tesla jumped 12.1% after saying the night before that it would accelerate production of new, more affordable vehicles, which investors have been hoping will kickstart growth. The announcement helped investors look past the 55% drop in profit that Tesla reported.Tesla is the first of the group of stocks among the Magnificent Seven to report its results for the start of 2024. The focus is on the small group of stocks because they drove most of the U.S. stock market’s gain last year, and they’ll need to perform to justify their high prices.Meta Platforms also reported its latest results after trading ended Wednesday. Alphabet and Microsoft will follow it a day later.The hope is that profit growth will broaden beyond the Magnificent Seven to other types of companies, in large part because a remarkably solid U.S. economy. They’ll likely need to deliver fatter profits if they want their stock prices to rise. That’s because they’re unlikely to get much help from the other lever that can lift stock prices: interest rates.“A strong earnings season looks likely to help restore market confidence,” according to Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management.A report Wednesday said orders for machinery, airplanes and other long-lasting manufactured goods were stronger last month than expected. A recent string of such reports has quashed hopes that the Federal Reserve may deliver the three cuts to interest rates this year that it had earlier signaled.Boeing lost 2.9% despite reporting results that weren’t as bad as analysts feared. The company, which is battling criticism about the safety of its airplanes, said it’s taking steps to improve its manufacturing quality, which has slowed down production.Teledyne Technologies tumbled 10.9% for one of the market’s largest losses after the seller of digital imaging sensors, cameras and other equipment reported weaker profit and revenue than forecast. It said demand from the industrial automation and test and measurement markets was weaker than it expected.On the winning side of the market, Hasbro jumped 11.9% after the toy and game company reported better profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It benefited from growth delivered by its Baldur Gate 3 and Magic: The Gathering games, as well as by its Peppa Pig content.Texas Instruments climbed 5.6% after reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than forecast. Boston Scientific was another one of the stronger forces pushing upward on the S&P 500.

Zimo Zhong,"HONG KONG (AP) — Asian benchmarks extended gains Tuesday after U.S. stocks clawed back a chunk of their losses from last week, which was the worst for the S&P 500 in more than a year, while the yen weakened further to fresh 34-year lows.U.S. futures were mixed and oil prices rose.Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 edged 0.1% higher to 37,471.73, despite the country’s manufacturing activity contracting for 11 straight months while approaching the break-even point in April as PMI came in at 49.9, according to Tuesday figures from au Jibun bank. The yen weakened further with it hitting a fresh 34-year low of 154.85 early Tuesday.The Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 1.2% to 16,715.15 while the Shanghai Composite index was down 0.6% at 3,025.76.Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 climbed 0.4% to 7,677.40. South Korea’s Kospi dropped less than 0.1% to 2,628.14.On Monday, the S&P 500 rose 0.9% to 5,010.60 to recover more than a quarter of last week’s rout. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.7% to 38,239.98, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 1.1% to 15,451.31.The rally was widespread, and most stocks across Wall Street rose. In the S&P 500, technology stocks led the way to bounce back from their worst week since the COVID crash of 2020.Nvidia leaped 4.4%, and Alphabet climbed 1.4% as Treasury yields stabilized in the bond market. Last week, a jump in yields cranked up the pressure on stocks, particularly those seen as the most expensive and making their investors wait the longest for big growth.Bank stocks were also strong following some encouraging profit reports. Truist Financial rallied 3.4% after its profit for the start of the year topped analysts’ expectations.They helped offset a 3.4% drop for Tesla, which announced more cuts to prices over the weekend. Elon Musk’s electric vehicle company has seen its stock drop more than 40% already this year, and it will report its first-quarter results later in the day.It’s a big week for earnings reports generally, with roughly 30% of the companies in the S&P 500 scheduled to say how much they made during the year’s first three months. That includes companies that have come to be known as part of the “Magnificent Seven,” beyond Tesla and Alphabet.The difference in growth between the Magnificent Seven and the rest of the S&P 500 should close by the end of the year, strategists Ohsung Kwon and Savita Subramanian said in a BofA Global Research report.Verizon Communications helped kick off this week’s reports by disclosing a drop in profit that wasn’t as bad as analysts expected. It cited price increases and other measures to support its revenue. Verizon’s stock swung from an early gain to a loss of 4.7% after it reported weaker revenue for the first quarter than expected and kept its forecast for full-year profit the same.Even more pressure than usual is on companies broadly to deliver fatter profits and revenue. That’s because the other big factor that sets stock prices, interest rates, looks unlikely to offer much help in the near term.Top officials at the Federal Reserve warned last week that they may need to keep interest rates high for a while in order to ensure inflation is heading down to their 2% target.

Fatima Hussein,"WASHINGTON (AP) — On this Tax Day, refunds are looking a bit bigger for taxpayers.According to the latest IRS statistics, the average income tax refund so far this season is $3,011, up $123 from last year. Two out of three taxpayers expect to receive a refund.The IRS is promoting the customer service improvements the agency rolled out since receiving tens of billions in new funding dollars through Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act. Getting refunds out faster — to some people in just over a week — is part of the promotion.So far, the IRS has delivered more than $200 billion in refunds through early April, and the latest agency numbers show that 101 million people have filed returns this tax season.At least one prominent person did not get a refund. President Joe Biden on Monday released the tax returns he filed with his wife, Jill, showing that he still owed the IRS $334 and the state of Delaware $1,480. But Jill Biden qualified for a $433 refund from Virginia, where she teaches. The Biden earned $619,976 and paid a federal income tax rate of 23.7%.From cutting phone wait times to digitizing more documents and improving the “Where’s My Refund” tool to show more account details in plain language, agency leaders are trying to bring attention to what’s been done to repair the image of the IRS as an outdated and maligned tax collector.The promotion also in part is meant to quickly normalize a more efficient and effective IRS before congressional Republicans threaten another round of spending cuts to the agency. So time is of the essence for both taxpayers and the agency.“This filing season, the IRS has built off past successes and reached new milestones,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on a Friday call with reporters. “It’s showing that when it has the resources it needs, it will provide taxpayers the service they deserve.”“It’s clear that we’re seeing historic improvements in taxpayer service levels, and the agency is rebounding from some very tough and lean years during the past decade,” said IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel.For most people, April 15 is the last day to submit tax returns or to file an extension.The IRS says call wait times have been cut down to three minutes this tax season, compared with the average 28 minutes in 2022. That has saved taxpayers 1.4 million hours of hold time and the agency has answered 3 million more calls compared with the same time frame. Also, the updated “Where’s My Refund” tool giving more specific information about taxpayers’ refunds in plain language was rolled out to 31 million views online.Werfel told The Associated Press earlier this year that the agency’s agenda is to deliver “better service for all Americans so that we can ease stress, frustration and make the tax filing process easier — and to increase scrutiny on complex filers where there’s risk of tax evasion.”“When we do that,” Werfel said, “not only do we make the tax system work better because it’s easier and more streamlined to meet your tax obligations. But also we collect more money for the U.S. Treasury and lower our deficit. The IRS is a good investment.”Major new initiatives in recent months have included an aggressive pursuit of high-wealth earners who don’t pay their full tax obligations, such as people who improperly deduct personal flights on corporate jets and those who just don’t file at all.This also is the first tax season that the IRS has rolled out a program called Direct File, the government’s free electronic tax return filing system available to taxpayers in 12 states who have simple W-2 forms and claim a standard deduction.If Direct File is successful and scaled up for the general public’s use, the program could drastically change how Americans file their taxes and how much money they spend completing them. That is, if the agency can see the program through its development in spite of threats to its funding.The Inflation Reduction Act initially included $80 billion for the IRS.However, House Republicans have successfully clawed back some of the money. They built a $1.4 billion reduction to the IRS into the debt ceiling and budget cuts package passed by Congress last summer. A separate agreement will take an additional $20 billion from the IRS over the next two years to divert to other nondefense programs.Government watchdogs warn IRS funding cuts will reduce the amount of revenues the U.S. collects.The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office reported in February that a $5 billion rescission from the IRS would reduce revenues by $5.2 billion over the next 10 years and increase the cumulative deficit by $0.2 billion. A $20 billion rescission would reduce revenues by $44 billion and a $35 billion rescission would reduce revenues by $89 billion and increase the deficit by $54 billion.See all of the AP’s tax season coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/personal-finance",2024-04-16 00:38:34 AM EEST,NPR,It’s Tax Day.

Anne D’Innocenzio,"NEW YORK (AP) — Ever since college, Brad Jobling struggled with his weight, fluctuating between a low of 155 pounds when he was in his 30s to as high as 220. He spent a decade tracking calories on WeightWatchers, but the pounds he dropped always crept back onto his 5-foot-5-inch frame.A little over a year ago, the 58-year-old Manhattan resident went on a new weight loss drug called Wegovy. He’s lost 30 pounds, and has started eating healthier food and exercising — the habits behind many commercial diet plans and decades of conventional wisdom on sustainable weight loss.Yet Jobling’s experience also has altered his perspective on dieting. He now sees obesity as a disease that requires medical intervention, not just behavioral changes. In fact, he thinks he will need to stay on a drug like Wegovy for the rest of his life even though it has taken some of the joy out of eating.“I don’t see how you can maintain (the weight) without medication,” Jobling said. “Obviously, it’s all about self-control. But I think it’s less of a struggle to really maintain healthy eating when you got that assistance.”Like the lives of the people taking them, recent injected drugs like Wegovy and its predecessor, the diabetes medication Ozempic, are reshaping the U.S. health and fitness industries. They have proven successful in eliminating unwanted pounds more quickly and easily than consuming fewer and burning more calories alone. Such is their disruptive power that even established diet companies like WeightWatchers and brands like Lean Cuisine are getting makeovers.Although celebrities like Oprah Winfrey have spoken publicly of the drugs as revolutionary, some health experts worry that businesses without any expertise will start dispensing the prescription medications along with bad advice and unproven therapies.At least 3 million prescriptions for the class of medications known as GLP-1 agonists were issued each month in the U.S. during the 12 months that ended in March, according to data from health technology company IQVIA. They include semaglutide, the drug in Ozempic and Wegovy, and tirzepatide, the drug in Mounjaro and Zepbound. Morgan Stanley research analysts have estimated that 24 million people, or 7% of the U.S. population, will be using GLPT-1 drugs by 2035.The world’s leading diet programs have taken note of such statistics and incorporated the popular drugs into their existing subscription plans.WeightWatchers, which was founded in 1963, last year acquired telehealth provider Sequence, enabling members to get prescriptions for weight loss drugs. WeightWatchers is sticking with its focus on behavior change as the cornerstone of weight reduction but launched virtual clinics that provide customized exercise and nutrition plans, as well as prescription care, for individuals who want to lose 20% of their body weight on average.“The weight loss space will be led by the acknowledgement that weight loss is a matter of health care,” WeightWatchers CEO Sima Sistani told analysts earlier this year. “This is a paradigm shift because weight loss has been and, unfortunately, often still is viewed as a vanity issue.”The Mayo Clinic, which first offered a weight management plan in book form in 1949, has published an updated version of the longtime bestseller, titled “The Mayo Clinic Diet: Weight-Loss Medications Edition.”The Mayo Clinic Diet program also has expanded to include access to weight loss drugs and advice on managing any side effects, according to Digital Wellness CEO Scott Penn, whose company developed an online platform for the original program.The new drugs have made being very overweight “feel more medical as a condition,” he said.Luxury athletic club operator Life Time launched a membership program last year that offers comprehensive medical testing, personalized training and a host of alternative therapies like cryotherapy. Members of the Miora program also can get Ozempic and other weight loss drugs through the medical staff of a clinic that opened in Minneapolis last year.Jeff Zwiefel, executive director of Life Time Miora, called the new drugs a “game changer” for the fitness industry.“We have an opportunity and an obligation and a responsibility to help people achieve results in conjunction with medical providers and make sure that that’s the way to go, "" he said.Fitness chains are banking on the idea people on the drugs will lose enough weight to overcome any self-consciousness or physical limits that kept them from exercising. The gym franchise Equinox started a new personal training program in January for prescription-holders who want to preserve or build muscle mass as they shed unwanted pounds.The world of drug-assisted weight loss also is altering the ambitions of food companies. Sales of SlimFast, a line of meal replacement shakes and snacks sold at supermarkets, have dropped as people turn to weight loss drugs and retailers cut shelf space for diet products, the brand’s parent company, Glanbia, told investors in February.Since the drugs suppress the appetites of people taking them, Glanbia and other companies are marketing their products as a source of adequate nutrients for people taking GLP-1s. Swiss multinational Nestle SA thinks it can benefit from the drugs’ popularity and is expanding its Lean Cuisine frozen meals and OPTIFAST protein shakes.“Diets are cool again,” Nestle SA CEO Ulf Mark Schneider told analysts in February. “It’s something that people used to do quietly on the side, uncertain about their outcomes.”Research has shown that about a third of people lose 5% or more of their body weight with diet and exercise alone, according to Dr. Louis Aronne, director of the Comprehensive Weight Control Center at Weill Cornell Medical school. In comparison, the medicine in the diabetes drug Mounjaro helped people with obesity or who are overweight lose at least a quarter of their weight when combined with restricted calories and exercise, a new study showed.But some experts worry about businesses marketing the drugs or serving as fitness coaches for patients on the medications. Dr. Cian Wade, a health care consultant for the global strategy and management firm Kearney, said he’s concerned about a proliferation of clinics that don’t have as much experience with obesity and related health conditions.“There’s a potential worry that for some patients, (the clinics) will not have the right expertise at hand to be able to appropriately manage the side effects, nutrition-related issues,” he said.Since GLP-1 medications are so new, it’s unclear how many patients will stick with their drug regimens, which produce intolerable side effects for some people. Another reason patients may drop the drugs is cost. A month’s supply of Wegovy costs $1,300, and Zepbound is priced at $1,000.Lisa Donahey, 54, an actress and singer who lives in Los Angeles, started Mounjaro under a doctor’s care a year ago to address her Type 2 diabetes. At the time, Donahey, who is 5-foot-7-inches tall, weighed 260 pounds and was a veteran of diet plans like Jenny Craig, WeightWatchers and Nutrisystem.Her weight has since dropped to a little less than 190 pounds. She goes to a gym. After always being cast as a character actor, she’s looking for new roles. Having used the medication to give her “a kick-start,” Donahey said she plans to wean herself off Mounjaro once she loses another 40 pounds.“I had a sense of hopelessness that I was destined to be this way and just could not do it by myself,” she said. “Now, with my weight being managed and the new version of ‘me’ is emerging, I just feel so empowered, excited and hopeful.”Read more of the AP’s Be Well content: https://apnews.com/hub/be-well",2024-04-25 12:52:10 PM EEST,NPR,What do weight loss drugs mean for a diet industry built on eating less and exercising more?,https://apnews.com/article/weight-loss-drugs-wegovy-diet-industry-weightwatchers-9df7a519d48e85f020151e291e982bea
Zen Soo,"HONG KONG (AP) — China’s economy grew faster than expected in the first quarter of the year with help from policies and stronger demand, though signs of weakness in the troubled housing market persisted.The world’s second-largest economy expanded at a 5.3% annual pace in January-March, beating analysts’ forecasts of about 4.8%, data released Tuesday showed. Compared to the previous quarter, the economy grew 1.6%.China’s economy has struggled to bounce back from the COVID-19 pandemic but gained momentum late last year as government policies to help the housing market and boost investment took effect.However, Tuesday’s better-than-expected data came days after China reported its exports sank 7.5% in March compared to the year before, while imports also weakened. Inflation cooled, reflecting deflationary pressures resulting from slack demand amid a crisis in the property sector.Investment in property developments fell 9.5% from a year earlier in January-March, compared with a decline of 9% in the previous quarter.“The investment and sales of real estate in the first quarter are indeed not very optimistic. The real estate market is still in a process of adjustment,” Sheng Laiyun, deputy commissioner of the National Bureau of Statistics, told reporters in Beijing.Sheng also acknowledged that while growth was stronger than anticipated, it was uneven. Investment in infrastructure such as roads and bridges rose 6.5% year-on-year after a 6% increase in the previous quarter.Fixed investment, in factories and equipment, grew 4.5% compared to the same period a year earlier, up from 4.2% in the previous quarter.China’s leaders have been trying to recalibrate growth away from investment spending and toward a greater reliance on consumer demand, similar to other major economies.While retail sales climbed 4.7% in January-March, growth in March was only 3.1% year-on-year.“Looking at the degree of recovery, we have found that the recovery of consumption is not as good as production, and the recovery of small and medium-sized enterprises is not as good as that of large enterprises, so there is a clear imbalance in the economic recovery,” Sheng said.Industrial output for the first quarter was up 6.1% compared to the same time last year, but it rose only 4.5% in March.The strong growth in January-March was supported by “broad manufacturing outperformance,” festivities-boosted household spending due to the Lunar New Year holidays and policies that helped boost investments, according to China economist Louise Loo of Oxford Economics.“However, ‘standalone’ March activity indicators suggest weakness coming through post-Lunar New Year,” she said. “External demand conditions also remain unpredictable, as seen in March’s sharp export underperformance.”Loo noted that an unwinding of excess inventory, normalization of household spending after the holidays and a cautious approach to government spending and other stimulus will affect growth in this quarter.Policymakers have unveiled a raft of fiscal and monetary policy measures as Beijing seeks to boost the economy. China has set an ambitious gross domestic product (GDP) growth target of about 5% for 2024.Such strong growth usually would push share prices across the region higher. But on Tuesday, Asian shares fell sharply after stocks retreated on Wall Street.The Shanghai Composite index lost 1.47% and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost 2.1%. The benchmark for the smaller market in Shenzhen, in southern China, lost 3.8%.Stronger growth in the region’s biggest economy normally would be seen as a positive for its neighbors, which increasingly rely on demand from China to power their own economies. However, strong growth figures are also viewed as a signal that the government will hold back on further stimulus.",2024-04-16 13:46:25 PM EEST,NPR,"China’s economy grew 5.3% in first quarter, beating expectations, though weak spots remain",https://apnews.com/article/china-gdp-economy-first-quarter-a0743b0982996194c07713c5c701918f
Patrick Stevens,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Shohei Ohtani had three doubles to improve his major league-leading batting average to .371, rookie Landon Knack got his first victory and the Los Angeles Dodgers routed the Washington Nationals 11-2 on Wednesday night.The Dodgers had a season-high 20 hits en route to their third straight victory, with Mookie Betts and Will Smith each having four hits and Andy Pages homering.Nick Senzel homered for Washington. The Nationals didn’t have a baserunner after the second inning.Ohtani went 3 for 6, hitting RBI doubles in the eighth and ninth innings. He leads the majors in slugging percentage (.695), OPS (1.128), extra-base hits (21) and doubles (14). He is hitting .429 during his nine-game hitting streak.“His average exit velocity on balls he puts in play, he’s got to be in a category by himself,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. “The ball just does different things when it comes off his bat.”A night after ripping a 118.7 mph solo shot in the ninth inning — the hardest-hit home run of his career — Ohtani smashed a 115.6 mph double to right-center in the first inning off Jake Irvin (1-2). Ohtani came around two batters later on Smith’s single.Betts pushed the lead to 3-0 in the second on a two-run single against a drawn-in infield.Senzel led off the Nationals’ second with a homer into the bushes in the visiting bullpen in left. Washington then scored again without putting the ball in plan, sandwiching two walks around a hit batsman before Joey Meneses pushed in a run with a walk.That was all the Nationals managed against Knack (1-1), who lost his debut against Washington last week. Knack retired his last 13 batters and struck out five over six innings.“I was just kind of missing off the edges,” Knack said about his second inning. “I’m a guy who really needs to be more north and south with everything, so it was basically just trying to get everything back over instead of trying to be too perfect, especially with the slider and changeup. It was just trying to figure it out and execute quick.”Max Muncy hit an RBI single in the third and Lux chased Irvin with a two-out, two-run single in the fifth. Irvin allowed six runs on 12 hits in 4 2/3 innings while striking out three.“He made some good pitches at times,” Washington manager Dave Martinez said. “He just didn’t have any consistency today. He fell behind, and that’s what got him.”Pages homered with one out in the eighth off Tanner Rainey, and Betts and Ohtani followed with back-to-back doubles to score another run.Dodgers: RHP Blake Treinen (bruised lung) allowed three runs while getting one out Tuesday in his first rehabilitation appearance for Triple-A Oklahoma City. ... RHP Walker Buehler (elbow) allowed five runs (three earned) and struck out five in four innings Wednesday for Oklahoma City.Nationals: Washington placed OF Lane Thomas (sprained left MCL) on the 10-day injured list and recalled INF Trey Lipscomb from Triple-A Rochester. Thomas was injured stealing second base in the fifth inning Monday.Los Angeles RHP Yoshinobu Yamamoto (1-1, 4.50 ERA) was set to face Washington for the first time Thursday, while the Nationals were scheduled to start LHP MacKenzie Gore (2-1, 3.60) in the finale of the three-game series.AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",2024-04-25 10:47:18 AM EEST,NPR,"Shohei Ohtani has 3 doubles, Landon Knack gets 1st victory as Dodgers rout Nationals 11-2",https://apnews.com/article/dodgers-nationals-score-ohtani-64a5f341a825e58dfc48968a41b70dba

Adriana Morga,"NEW YORK (AP) — For many people, tax season isn’t only about gathering W-2 forms or calling an accountant. It can also bring intense feelings of stress or anxiety about dealing with finances.Financial stress during tax season can manifest in different ways, whether that’s procrastinating on your tax return until the last minute or experiencing intense stress about filing incorrectly. If you’re dealing with financial stress right now, you’re not alone.“Many Americans experience high stress during tax times, and many Americans are dealing with financial stress,” financial wellness expert Joyce Marter said.You might think emotions and money don’t go together, but they often affect each other, said Lindsay Bryan-Podvin, financial therapist and founder of Mind Money Balance.“Our money and mental health intersect because they’re two parts of our overall wellness,” said Bryan-Podvin.Here are recommendations from experts to reduce financial stress during tax season while still getting your return done by the deadline:Financial stress can happen all year long. While tax season is only a window of time, it comes with something that can be daunting: a deadline. Some might find a deadline motivates them to get things done, while others can feel paralyzed by it, said Dr. Tanya Farber, psychologist at McLean Hospital, a mental health facility in Massachusetts.“If we’re overwhelmed by our anxiety, that’s where it may lead us to avoid thinking about finances or trying to avoid thinking about taxes,” Farber said.Although you do have an option of filing for an extension, Farber doesn’t recommend prolonging the period when you have to worry about taxes. Instead, a good first step is to make a detailed plan to tackle them.Farber recommends you break down all of the steps and start completing them one by one. A key step is to start gathering all of your documents, such as your W-2 or 1099 forms, savings and investment records, eligible deductions and tax credits, ahead of sitting down to file your taxes. Once you have a list of steps, scheduling times to complete the tasks will make it easier to build momentum.While the required documents might depend on your individual case, here is a general list of what everyone needs:If you need help making a plan, search for tax checklists, which can be a great tool to make sure you have everything you need.For many, anxiety over filing taxes comes from fear, Farber said. Whether it’s fear of making a mistake in your return or unexpectedly owing thousands of dollars, these fears can overwhelm you to the point of avoiding even looking at your taxes.If you identify that fear is what’s stopping you from filing, Farber recommends that you ask yourself if whatever you’re afraid of is likely to happen.“When we have fears, they’re possible, probable or definite,” Farber said. “And oftentimes anxiety is the highest when we’re assuming the worst-case scenario.”If thinking about your fears by yourself is not helping, Bryan-Podvin recommends you discuss them with a friend or a family member. In many cases, talking with someone else might help you focus on what might actually happen rather than focusing on the worst-case scenarios.If tax season brings a lot of financial stress for you, Bryan-Podvin recommends that you increase the amount of self-care activities you’re doing. Activities such as taking a walk, spending time with your dog or getting enough sleep can help soothe stress.“We are going to be doing things that are difficult and depleting and anxiety-provoking so doing more things that are restorative can help us balance that,” Farber said.Doing restorative activities can work as a toolbox of coping skills when you’re in the middle of a stressful situation, like filing taxes.You might feel like you’ll be judged if you talk about money, but that’s often not the case. Talking about finances with your friends or family can be a moment to receive support, she said.“Talking with others is going to give you access to more information and resources and also helps remove the shame and stigma because you’re not alone,” Marter said.Whether it’s talking with a tax professional or reaching out to your most tax-savvy family member, proactively seeking support will help you avoid being stressed if you’re filing very close to the deadline.Additionally, if you are experiencing mental health struggles, there are several resources you can use to find professional help.In the U.S., you can dial 211 to speak with a mental health expert, confidentially and for free.Other mental health resources include:Veterans Crisis Line: call 1-800-273-TALK (8255)Crisis Text Line: Text the word ‘Home’ to 741-741The Trevor Lifeline for LGBTQ Youth: 1-866-488-7386The Trans Lifeline: 1-877-565-8860The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

Will Graves,"PITTSBURGH (AP) — William Contreras had three hits and the Milwaukee Brewers used one big inning to edge the Pittsburgh Pirates 3-2 on Wednesday night.The Brewers took advantage of a sloppy second inning by the Pirates to turn an error, two walks and two hit batters and an RBI single by Contreras into three runs.Sal Frelick had two hits for Milwaukee, which snapped a two-game skid. Bryan Hudson (2-1) worked 1 2/3 innings of scoreless relief. Joel Payamps overcame a pair of errors in the ninth for his fourth save.Payamps made the first error, briefly mishandling a comebacker by Edward Olivares that allowed Olivares to reach safely. Frelick, in left field, let a fly ball by Oneil Cruz drop to put two runners on. Payamps then got Jared Triolo to line out then struck out pinch-hitter Andrew McCutchen to end it.“Everyone’s going to make errors and, you know, we’re a team, right?” Payamps said through a translator. “So that’s what we have to do. We got to pick each other up. ... The job was to strand that runner on base and that’s what we did.”Bryan Reynolds hit a two-run homer for Pittsburgh, but the Pirates managed just four hits against five relievers in a bullpen game that favored the Brewers.Bryse Wilson worked 4 1/3 innings while making his second start of the season. Wilson allowed two runs on three hits with three walks and three strikeouts. Given the injuries that have ravaged Milwaukee’s pitching staff, Wilson could be on his way to becoming a full-time starter, a role he filled earlier in his career.“I like him as a starter, I think he can do it,” Brewers manager Pat Murphy said. “And I think he’s, he’s just just, getting started at it, you know. And I think he’s he’s very, very capable. So with our situation right now, he’s a good option.”The Pirates opted to give Quinn Priester a couple of extra days to rest after making his 2024 major-league debut in a rocky outing last Friday against Boston. Reliever Josh Fleming (1-1) served as the opener, something he did occasionally last season while with Tampa Bay.Fleming cruised through the first two innings before running into trouble in the third. Frelick reached on an error by first baseman Rowdy Tellez and Brice Turang walked two batters later.Luis Ortiz came on in relief and promptly gave up an RBI single to Contreras. Ortiz, who was in the mix for a spot in the starting rotation during spring training before being sent to the bullpen, hit a pair of batters to force in a run and then walked Blake Perkins to give Milwaukee a 3-0 lead.Reynolds’ third home run of the season — a shot to the seats in right-center — in the bottom of the third brought Pittsburgh within one. But the Pirates never really threatened to tie it until the ninth. McCutchen — who had homered on Monday and Tuesday — couldn’t find a way to get pinch-runner Michael A. Taylor home.Pittsburgh has scored two or fewer runs seven times in its last eight games, a stretch in which the Pirates are just 2-6.“We were the big hit away from -- I mean, understatement -- but a big hit away from winning that game,” Pittsburgh manager Derek Sheltons said. “We created some opportunities late in the game but weren’t able to capitalize on it.”Brewers: LHP Robert Gasser made his season debut for Triple-A Nashville after missing time with bone spurs in his left elbow. The 24-year-old Gasser, considered one of the top prospects in the organization, allowed one run in four innings with five strikeouts.Pirates: C Yasmani Grandal (left foot) will remain at Triple-A Indianapolis through the end of the week. Pittsburgh general manager Ben Cherington said the team wants to give Grandal plenty of chances to run the bases in the minors since Grandal missed the vast majority of spring training.The series concludes on Thursday. Freddy Peralta (2-0, 1.90 ERA) starts for the Brewers against Pittsburgh’s Mitch Keller (2-2, 4.80).AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",2024-04-25 05:14:47 AM EEST,NPR,Contreras has 3 hits as Brewers take advantage of sloppy inning by Pirates in 3-2 victory,https://apnews.com/article/brewers-pirates-score-317bb1ea066054b05fa2b249e8b2d61c
Paul Wiseman,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The head of the International Monetary Fund said Thursday that the world economy has proven surprisingly resilient in the face of higher interest rates and the shock of war in Ukraine and Gaza, but “there is plenty to worry about,’' including stubborn inflation and rising levels of government debt.“ Inflation is down but not gone,’' Kristalina Georgieva told reporters at the spring meeting of the IMF and its sister organization, the World Bank. In the United States, she said, “the flipside’’ of unexpectedly strong economic growth is that it ”taking longer than expected’’ to bring inflation down.Georgieva also warned that government debts are growing around the world. Last year, they ticked up to 93% of global economic output — up from 84% in 2019 before the response to the COVID-19 pandemic pushed governments to spend more to provide healthcare and economic assistance. She urged countries to more efficiently collect taxes and spend public money. “In a world where the crises keep coming, countries must urgently build fiscal resilience to be prepared for the next shock,’' she said.On Tuesday, the IMF said it expects to the global economy to grow 3.2% this year, a modest upgrade from the forecast it made in January and unchanged from 2023. It also expects a third straight year of 3.2% growth in 2025.The world economy has proven unexpectedly sturdy, but it remains weak by historical standards: Global growth averaged 3.8% from 2000 to 2019.One reason for sluggish global growth, Georgieva said, is disappointing improvement in productivity. She said that countries had not found ways to most efficiently match workers and technology and that years of low interest rates — that only ended after inflation picked up in 2021 — had allowed “firms that were not competitive to stay afloat.’'She also cited in many countries an aging “labor force that doesn’t bring the dynamism’’ needed for faster economic growth.The United States has been an exception to the weak productivity gains over the past year. Compared to Europe, Georgieva said, America makes it easier for businesses to bring innovations to the marketplace and has lower energy costs.She said countries could help their economies by slashing bureaucratic red tape and getting more women into the job market.",2024-04-19 00:40:23 AM EEST,NPR,IMF’s Georgieva says there’s ‘plenty to worry about’ despite recovery for many economies,https://apnews.com/article/imf-world-economy-inflation-gaza-ukraine-georgieva-6c5a66e7bc6c7ed5fdd017bf57cf2296

Larry Fleisher,"NEW YORK (AP) — Aaron Judge hit a two-run homer in the first inning after Oakland starting pitcher Joe Boyle was called for a balk on the previous pitch and the New York Yankees beat the Athletics 7-3 on Wednesday night.Anthony Rizzo and Juan Soto also homered as the Yankees won for the fifth time in seven games and improved to 10-1 in their last 11 in the Bronx against Oakland.It was the first time Judge, Rizzo and Soto homered in the same game this season.Judge appeared to take a called third strike and was headed back to the dugout, but third base umpire John Tumpane charged Boyle (1-4) with a balk.“It was a quick pitch,” Judge said. “I kind of didn’t know what was going on, but it was more subtle waving, ‘Go back, go back’. Just, rules are rules.”Added Yankees manager Aaron Boone: “I didn’t even realize Judge was walking off because I saw the balk right away and I saw the call right away. So yeah, it worked out.”Judge then hit an outside fastball to the short porch in right field for his 261st homer, passing former captain Derek Jeter for ninth on the Yankees’ all-time list.“It’s an umpire judgment call, it was close,” Oakland manager Mark Kotsay said. “You don’t see that called that often and that moment it gives Judge another pitch and he capitalizes on it. That’s definitely umpire’s discretion and you can’t argue balks. So you kind of have to stick with that.”After hitting his fourth homer, Judge singled in the third. It was the slugger’s fourth multihit game this season and first since April 13.“I like what I saw tonight, just at-bat wise,” Boone said of Judge, whose average climbed from .180 to .191.Anthony Volpe opened the game by making a leaping catch on Ryan Noda and hit an RBI triple in the fourth on a ball that got by Oakland right fielder Lawrence Butler. The shortstop also scored on a sacrifice fly by Soto.Rizzo homered for the second straight game in the fifth after going deep for the first time since April 6 in New York’s four-run first Tuesday. Rizzo homered in consecutive games for the first time since May 19-20.Soto hit his sixth homer in the sixth, a drive that just cleared the center field fence adjacent to Monument Park.Alex Verdugo added a sacrifice fly as the Yankees totaled 11 hits.Brent Rooker hit a three-run homer in the sixth that knocked out New York starter Clarke Schmidt.Schmidt (2-0) allowed three runs and four hits in 5 1/3 innings.

Tyler Mason,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Willi Castro hit a 3-run home run on his 27th birthday and Joe Ryan pitched six innings for his first win of the year as the Minnesota Twins beat the Chicago White Sox 6-3 Wednesday.Castro’s homer capped a four-run second inning against Chicago left-hander Garrett Crochet. It was his second career home run on his birthday and it drove in Austin Martin and Christian Vásquez.“It’s the best birthday I’ve had so far,” Castro said.Castro entered the game batting .169 with one homer and four RBI as one of several Twins’ hitters struggling at the plate in the first month of the season. He also added a double off Crochet in the fourth for his second multi-hit game of the year.Ryan (1-1) had a pair of three-strikeout innings, but also allowed solo homers in the third to Kevin Pillar and Korey Lee. The Twins righty struck out eight and gave up three runs to win for the first time in five starts.Following the two homers, Ryan responded by striking out three batters — all swinging — in a scoreless fourth. He also pitched a 1-2-3 sixth inning to end his night.“He just kept pitching today,” Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. “I thought it was a very solid outing for Joe. He did his normal missing bats and not really walking (guys). ... That’s great stuff. That’s exactly what we’re looking for.”Minnesota, which had a season-high 13 hits, has won the first three games of the four-game series against the White Sox, who hold the worst record in the majors at 3-21.Crochet (1-4) surrendered five runs on seven hits in four innings. He’s lost his last three outings.“His stuff was working, it was effective. They had a good plan going into the game,” Lee said of Crochet. “He’s been doing well all year and I think they obviously did their homework on him. We do our homework on them, and they put the bat on the ball. When you put the bat on the ball, good things happen in this game.”Chicago executed a double steal in the fifth to cut Minnesota’s lead to 4-3. Lee beat a throw from Twins catcher Carlos Santana to steal second base, allowing Braden Shewmake to score from third base.The Twins added two runs in the bottom of the inning. Pinch hitter Max Kepler’s bloop to shallow center drove in Manny Margo, and Kepler later scored on a wild pitch. Kepler has driven in a run in each of his three games since returning from the injured list.Griffin Jax pitched a scoreless inning for his third save of the year.Chicago right-hander Michael Soroka (0-3, 7.50 ERA) is looking for his first win of the year after allowing five runs in each of his last two starts.

Bill Trocchi,"ATLANTA (AP) — Michael Harris II doubled home Ronald Acuña Jr. in the 10th inning and the Atlanta Braves edged the Miami Marlins 4-3 after blowing a two-run lead in the ninth Wednesday night to complete a three-game sweep.A.J. Minter (4-1) struck out Jazz Chisolm Jr. with the bases loaded and two outs in the top of the 10th to earn the win for the Braves, who have won nine of their last 10.“Every game is not going to be pretty,” Harris said. “I’m just glad our defense just gave us a chance to just need one run at the end. It was clutch of Minter to get those outs with runners on. (Austin) Riley made a nice play at third. Defense was great.”Riley threw out Nick Gordon at the plate with one out in the 10th, and Orlando Arcia threw out Chisholm at home with one out in the ninth to preserve the 3-3 tie both times.“You like the fight to battle back in the ninth against a really good closer and one of the best teams in the National League,” Marlins manager Skip Schumaker said. “It’s a tough loss. We’ve had a few of those this year. We had chances. We just couldn’t get the big hit.”The Marlins had tied it in the ninth with two runs off Braves closer Raisel Iglesias, who blew his first save in eight chances this season.Luis Arraez, Bryan De La Cruz and Chisholm all singled to load the bases. Braves first baseman Matt Olson committed a fielding error on Josh Bell’s grounder that allowed two runs to score and tied it at 3. Iglesias retired the next three batters to get out of the ninth.The Braves threatened in the ninth, but Acuña grounded into a double play with two men on to end the inning.Tanner Scott (0-4) took the loss for the Marlins, who have been swept three times this season.Braves starter Reynaldo López allowed one run and three hits in seven innings, walked two and struck out six. He has given up two runs in 25 innings for a 0.72 ERA in his first four starts with Atlanta.“The greatest thing you can have in this sport is really strong starts and we’ve had a bunch of them lately,” Braves manager Brian Snitker said. “He was really good again.”Harris was 3 for 5 with a run scored and the winning RBI. Marcell Ozuna went 3 for 4 with two RBIs to give him an MLB-best 29.Sixto Sánchez, starting for the first time since 2020, gave up three runs in 2 2/3 innings for the Marlins.Jesús Sánchez snapped a 21-inning scoreless streak for the Marlins with a 430-foot home run off the roof of the Chop House in right field in the second inning.Acuña opened the game for the Braves with a walk and stolen base, the eighth straight game he has reached base to lead off a game. He reached third on a single by Harris, then scored on a balk. Ozuna then singled home Harris for a 2-0 lead.Ozuna knocked in Olson in the third with a single after Olson doubled to right.

The loss eliminated New York from playoff contention in the six-team league.Catherine Daoust, Catherine Dubois, Laura Stacey and Mélodie Daoust also had goals for Montreal, which scored four times in the second period.“The second period has been our nemesis all year but we came out with a lot of energy after a slow start,” Montreal coach Kori Cheverie said. “And I was happy that we did a good job protecting the lead when they turned up the heat in the third.”Ann-Renée Desbiens made 31 saves, including 14 in the first period.“Having a first period like that gives a goaltender belief,” Desbiens said.Marie-Philip Poulin picked up one assist to move past Toronto’s Natalie Spooner for top spot in the league scoring race with 22 points.Ella Shelton and Alexandra Labelle, with a short-handed goal, scored for New York. Corinne Schroeder stopped 20 shots.New York failed to capitalize on its power play, coming up empty on three opportunities in the first period and finishing the game 0 for 5. Montreal was 2 for 4 with the extra player.O’Neill, who scored one of the power-play goals — Stacey had the other — said she was determined to step up her offensive game after helping Canada win the gold medal at the world championships earlier this month.“At the world championships, I was playing with two college girls and now I have (Poulin) on one side and Stacey on the right with her one-timer,” said O’Neill. “It’s a good fit.”Montreal travels to Ottawa on Saturday.New York hosts Toronto on Sunday.AP women’s hockey: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-hockey",2024-04-25 06:27:53 AM EEST,NPR,"O’Neill has a goal and an assist, Montreal clinches a playoff berth with 5-2 win over New York",https://apnews.com/article/new-york-montreal-score-b26464e2c61bbcb289239b1b59b78310

The Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, citing the dismissal document, said that motion was signed off later Tuesday by the presiding judge in the case.Isaacs played in all 34 games for the Red Raiders this season, averaging 15.8 points and 3.5 assists a game. When the lawsuit became public in January, the school said Isaacs remained in “good standing” and could continue playing.After 59 games over two seasons for Texas Tech, Issacs is now in the transfer portal and not expected to return to the Red Raiders.

Mitch Stacy,"CINCINNATI (AP) — Santiago Espinal had three RBIs, reliever Fernando Cruz pitched out a jam in the seventh inning and the Cincinnati Reds held on for a 7-4 win over the Philadelphia Phillies on Wednesday night.Will Benson had a solo homer in the third inning. Espinal singled home two as part of a four-run sixth and drove in another with a sacrifice fly in the seventh. That came on the heels of a 3-for-4 night for Espinal on Tuesday that included his first homer as a Red.Cincinnati starter Nick Lodolo went five innings, allowing three runs and six hits while striking out four and walking three.For the second straight night, Cruz came in with one out and stranded Phillies runners on second and third. Cruz struck out Edmundo Sosa with a splitter and induced a fly ball to right from pinch-hitter Brandon Marsh that Benson tracked down at the wall.“He just wants the ball. He wants to do his part,” Reds manager David Bell said of the 34-year-old right-hander. “He comes in fearless and believing in himself.”Said Cruz: “As a high-performance athlete, you want those situations. Those are the ones you want. I’m having a lot of fun doing it.”Elly De La Cruz had three hits and three stolen bases, increasing his major league-leading total to 15. In the eighth, he singled, stole second and third and scored on a fly ball by Spencer Steer.“The way he’s handling it is everything,” Bell said. “He continues to work. He understands the situation. He’s not just aimlessly running out there. He understands the pitchers who are on the mound, what’s he’s up against and then ability just taking over.”The loss wasted another excellent outing by Philadelphia starter Spencer Turnbull, who allowed a run and three hits through five innings with eight strikeouts in 89 pitches.“He was going back out (for the sixth) but (the Reds) made two pitching changes in that inning. It took about 25 minutes. That’s why we made the change,” Phillies manager Rob Thomson said. “If he was at 50 pitches, we’d have sent him back out, but once you’re in that 90 range, it was too long.”Turnbull has allowed just four earned runs and 13 hits in 27 innings through his first five starts.“I couldn’t ask for anything more,” Thomson said.Alec Bohm had four hits and two RBIs for the Phillies, who have lost two in a row to the Reds after taking the first game of the series on Monday.Reds: 2B/DH Jonathan India and OF Jake Fraley each missed their fourth straight game with illness.The Phillies send right-hander Zack Wheeler (1-3, 2.30 ERA, 38 Ks) against Reds right-hander Nick Martinez (0-0, 4.76) in the finale of the four-game series on Thursday afternoon.AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2024-04-25 06:04:54 AM EEST,NPR,"Santiago Espinal has 3 RBIs, Fernando Cruz pitches out of another jam and Reds beat Phillies 7-4",https://apnews.com/article/phillies-reds-score-a153ce3e52745c106415c5895d15a180
Mark Didtler,"ST. PETERSBURG, Fla, (AP) — Curtis Mead hit his first home run of the season and the Tampa Bay Rays beat the Detroit Tigers 7-5 on Wednesay night to avoid a three-game sweep.Ben Rortvedt collected his second RBI of the game with a single and scored on Mead’s two-run drive off Will Vest (1-1) that put the Rays ahead for good in the sixth inning. It was Mead’s first homer since Sept. 22.Tampa Bay had lost three in row and five of seven.“Awesome, for sure,” Rortvedt said. “Especially losing the first two games, our backs are against the wall. Really trying to come out with a win as we go into the off day. This is huge for us.”The Tigers completed a six-game trip at 4-2 and are 10-4 on the road this season.‘Well, the series win is nice,” Tigers manager A.J. Hinch said, “We’re’re happy with the road trip. It doesn’t end well. But keeping things in perspective, we’re doing some good things and we’re winning series, which is key. You want to get greedy when you have the chance to sweep. They came up bigger in the big moments and won the game.”After trailing by three early, Detroit took a 5-4 lead in the sixth on Buddy Kennedy’s run-scoring single and Javier Báez’s 600th career RBI that came on a double against Chris Devenski (1-1).Jason Adam went two perfect innings before Garrett Cleavinger worked the ninth to get his second save in as many chances.“That’s the beauty of baseball, you have a rough night or whatever you get to go back out,” Adam said. “I’d take this team over any other team in the league over the long run.”Mark Canha picked up his fourth and fifth RBIs in the series with a fifth-inning single off former Tigers’ left-hander Tyler Alexander that got the Tigers within 4-3.Alexander allowed two runs and three hits in four innngs. He went 11-23 in 120 games, including 43 starts, with the Tigers from 2019-23.“I’ve stayed away from him this series because I don’t want to like him this series,” Hinch said with a smile before the game. “I’ll love him tomorrow.”Canha’s two-out hit came after right fielder Amed Rosario grabbed Riley Greene’s drive to the warning track and held onto the ball after colliding with center fielder Randy Arozarena.Rortvedt had an RBI double in a three-run third off Jack Flaherty as the Rays took a 4-1 lead. Flaherty gave up four runs and seven hits over five innings.Arozarena, mired in a 9 for 77 (.117) slide in April entering the game, pulled Tampa Bay even at 1 with his first homer since March 31 in the first inning. The 2023 All-Star has three homers this season and is hitting .158 after going 1 for 4 with three strikeouts.Rays: CF Jose Siri missed the game to get treatment for a kidney stone.

Steve Mcmorran,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — After dominating Super Rugby for more than two decades, the Christchurch-based Crusaders have fallen into a funk this season from which they seem unable to extract themselves.The Crusaders are in last place after nine rounds of the current Super Rugby Pacific season with only one win. They face the fourth-place Melbourne Rebels in the 10th round on Saturday.The Crusaders’ sudden fall from grace has come with the usual baggage: fan anger and resentment, bitter recriminations from former players and calls for current head coach Rob Penney to go.The Crusaders’ management have pushed back strongly against critics and pointed out with justification that Penney can’t be expected to carry the can. There are many issues contributing to the Crusaders’ decline and sacking the coach likely won’t turn things around.“There’s a real opportunity to be thoughtful and logical and just make sure to get the best out of the group and give them all the support you can,” Crusaders chief executive Colin Mainsbridge said. “When you think logically about it, what are your options?”Sacking the coach is “not a very clever option, no matter how bad things get,” Mainsbridge said. “Unless there’s toxicity or a complete breakdown in trust between players and coaching staff and that’s not the case.”The Crusaders were Super Rugby champions for seven years in a row until their previous head coach Scott Robertson left after the 2023 season to become All Blacks’ head coach. At the same time a number of their senior players or All Blacks left to take up contracts in Japan or France.That hollowing out of a championship team has been exacerbated by long-term injuries to All Black Will Jordan and former Wales international Leigh Halfpenny among others. Others such as captain Scott Barrett, All Blacks Tamaiti Williams, Braydon Ennor and David Havili have been sidelined for shorter periods. Barrett and Havili are due to return against the Rebels.Departures have left the Crusaders to depend on a much less experienced squad than usual. They have struggled particularly to replace All Blacks flyhalf Richie Mo’unga who now is playing in Japan. Rivez Reihana and Riley Hohepa have played in the No. 10 jersey this season.The 35-year-old former All Blacks flyhalf Aaron Cruden revealed this week he was approached by the Crusaders before the season began but he rebuffed them.“I’m not sure if I could have helped down there right now anyway,” Cruden said. “Maybe a little bit of experience. But those young guys getting that exposure, I think they’ll certainly be better for it in that Crusaders 10 jersey.”Mainsbridge agrees that as tough as this season may be, it is building the experience of a new group of Crusaders players.“People forget that a lot of the great players often have inauspicious starts,” he said. “No journey is ever a straight line from new to greatness. For every player to reach their full potential is the same issue. We are absolutely cognizant of that issue and how we build depth and capability there.”Penney has remained optimistic throughout, even after the loss to the Force which was a low point of the season.“There’s a lot of good stuff happening in behind the scenes and I know it doesn’t always appear that way when we’ve had such a topsy-turvy sort of performance and outcome,” he said. “There’s probably three of those games on reflection and possibly four that we could easily have won.”Every game in round 10 will bear to some extent on the playoffs, notably matches between the Wellington-based Hurricanes and ACT Brumbies, the Fijian Drua and Moana Pasifika and the Queensland Reds and Auckland-based Blues.AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby",2024-04-25 05:22:25 AM EEST,NPR,Playoff hopes fading for troubled Crusaders in Super Rugby Pacific,https://apnews.com/article/super-rugby-pacific-18501bcadb19426377925a18ff4d279d
Jay Cohen,"CHICAGO (AP) — Dansby Swanson hit a three-run homer during Chicago’s four-run first inning and the short-handed Cubs beat the Houston Astros 4-3 on Wednesday night.Playing without Cody Bellinger, Chicago used Swanson’s big swing and a solid start by Jameson Taillon to earn its second straight win. It will try to sweep the three-game set against the struggling Astros on Thursday.Taillon (2-0) allowed two runs, one earned, and seven hits in 5 2/3 innings on a chilly evening at Wrigley Field. The right-hander struck out four and walked two in his second start since he began the season on the injured list with a back strain.“Before that back injury, I just really liked where we were at,” Taillon said, “and I feel like we were able to use that downtime as like, let’s stay on the straight and narrow, stay on the right path.”Houston lost for the seventh time in eight games. It has scored a total of 21 runs during the slide.Manager Joe Espada tried to spark his sputtering lineup by moving Alex Bregman into the second spot, between Jose Altuve and Yordan Alvarez. But the Astros went 1 for 10 with runners in scoring position and left 10 runners on base.Altuve opened the ninth with a drive to left against Héctor Neris for his sixth homer. But Neris retired Bregman, Alvarez and Kyle Tucker for his second save in three opportunities.Bellinger was placed on the 10-day injured list with two fractured ribs on his right side. The center fielder got hurt during the series opener Tuesday night.There was no word just yet on a timetable for his return.“The doctors will come up with a plan,” manager Craig Counsell said, “and, like everything, he’s got to get symptom-free first and we’ll go from there.”Nico Hoerner and Ian Happ singled for Chicago in the first against Spencer Arrighetti. Michael Busch delivered a sacrifice fly and Christopher Morel walked before Swanson hit a two-out drive to left for his third homer.The Cubs also got off to a fast start Tuesday night, jumping on the Astros for five runs in the first in a 7-2 victory.“We’ve just been pretty committed to our plans coming in and put some good swings on some balls and that’s just a testament to the work that the guys are doing in the cage,” Swanson said.Arrighetti (0-3) was pulled with two outs in the fourth. The right-hander allowed seven hits, struck out seven and walked two in his third major league start.Astros: LHP Framber Valdez (elbow soreness) threw about 40 pitches during a bullpen session. “He came off the mound feeling good,” Espada said. Valdez remains in line to start this weekend during a two-game series against Colorado in Mexico City. … RHP Cristian Javier (neck discomfort) played catch back in Houston. “The doctor saw him, and it looks like he’s improving,” Espada said.Cubs: RHP Kyle Hendricks is taking pills to help with the inflammation from his low back strain. He also is getting treatment and playing catch to help keep his arm moving. He isn’t too concerned about the injury. “It just made sense to give it the time to settle down, get out of there and give myself a chance to get back to 100 percent,” he said. ... OF Seiya Suzuki (right oblique strain) has resumed baseball activities.Houston right-hander Justin Verlander (1-0, 3.00 ERA) makes his second start since he missed the beginning of the season because of shoulder inflammation.

David Smale,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Alec Marsh and four relievers combined for a six-hitter as the Kansas City Royals beat the Toronto Blue Jays 3-2 Wednesday night.Maikel Garcia and Salvador Perez each had two hits and an RBI for Kansas City, which bounced back from a loss in the series opener on Monday to win two straight.“That’s Royals baseball,” said Bobby Witt Jr., who is batting .350 during a five-game hitting streak. “We’ve got to keep doing that. Get on the base paths. Be aggressive. Make things happen. The bats will come around and (we’ll) hit some homers, too.”John Schreiber (2-0) picked up the win in relief. James McArthur earned his sixth save.“It’s been awesome,” McArthur said. “Those guys coming in early in the game kind of sets the tone for us to come in later. We all have a really good idea of what we’re trying to do in the pen.“The coaches do a great job of giving us good scouting reports, and then we can always rely on (catchers) Salvy (Perez) and Freddy (Fermin). We just try to pass the baton to each other and feed off each other.”Yariel Rodríguez (0-1) gave up three runs on six hits in four innings. He struck out two and walked two.Marsh left the game with one out in the fifth inning after taking a line drive off his right forearm. He fielded the ball and threw out Addison Barger at first, but was removed after that. He gave up no runs on two hits.“We feel like we got pretty lucky,” manager Matt Quatraro said. “It got him in like just above the elbow, on the forearm, but squaring him up. I mean, you could see (the laces) pretty good.“He was saying, ‘Oh, it’s coming back. It’s coming back.’ We’ve got to use our heads there a little bit.”The Royals scored in the first, helped by a couple of walks by Rodriguez. Witt and Vinnie Pasquantino walked with one out, and Perez lined a single to left to score Witt.The Royals added a run in the second. Kyle Isbel hit a two-out double that Barger misplayed into three bases. Barger, who made his debut Wednesday, played right field and third base in Triple-A. He broke in and the ball sailed over his head. Garcia singled, scoring Isbel with the Royals’ second run.The Blue Jays have scored just seven runs in the last three games, two of them 3-2 losses. Toronto manager John Schneider is not worried.“It’s a matter of time,” he said. “You got to keep plugging away. Everyone knows how we’re built, but it takes a game or two to really get rolling. And I think the encouraging part is we are where we are (record-wise) without firing on all cylinders really. So, we’re confident it will turn around.”The Blue Jays got on the board in the fifth when George Springer homered off reliever Angel Zerpa.The Royals chased Rodriguez with three straight singles in the fifth. Witt’s single scored Isbel with KC’s third run.Toronto got an RBI groundout from Ernie Clement to pull within 3-2 in the sixth.Blue Jays: OF Kevin Kiermaier was placed on the 10-day injured list with left hip flexor inflammation. Toronto called up Addison Barger from Triple-A Buffalo to take his place. Barger made his MLB debut in left field and hit eighth in the order.The Blue Jays and Royals will conclude their four-game series Thursday afternoon.

Larry Fleisher,"NEW YORK (AP) — New York Yankees third baseman DJ LeMahieu will be shut down for at least another week after an MRI and CT scan showed continued swelling in his fractured right foot Wednesday.The 35-year-old two-time batting champion underwent testing after leaving his first minor league injury rehabilitation game with Double-A Somerset in the second inning Tuesday night due to soreness in his right foot, which he fractured on a foul ball during a spring training game on March 16.Before exiting his rehab game, LeMahieu was scheduled to play at least four games before potentially joining the Yankees for the opener of a series at Baltimore on Monday.“It’s tough because DJ’s a big part of this team,” slugger Aaron Judge said after New York’s 7-3 win over Oakland. “What he’s been doing the past couple of seasons and to not have him here right now, I know all the guys are feeling it but the most important think is him getting healthy.”LeMahieu hit a career-low .243 last year with 15 homers and 44 RBIs in 136 games. He batted .220 in the first half last, but .273 in the second half.In 2022, he missed the postseason because of a broken sesamoid bone in his right big toe that led to ligament damage in his second toe.“I‘m sure there’s a little bit of frustration in there,” Boone said. “We just want to make sure this is right. I think that’s his mindset. In the last couple of weeks, I know in his mind he felt ready to go.”LeMahieu won the AL batting title by hitting .364 during the pandemic-shortened 2020 season but has hit just .258 in the last three seasons.—AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",2024-04-25 06:07:05 AM EEST,NPR,Yankees third baseman DJ LeMahieu shut down at least another week due to swelling in his right foot,https://apnews.com/article/yankees-lemahieu-broken-foot-dc41817a24ddd5aa4b09d593ec1df578
Kyle Hightower,"BOSTON (AP) — After outscoring the Heat by 42 points from the 3-point line in a 20-point playoff series-opening win, Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla knew Miami would adjust for Game 2.The Heat did, taking a page from how Boston demoralized opponents from beyond the arc throughout the regular season.Miami connected on a franchise playoff record 23 3-pointers, stunning the East’s top-seeded Celtics 111-101 on Wednesday night.Boston, the NBA’s second-best 3-point shooting team, set its own playoff franchise record with 22 3-point makes in Game 1. But, it went just 12 of 32 on Wednesday. The Heat finished 23 of 43, which was also a franchise playoff record for 3s made by a Boston opponent.Tyler Herro led Miami with six 3s, followed by Caleb Martin with five. Six Heat players had at least two triples.While Miami’s volume was up and put pressure on Boston, Mazzulla thought his team did try to make things difficult on the perimeter.“They obviously made a conscious effort to have free reign to shoot more,” Mazzulla said. “I thought most of those were moderately to heavily contested. And so we’re going to have to make the adjustments on some of those.”It didn’t take long to see Miami would be willing to let the ball fly more from the outside.The Heat had eight 3-pointers in the first quarter after connecting on 12 total in Game 1. Of their 19 field goal attempts in the quarter, 15 were 3s. By comparison, Boston had just eight.Miami also had only one 2-point field goal in the period.Boston went to a zone at times, but Miami was efficient, getting to spots on fast breaks before the Celtics could set their defense.“It seemed we couldn’t get them to miss. We thought they were good closeouts. ... But they had a record-breaking night,” Celtics forward Jaylen Brown said.Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said before the game that his team’s volume had to increase because of the Celtics’ 3-point output in Game 1. He didn’t think they’d hold Boston to 25 attempts or shoot 50 themselves.Miami didn’t, but came very close on both numbers.“It always looks better when you make shots,” Spoelstra said. “Those are the ones that are available, and if we don’t take them, it potentially looks a lot like Game 1.”Boston averaged an NBA-high 42.5 attempts per game this season and had 49 in Game 1.Martin, whose hard foul on Jayson Tatum late in Game 1 resulted in a brief face-to-face skirmish with Brown, was showered with boos whenever he touched the ball on Wednesday.He also was one of Miami’s most effective 3-point shooters early, connecting on three in the opening 24 minutes. Herro led the Heat with four 3s in the half.As a team, the Heat went 13 of 24 and trailed 61-58 at halftime. Boston was 8 of 20 from deep in the half, but All-Stars Brown and Jayson Tatum combined for 39 points, going 16 of 27 from field and 5 of 12 from 3.But the Heat stayed hot in the third quarter, going 6 of 9 from distance to take a 85-79 lead into the fourth.“It’s a make-or-miss league. We have to come back and respond for next game,” Brown said.AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA",2024-04-25 05:58:52 AM EEST,NPR,Celtics were beaten at their own game at 3-point line in Game 2 loss to Heat,https://apnews.com/article/celtics-nba-playoffs-23902b950394c8b4a3b2f91103ed2d90
The Associated Press,"ST. LOUIS (AP) — Lars Nootbaar drove in two runs and Kyle Gibson pitched six effective innings, lifting the St. Louis Cardinals to a 5-1 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks in the finale of three-game series on Wednesday.It was the first win in a series finale this season for the Cardinals.In his 299th start, Gibson (2-2) allowed one run and five hits.

He allowed three runs, two earned, and six hits and struck out four and walked one.SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Francisco Lindor hit a pair of two-run homers and the New York Mets avoided a three-game series sweep with a win over San Francisco.Lindor went 4 for 5 with four RBIs and recorded the 16th multi-homer game of his career.Tyrone Taylor homered and added a two-run double, and Jeff McNeil had an RBI single as New York snapped a three-game skid.Tyler Fitzgerald homered for San Francisco, which was seeking its first three-game winning streak of the season.Mets starter Sean Manaea struggled with his command, but battled through 4 2/3 scoreless innings with six strikeouts and four walks. The 32-year-old left-hander allowed four hits, all singles.ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Gunnar Henderson continued his hot streak at the plate with three hits and three RBIs and Baltimore defeated the Los Angeles Angels 6-5 despite Mike Trout becoming the first player in the majors to reach 10 home runs this season.Batting leadoff for the second straight day, Trout got the Angels on the board with a solo shot down the left-field line off Dean Kremer (1-2) in the sixth. It’s the third time in the past seven seasons Trout has been the first in the majors to reach double digits in homers.That began Los Angeles’ rally from being down 6-0 to having the tying run on first with two outs in the ninth.With the Angels trailing 6-4, Ehire Adrianza led off the ninth with an infield single off Orioles closer Craig Kimbrell and advanced to third on second baseman Jorge Mateo’s throwing error. Logan O’Hoppe’s grounder drove him in to get the Angels within a run.Jo Adell drew a walk with two outs, but was caught stealing second to end the game. There was a replay review, but the call stood to give Kimbrell his 424th career save, tied with John Franco for sixth on the all-time list.CLEVELAND (AP) — Connor Wong homered twice and Rafael Devers connected for a homer in his return to Boston’s lineup, sending the banged-up Red Sox to an 8-0 win over the Cleveland Guardians on Wednesday night.Wong hit leadoff homers in the second and sixth innings off Carlos Carrasco (1-2). He added an RBI single in the ninth and had four hits.Devers, who missed the previous five games with a bone bruise in his knee, homered in the fifth as the Red Sox piled up 16 hits and cooled off baseball’s hottest team with a four-hit shutout.Rookie outfielder Wilyer Abreu also had four hits and drove in a run in Boston’s second shutout against Cleveland in a week.PITTSBURGH (AP) — William Contreras had three hits and Milwaukee used one big inning to edge the Pittsburgh.The Brewers took advantage of a sloppy second inning by the Pirates to turn an error, two walks and two hit batters and an RBI single by Contreras into three runs.Sal Frelick had two hits for Milwaukee, which snapped a two-game skid. Bryan Hudson (2-1) worked 1 2/3 innings of scoreless relief. Joel Payamps overcame a pair of errors in the ninth for his third save.Bryan Reynolds hit a two-run homer for Pittsburgh, but the Pirates managed just four hits against five relievers in a bullpen game that favored the Brewers.WASHINGTON (AP) — Shohei Ohtani had three doubles to improve his major league-leading batting average to .371, rookie Landon Knack got his first victory and the Los Angeles Dodgers routed Washington.The Dodgers had a season-high 20 hits en route to their third straight victory, with Mookie Betts and Will Smith each having four hits and Andy Pages homering.Nick Senzel homered for Washington. The Nationals didn’t have a baserunner after the second inning.Ohtani went 3 for 6, hitting RBI doubles in the eighth and ninth innings. He leads the majors in slugging percentage (.695), OPS (1.128), extra-base hits (21) and doubles (14).ST.

With four runs on the board before he took the mound for the first time, Waldron got some much-needed run support after San Diego scored just seven runs in his previous four starts.Robert Suarez picked up his ninth save of the season, retiring the Rockies in order on seven pitches.Ryan McMahon and Elias Díaz each hit solo home runs to center field for Colorado, which left six runners on base, including three in the fourth inning when it had the bases loaded with just one out before a pop-up and groundout ended the threat.ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Adolis García and Evan Carter hit back-to-back home runs in the fourth inning and Texas beat Seattle.García’s team-high seventh homer barely cleared the wall in straight-away center field and tipped off the glove of Julio Rodríguez. García stood near first base apparently thinking Rodríguez made the catch until he saw the center fielder walk toward the infield, turn and look over the fence.Carter hit a triple to drive home García in the seventh in an inning kept alive on an obstruction call at first base against Mariners reliever Austin Voth when Nathaniel Lowe appeared to hit into a 3-6-3 double play.Texas scored twice in the sixth when Jonah Heim singled into the right field corner and Mitch Haniger committed a two-base error.The Mariners Bryce Miller (3-2) gave up the two homers and four hits in four-plus innings.",2024-04-25 06:28:28 AM EEST,NPR,Lars Nootbaar drives in two in a victory over the Diamondbacks,https://apnews.com/sports/baseball-arizona-diamondbacks-new-york-yankees-2075d4985412f3d57063da6b58abe255

Ottawa, with 32 points, now has a three-point lead over Boston with three games to play. Boston has two to play.Emerance Maschmeyer turned away 30 shots, while Brianne Jenner and Gabbie Hughes scored in regulation for Ottawa.Hilary Knight and Jamie Lee Rattray scored for Boston. Aerin Frankel made 22 saves.“Some nights you’re not playing your best hockey, you’re not feeling your best and I think that was actually one of our nights,” Ottawa coach Carla MacLeod said. “But we talked about it. At this time of year, you’ve got to find a way to win and that’s what we’ve been talking about.”Ottawa extended its winning streak to four games and earned its first victory in extra time.“I think we’re in a really good spot and good groove,” said Emily Clark, who had an assist. “I just think that we have such a special group and we got that win together, which I think is a really good sign moving forward.”Trailing 2-1 to start the third, Ottawa got the equalizer at 11:14 of the period when Clark outmuscled Emily Brown on her way to the net and dished a pass through the crease to Hughes, who jammed it in from in close.Jenner had a chance to seal the win in the final minute of regulation but Frankel made a huge save.“Maschmeyer played fantastic and then (Frankel) was going down making the same save at the opposite net,” Boston coach Courtney Kessel said. “Just tremendous goalies across the league and we saw a show tonight by both of them.”Knight opened the scoring 90 seconds into the game on Boston’s first shot. Ottawa lost a faceoff in its own end allowing Hannah Brandt to find Knight in front and she beat Maschmeyer.Ottawa tied the game at 7:43 of the first period after Natalie Snodgrass made a pass through the crease and Jenner backhanded it past Frankel.The Ottawa captain now has nine points (six goals, three assists) in her last four games.A turnover at Ottawa’s blue line gave Rattray, an Ottawa native, a clear break alone and she beat Maschmeyer for her third of the season with less than a minute to play in the first.Boston visits Minnesota on Saturday.Ottawa hosts Montreal on Saturday.AP women’s hockey: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-hockey",2024-04-25 06:52:00 AM EEST,NPR,Katerina Mrazova scores shootout winner and Ottawa beats Boston 3-2,https://apnews.com/article/boston-ottawa-score-d853eeb83b95071cd4239f75a522e394

Seager was attended to by the medical staff after taking first base and remained in the game for the rest of the inning.Rangers manager Bruce Bochy said after Texas’ 5-1 victory that he won’t know Seager’s status for Thursday afternoon’s game until checking on him in the morning.“It swelled up pretty good on the left shin,” Bochy said. “It swelled up really fast, too.”Seager missed most of spring training after having sports hernia surgery Jan. 30.AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",2024-04-25 07:05:25 AM EEST,NPR,"Rangers star Corey Seager hit by pitch, leaves game because of shin contusion",https://apnews.com/article/rangers-corey-seager-e7d7287ecae0a74572ac49aa41c7b7cf
John Coon,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Utah hockey fans welcomed the former Arizona Coyotes to their new home Wednesday.Players and coaches were greeted at the airport in morning by a crowd of approximately 100 players from local youth hockey programs. The kids chanted “Go, Utah! Go, Utah!”The team attended a fan celebration at the Delta Center in the afternoon. The arena was packed for the free event, with many fans turned away at the doors.“We’re 70 people who got traded the same day and we’re going to the same place,” coach André Tourigny said. “I think all of that creates some magic. I think we’ll just be tighter with that. When you want to win championships, you need to go through the trenches together. We went through some trenches this year.”The challenges uprooting from Arizona are tempered by the energetic reception the club has received in the state and a chance to build a new culture.“We’re now a part of history,” player Lawson Crouse said. “Not too many people get to say they can do this. Obviously, the circumstances over the past couple of weeks have been unlike anything out there, but to be here now we feel honored, and we feel blessed and we’re really looking forward to get things rolling here.”Immediate concerns for the team from a logistical standpoint include getting practice facilities and a locker room in place. They plan to make temporary arrangements with community venues for the near future.“We just need ice whether it’s here or it’s at one of the practice rinks,” general manager Bill Armstrong said. “As long as we have ice, we’re good.”Four-time All-Star forward Clayton Keller thinks team can break through and be a playoff team in its debut season in the Beehive State after failing to reach the postseason the last four years in Arizona.“It takes time to learn how to win in this league,” Keller said. “When everyone buys in, I think that’s when you can take some steps and reach that next level.”AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",2024-04-25 05:41:49 AM EEST,NPR,Utah hockey fans welcome the former Arizona Coyotes to their new home,https://apnews.com/article/utah-nhl-coyotes-e8d9822bcdab974c82671266a1789ab5
None,"EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) — Anze Kopitar fired a wrist shot past Stuart Skinner’s glove and into the top corner on a breakaway to give the Los Angeles Kings a 5-4 victory over the Edmonton Oilers on Wednesday night in Game 2 of the first-round playoff series.Playing in his 94th postseason game to tie Luc Robitaille’s franchise record, Kopitar picked up the puck near the Edmonton blue line, moved in and shot from the slot as Oilers defenseman Darnell Nurse dove to try to block the shot.“Honestly, it was kind of a wacky play where Mikey (Anderson) throws it up the boards, and I think it was Q (Quentin Byfield) who tipped it, or was trying to tip it just to prevent the icing,” Kopitar said. “Next thing you know, I had it right on my stick, so I figured I’d make the most of it.”The Los Angeles captain also had two assists to help the Kings — eliminated by the Oilers in the first round the previous two seasons — rebound from a 7-4 loss Monday night in the opener. Game 3 is Friday night in Los Angeles.“To see Kopi get that one at the end, great to see the goal go in, but I can tell you for me personally, and I’m sure the guys, just for a guy that’s done as much as he has, to get another overtime game-winning goal was special,” Kings coach Jim Hiller said. “One game for them, one game for us and now we go to L.A.”Adrian Kempe scored twice in the first period for Los Angeles. Drew Doughty also connected in the first for the Kings, making it 3-1. Kevin Fiala scored in the third, and Cam Talbot made 27 saves.Dylan Holloway scored twice for Edmonton, tying it at 4 early in the third period. Brett Kulak and Zach Hyman also scored for the Oilers, and Skinner stopped 21 shots.“I thought we played a good game and had the puck most of the night,” Oilers defenseman Mattias Ekholm said. “They are going to have their looks and their bounces, but I still liked the way we played and hopefully we can build off of that.”The teams traded goals early in the third. Fiala gave Los Angeles a 4-3 lead at 1:46, and Holloway tied it at 3:23.“We all didn’t feel good about our first game, so we had a lot to prove this game and everyone stepped up their game and Kopi led the way,” said Byfield, who had two assists. “Leaders lead and that’s what we did, we just followed him and it was a lot better.”AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",2024-04-25 09:52:19 AM EEST,NPR,"Anze Kopitar scores in overtime, Kings beat Oilers 5-4 in Game 2 to tie series",https://apnews.com/article/kings-oilers-score-nhl-stanley-cup-864665eafb55267d94f7c6d086ab51b9

Kevin Mcgill,"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — The man who fatally shot retired NFL star Will Smith during a confrontation following a car crash in 2016 is scheduled for sentencing Thursday in a New Orleans courtroom.It’s the second time Cardell Hayes, 36, has faced sentencing in Smith’s death. He was convicted of manslaughter in December 2016 and later sentenced to 25 years. But the jury vote had been 10-2 and the conviction was later tossed after the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed such non-unanimous verdicts.Hayes was released on bond after having served more than four years of the original sentence. He remained free during multiple retrial delays, some due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But he was taken back into custody following the unanimous Jan. 27 verdict and has been awaiting sentencing at the New Orleans jail.Smith was shot eight times — seven times in the back — during a confrontation with Hayes that happened after Hayes’ SUV struck the rear of Smith’s vehicle.Hayes has long said he fired in self-defense. He said he fired only because he believed a drunken and belligerent Smith had retrieved a gun from his SUV. He insisted on the stand that he heard a “pop” before he started shooting and that he did not shoot at Smith’s wife, Racquel, who was hit in the legs.Evidence showed Smith was intoxicated at the time of the confrontation. But there was no witness or forensic evidence to back up Hayes’ claim that Smith had wielded or fired a weapon. At the January retrial, defense attorney John Fuller did not call Hayes to testify, but insisted prosecutors had failed to prove Hayes didn’t fire in self-defense.The overturned verdicts from the 2016 jury also included an attempted manslaughter conviction in the wounding of Racquel Smith. Hayes was acquitted of that charge at January’s second trial.Smith, a 34-year-old father of three, was a defensive leader on the Saints team that lifted spirits in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina devastated the city in 2005. He helped carry the team to a winning season in 2006 and a Super Bowl victory in 2010.Hayes, who owned a tow truck business, once played semi-pro football and is the father of a young son.",2024-04-25 07:01:53 AM EEST,NPR,Man who shot ex-Saints star Will Smith faces sentencing for manslaughter,https://apnews.com/article/retired-nfl-star-will-smith-death-sentencing-145e037ecd307f6ab426e9663b01dccf

Lindsey Bahr,"“Challengers” is a bit of a tease. That’s what makes it fun.There is plenty of skin, sweat, close-ups of muscly thighs and smoldering looks of lust and hate in this deliriously over-the-top psychodrama. But get that image of Josh O’Connor,Zendaya and Mike Faist sitting together on the bed out of your mind. Most of this action takes place on the tennis court.It’s still a sexy tennis movie about friendship, love, competition and sport set to a synth-y score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross — it just might not contain exactly what you think it does. But remember, Luca Guadagnino is the one who filmed Timothée Chalamet with that peach, perhaps more memorable than any actual sex scene from the past decade. Manage expectations, but also trust.And like “Call Me By Your Name” did for Chalamet, “Challengers” is one of those rare original big-screen delights that firmly announces the arrival of a new generation of movie stars. Zendaya and Faist already had a bit of a leg up. She has played significant supporting roles in some of the biggest movies of the past few years, from “Spider-Man” to “Dune,” and he had had his big cinematic breakthrough as Riff in Steven Spielberg’s “West Side Story.” But it’s O’Connor who really comes out on top, effectively shedding any lingering image of him as a whiny, dweeby Prince Charles in seasons three and four of “The Crown.” In “Challengers,” his Patrick Zweig is the cocky, flirty, slightly mean, slightly dirty and slightly broken bad boyfriend of our fictional dreams.Written by playwright Justin Kuritzkes (who is married to “Past Lives” filmmaker Celine Song) “Challengers” is a prickly treat, about fractured relationships, egos, infidelity and ambition. Set during a qualifying match at the New Rochelle Tennis Club, outside New York City, the intricately woven story reveals itself through flashbacks that build to a crescendo in the present-day match.O’Connor’s Patrick and Faist’s Art are old boarding school roommates turned tennis teammates. It’s a relationship that’s at turns brotherly, erotic and competitive. Whatever it is, they are definitely too close and not remotely prepared for Zendaya’s Tashi Duncan to enter the mix.Tashi, in high school, is well on her way to becoming the next big tennis superstar. Art and Patrick watch her play, mouths agape at her technical form and physical beauty. Later, they both ask for her number, leading to a revealing night in a grungy hotel room. She promises her number to the one who wins the singles match the next day. Tashi just wants to see some good tennis, she says, but she also knows how to motivate and manipulate.Because of the fractured timeline, we know that Tashi in the present day does not play tennis anymore. She was injured at some point and never recovered, unlike her husband, Art, who is now one of the most famous players in the world. The two of them are wildly wealthy, living in a ritzy hotel and fronting Aston Martin ad campaigns. At night, Tashi uses Augustinus Bader cream to moisturize her legs. Guadagnino, who likes to wink at and luxuriate in wealth signifiers, enlisted JW Anderson designer Jonathan Anderson to do the costumes, which will surely populate summer style inspiration boards the way his “A Bigger Splash” and “Call Me By Your Name” have in the past.But while they are technically at the top, Art is also on a losing streak, so Tashi sends him to a low-stakes tournament where he can get his confidence back. That’s where they encounter Patrick, who has not been so fortunate over the years and who has fallen out with his old friends. Of course, it’s all building to Patrick and Art playing one another in the final match, a part of which is so wildly and comically drawn out that you can almost envision the “Saturday Night Live” spoof.“Challengers” is a drama, but a funny and self-aware one. It doesn’t take itself very seriously and has a lot of fun with its characters, all three of which are anti-heroes in a way. You might have a favorite, but you’re probably not rooting for anyone exactly — just glued to the screen to see how it all plays out on and off the court.“Challengers,” an MGM release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for “language throughout, some sexual content and graphic nudity.” Running time: 131 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.",2024-04-24 00:01:40 AM EEST,NPR,"Movie Review: Prepare to get hot and bothered with stylish, synthy tennis drama ‘Challengers’",https://apnews.com/article/challengers-movie-review-zendaya-cec4315880486ff93454e22bc14b7d6c
Tales Azzoni,"MADRID (AP) — Rafael Nadal will play in the Madrid Open despite not being fully fit and didn’t seem too optimistic about his chances of being ready for the French Open next month.The 37-year-old Nadal said Wednesday he would not play in Paris if he arrives there feeling the same way that he is feeling ahead of his opening match in Madrid this week.“The sensations haven’t been perfect this week. If it wasn’t Madrid, maybe I wouldn’t play. But there are a lot of emotions involved,” Nadal said. “I don’t know what’s going to happen in the following three weeks. I’ll keep fighting and doing the things that I think I need to do to play in Paris. And if it’s possible, then it’s possible. If not, then not. I’m not going to play in Paris the way I’m feeling today. It it was Paris, I wouldn’t be playing.”Nadal has said this is likely his farewell year on tour, and is hoping to be competitive one last time at Roland Garros, where he is a 14-time champion.The 22-time Grand Slam champion has won a record five times in Madrid, with his last title in the Spanish capital coming in 2017. He is scheduled to debut on Thursday against 16-year-old American Darwin Blanch.“Hopefully I can play without many limitations,” Nadal said. “Then we’ll see what happens. If I play without limitations, even if I lose, then it will be positive.”Nadal, who had hip surgery last summer, lost to Alex de Minaur in the second round in Barcelona in what was his first tournament in more than three months.“The goal is be on court. Enjoy as long as possible,” he said. “I mean, that’s the thing. Try to finish the tournament alive in terms of body issues, and enjoy the fact that I will be able to compete one more time in the professional tour and here at home in Madrid, a place that give me everything, no, in terms of support.”He said he is giving himself “a chance” and hopes to “find better feelings” in his body going forward.“I don’t lose hope. I just accept the situation that I have today,” Nadal said. “I mean, I am not playing bad. It’s about more body limitations. ...

James Ellingworth,"LEVERKUSEN, Germany (AP) — Jonathan Tah is already a German champion with Bayer Leverkusen. He’s hungry for more titles.Tah could yet complete a treble this season in the Europa League — where Leverkusen plays Roma in the semifinals next week — and in the German Cup. Then there’s the European Championship with Germany, for which Tah has become a regular starter in central defense alongside Real Madrid’s Antonio Rüdiger.Leverkusen’s players and coach Xabi Alonso — who Tah showered with beer during their title celebrations — aren’t satisfied just with bringing the long-awaited first league title to a club once derided as “Neverkusen” for its near misses.“This trophy gave us so much positive energy. To have that feeling to win a trophy, the hunger gets even bigger and that’s why we keep our level high,” Tah tells The Associated Press. “One trophy is nice but there’s still more to achieve, so that’s why we keep pushing ourselves.”Including the home game with Stuttgart on Saturday, Leverkusen is four games away from being the first German team to go unbeaten all season in the Bundesliga.Tah and the rest of the defense have conceded in 30 league games just 20 goals — 17 fewer than Bayern Munich — and going unbeaten would be their crowning achievement.“That means something for us because that’s never happened before,” Tah said. “We are racing ourselves because we are already Bundesliga champions. But that’s our own challenge now that we are playing for, and that’s why we want to keep that momentum and keep winning.”Tah has been with Leverkusen since 2015 and is the club’s second longest serving player. In that time, “the expectations of the club evolved” and Alonso has forged a competitive mindset, even in training, and rock-solid team spirit, Tah said.“He’s expecting to win every game, no matter against who we play. He’s never scared. He always wants to win games and that’s his mindset,” Tah said of Alonso. Having a coach who won the World Cup and Champions League as a player opens up new possibilities in training. Clips from Alonso’s sessions with Leverkusen have often gone viral as the coach casually plays pinpoint long passes or shows off his skills.“He can show you what he wants to see from you and actually sometimes it’s really impressive how good his level still is,” Tah said. “I don’t want to take away (from) his tactical understanding and explaining the team on the (tactics) board and stuff like that, because he’s good at that as well, but of course he’s Xabi Alonso. He was a big player. He won everything. And if he explains something to you and shows it to you, it is different than a coach who has never played for a club before.”Leverkusen’s historic season will end with the German Cup final against Kaiserslautern on May 25 in Berlin. That comes three days after a potential Europa League final against Atalanta or Marseille in Dublin.Tah’s unlikely to get much rest after that. His performances with Leverkusen have helped to kick-start what had been a stop-start career with Germany. He’s played every minute of Germany’s last seven games, including every game since Julian Nagelsmann was appointed coach.Tah believes Leverkusen’s winning mindset could help Germany, too.“That’s my part,” he said, “to bring that energy and that mindset that we have here in Leverkusen right now to the national team and try to do my best to support the team, so that we can be successful.”AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",2024-04-25 12:22:40 PM EEST,NPR,Leverkusen defender Jonathan Tah looks to finish historic season unbeaten and with more trophies,https://apnews.com/article/tah-leverkusen-bundesliga-preview-c17acb51382045d94d28cb2ba431b652

(AP) — Erik Jones suffered a compression fracture in a lower vertebra in a wreck at Talladega and will not drive this weekend in the NASCAR Cup series race at Dover Motor Speedway.Corey Heim will substitute for Jones in the No. 43 Toyota for Legacy Motor Club.There is no timeline for Jones’ return. He will still attend Sunday’s Cup race at the Monster Mile.The 27-year-old Jones has one top-10 finish in 10 races this season and is 20th in the points standings.

Paul Newberry,"TALLADEGA, Ala. (AP) — Suddenly, Michael Jordan’s new life seems just as satisfying as his old one. This felt a whole lot like M.J. knocking down a buzzer beater, winning the big game, celebrating like a champion.Of course, his title-hoarding days in the NBA are long behind him.But Jordan’s current passion is filling that competitive void.For the first time since he became a NASCAR Cup team owner, Jordan was at the track to savor in person a victory by one of his drivers.And what a win it was.When Michael McDowell crashed with the finish line in sight at Talladega Superspeedway, losing control in a desperate effort to block another driver from passing him, Tyler Reddick sped right on by to steal the checkered flag Sunday.Not unlike all those times Jordan sank an improbable shot to win the game for the Chicago Bulls.“To me, this is like an NBA playoff game,” said Jordan, who co-owns the 23XI team with Denny Hamlin. “And for us to win a big race like this, it means so much to me. I’m all in. I love it.”The winning driver didn’t even realize Jordan was at the track — he’s always rather low-key and apparently didn’t want to put any extra pressure on his drivers, Reddick and Bubba Wallace — but it sure made the occasion even more special.When Reddick got to victory lane, he was greeted by his boss, who had scooped up Reddick’s 4-year-old son, Beau, on pit road.“In the moment it means a lot, but as he gets older and everything, too, looking back on that, that’s going to be really, really cool moment,” said Reddick, who is in his second season with 23XI.Beau knows who his daddy’s boss is, but more for the sneakers he made so famous. Reddick plans to rectify that in the years ahead.“I’ve got to probably play some highlights, some (NBA) Finals matchups, and educate Beau a little bit better,” Reddick said. “Play some old-school games for him so he can get a real good feel of how dominant (Jordan) was in his prime.”It was undoubtedly a big moment for NASCAR, which has endured some dips in popularity but seems on the upswing again.Judging by the reaction on social media at seeing His Airness celebrating wildly in the pits, like he once did on the court, Reddick’s victory is sure to move the needle even more. For good measure, the No. 45 Toyota was adorned with the Basketball Hall of Famer’s iconic “Jumpman” logo.“Yeah, 23XI is very important to this sport, absolutely,” Hamlin said. “It’s good for everything you can imagine. You’re talking sponsorship, your manufacturers, your team morale. It’s just so good, and it is in so many different ways.”Always one to deliver a well-timed verbal jab, Jordan couldn’t resist taking a poke at his co-owner, who drives for Joe Gibbs Racing and was knocked out by a crash with 33 laps remaining that also took out Wallace.“Actually, he did a good job of wrecking, so we could get up front,” Jordan said of Hamlin. “That was actually pretty good.”McDowell started from the pole, dominated the later laps and was in position to give Ford its much-needed first victory of the year. But his desperate efforts to block Brad Keselowski, another Ford driver, wound up costing them both.McDowell swerved to thwart Keselowski on the high side of the track, only to lose control when he attempted an even bolder block to cut off his challenger darting to the inside. McDowell went into a spin, Keselowski had to check up and Reddick sped by to claim his sixth career Cup victory by 0.208 seconds while a bunch of other cars crashed behind them.Corey LaJoie slid across the finish line with his No. 7 machine on its side, pinned by another car against the wall in front of the grandstands.Having Jordan witness the improbable finish with his own eyes only added to Reddick’s jubilation.“He’s come to a few races, and unfortunately, even as good as the days have looked, they’ve not ended in victory lane,” Reddick said. “So for us to win a race like that, be up front as much as we were at the end and it looked like it was slipping away, and then we get it back, man, it’s an unreal feeling.”For Jordan, the wild finish sparked memories of his former life, the one where he won six NBA championships and was always at his best with the game on the line.Yet make no mistake: The 61-year-old Jordan is fully committed these days to stock car racing.“It replaces a lot of the competitiveness that I had in basketball,” he said, before quickly adding a caveat. “But this is even worse, because I have no control. If I was playing basketball, I’d have total control. But I have no control, so I live vicariously through the drivers, crew chiefs and everybody.”On a wild Sunday in east Alabama, that was more than enough for M.J.This story has been corrected to show that Reddick is in his second, not first, season driving for 23XI.AP NASCAR: https://apnews.com/hub/nascar-racing",2024-04-22 18:52:53 PM EEST,NPR,NASCAR revels in an M.J. moment.

Rob Maaddi,"DETROIT (AP) — Jayden Daniels handled the media with the same poise and command he displays in the pocket.Asked a few times about speculation that he doesn’t want to play for Washington and whether he prefers going to another team, Daniels understandably took a diplomatic approach one day before the NFL draft.“I’m blessed to go wherever I’m called,” Daniels said Wednesday. “Whoever calls my phone, whoever gives the card to the Commissioner that says my name, I’m blessed to go and they’re gonna get my all.”Pressed further about the Commanders and asked if he’d be OK going there, Daniels replied: “100%”The 2023 Heisman Trophy winner from LSU is expected to be one of the top three players selected Thursday night. After USC quarterback Caleb Williams goes to Chicago first overall, Daniels is the odds-on favorite to be the No. 2 pick, according to BetMGM Sportsbook.The Commanders need a franchise QB and will have their choice of Daniels, North Carolina’s Drake Maye or Michigan’s J.J. McCarthy. The team took an unorthodox approach during its pre-draft visits and hosted all of them together along with several other prospects for a Topgolf outing.Reports that Daniels’ agent, Ron Butler, wasn’t pleased with the visit led to his client answering questions about it 33 hours before the Commanders are on the clock.“I just had fun with the other guys just being able to interact with people throughout the process. It was cool,” Daniels said, adding that he’s not a golfer but is starting to learn the sport.Teams typically want to maximize their time with a player ahead of the draft so Washington faced criticism for its decision to host a group visit.Daniels downplayed having any issues with it.“I spent quite some time with them,” Daniels said. “Obviously, Zoom meetings prior and the combine and when I got up there I spent some time with them but I had other places to go so I had to catch a flight but overall just a good visit.”New Commanders coach Dan Quinn hired former Cardinals coach Kliff Kingsbury to be the offensive coordinator. Kingsbury had some success with dual-threat QB Kyler Murray in Arizona and previously with Patrick Mahomes and Johnny Manziel in college.“Obviously, his track record with mobile quarterbacks speaks for itself,” Daniels said. “I’ve been familiar with Kliff.”Daniels has a strong relationship with Raiders coach Antonio Pierce, who was an assistant at Arizona State when he played there before transferring to LSU.Las Vegas would have to trade up from No. 13 to get Daniels.“I’ve known AP since I was a teenager, so obviously our relationship off the field meant a lot,” Daniels said. “We’ll see what happens but I’m blessed to go wherever I’m called.”Daniels, Williams and Maye are among 13 players in town for the draft. They participated in a football clinic with Special Olympics Michigan athletes on a cold, blustery morning in a ballpark that used to be the site of old Tigers Stadium.Williams had a big smile throughout the event. He tossed five straight touchdown passes to youngsters at one point. Prospects played catch, ran routes, gave tips and interacted with the youth for an hour on the field before a 30-minute session with reporters.“I had a blast,” Williams said. “They seemed to have a great time. It was really enjoyable for me.

They had until May 2 to decide whether or not to exercise a fifth-year option.Bateman, drafted 27th overall, instead became the first first-round wide receiver to sign a second contract with the Ravens.“Congratulations to ‘Bate’ and his family,” Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta said in a statement. “This is a good day for the Ravens.”Bateman has 93 catches and four touchdowns in three seasons.His first two seasons were shortened by injuries that caused him to play only 18 games.

Doug Ferguson,"HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C. (AP) — Golf went a decade without being able to identify a dominant player. And then within the last month, the sport suddenly has two of them.Scottie Scheffler won his first PGA Tour event in the Phoenix Open two years ago and now he has 10 tour titles, two of them at the Masters.Not only is he the No. 1 player in the world, he has double the average points of the next player, Rory McIlroy. That hasn’t happened since Tiger Woods doubled the world ranking lead over Phil Mickelson toward the end of 2009.Nelly Korda went through 2023 without winning on the LPGA Tour — her only title was the Aramco Series in London on the Ladies European Tour — and ended the year at No. 5 in the women’s world ranking. Now she is in the LPGA record book with five straight victories and is close to having double the points average of Lilia Vu, who won two majors last year.It all seems to have happened so quickly, except that it really hasn’t.Korda possesses all the traits of a star.She has the athletic genes — an older sister (Jessica) on the LPGA Tour, a younger brother (Sebastian) who is No. 26 in the world in tennis, a father (Petr) who won his lone Grand Slam event in tennis at the 1998 Australian Open.Her swing is so pure that even the late Mickey Wright, regarded as the greatest LPGA player, took notice in a 2017 Golf Digest interview. That was a year before Korda won the first of her 13 LPGA titles.Korda first rose to No. 1 when she captured the Women’s PGA Championship at Atlanta Athletic Club in 2021, and then won the Olympic gold medal in Japan. What she lost was momentum — surgery for a blood clot in her left arm that cost her four months in 2022, and then a back injury in the late spring of 2023 that cost her a month.She exudes a cool demeanor, ruthless at times, and her quiet toughness is a good fit with swing coach Jamie Mulligan. He says Korda has “shooter’s adrenaline,” a basketball reference.“If the mind is quiet, even if your heart is going, you can get yourself in the right spot,” Mulligan said.Now she is fully fit and listening to her body. Korda won before a home crowd in Bradenton, Florida, skipped the entire Asia swing, returned after seven weeks off and won four in a row.Her victory at the Chevron Championship, her fifth straight win to tie the LPGA record, never looked in doubt. It was surprising to hear Korda talk about the grind, her nerves and that she felt “sick to my stomach.” No telling how the rest of tour must feel.“I think there’s a key in the simplicity that I have when I play,” Korda said. “I honestly just take it a shot at a time, and we pick a game plan when we get to the golf course and we work and we stay in our own little bubble. It’s been working so far.”That’s how Scheffler makes it look.He picks a target. He swings the club. It goes where he’s looking.No one is better from tee to green, which can make his putting seem worse than it really is. He got into some bad habits last year that made the putter look like a piece of Kryptonite at the end of a shaft. That has been sorted out. And that’s frightening for the rest of golf.When he polished off his latest clinic Monday morning in the rain-delayed RBC Heritage, Scheffler was asked about the worst shot he hit in the final round.It stumped him. Scheffler finally settled on a 3-wood he tugged off the tee on the eighth hole. It just trickled into the left rough.But that was the point of the question. He never seems to miss.“I didn’t know what you were getting at there,” he said with a laugh. “And I was thinking through my shots and I was like ... yeah, I felt like I hit a lot of quality shots, and the ball was coming out of the face. It seemed like if a shot didn’t end up where I wanted it to, it was probably just a little gust of wind.”Korda and Scheffler will disappear now for a few weeks.Korda withdrew from the JM Eagle LA Championship on Monday — probably a smart move for her and the long year ahead, brutal for the LPGA just when it was poised to create room on the Nelly bandwagon — and is not expected back until May 9 for the Cognizant Founders Cup in New Jersey.Scheffler said he will not be back until the PGA Championship on May 16-19. His wife, Meredith, is expecting to give birth to their first child by the end of the month.Scheffler is approaching a full year at No. 1 in the world, a rarity in men’s golf. Dustin Johnson (64 weeks) and McIlroy (54 weeks) are the only ones to have done that post-Woods. After that first victory, it took Scheffler only 50 tournaments to get the next nine.This form didn’t just show up overnight. It just seems that way because of his putting funk.“I was No. 1 in the world for a long time last year,” Scheffler said. “But I was never answering questions like, ‘Hey, you’ve been playing so great.’ It was more like, ‘Hey, you’ve been playing great, BUT you’ve been doing this one thing really, really bad.’”He laughed, because laughter comes easily to Scheffler. So does winning.A previous version of this article reported incorrectly that Tiger Woods last doubled the world ranking lead over Phil Mickelson in 2008.AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",2024-04-24 01:57:47 AM EEST,NPR,Analysis: Golf has two dominant forces in Scheffler and Korda.

Doug Ferguson,"A plan is in place for Rory McIlroy to rejoin the PGA Tour board, a move that would require the board’s approval and could be viewed as a chance to help to improve stalled negotiations with the Saudi financial backers of LIV Golf.McIlroy resigned from the board in November, saying he felt he could no longer commit the time and energy required with the PGA Tour trying to finalize an agreement with the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia.The deal with PIF was not finalized, and the PGA Tour instead took on Strategic Sports Group as a minority investor in a deal that could be worth as much as $3 billion.Webb Simpson, one of the six player directors on the PGA Tour board and PGA Tour Enterprises board, has submitted a letter saying that he wants to resign as a player director but only if McIlroy replaces him, according to a person who has seen the letter.The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Tuesday because the letter was not made public. The board is expected to discuss Simpson’s request as early as Wednesday.PGA Tour Enterprises is the new commercial entity, though six players serve on both boards.McIlroy’s resignation in November required the other five player directors — Simpson, Tiger Woods, Patrick Cantlay, Adam Scott and Peter Malnati — to elect a player to serve out the term through 2024. They chose Jordan Spieth.Some of those players have been at odds with McIlroy over the last few months because the four-time major champion has changed his tune about LIV Golf and has suggested LIV players be allowed to return to the PGA Tour without penalty.Spieth and McIlroy disagreed in February over Spieth’s comments that a deal with PIF was not needed because of the SSG investment, although it would help with unification.The Simpson case, however, is different. He has not resigned from the board. The person said Simpson’s letter said he would resign if McIlroy could replace him; otherwise, he would stay on the boards.The person said Simpson indicated the board currently does not have a European player — five are Americans and Scott is Australian.SSG in a consortium of American sports owners, led by the Fenway Group, and McIlroy has an affiliation with Fenway through the new TGL team league due to start play in January.The Guardian, which first reported McIlroy’s potential move back to the board, also noted McIlroy has a good relationship with Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the PIF governor.Al-Rumayyan met with the player directors — he even played nine holes with Woods — in the Bahamas a week after The Players Championship last month. Spieth described that meeting as a chance to talk while figuring out the next step.There have been no reports of progress since then.A London financial newspaper, City A.M., reported last week that LIV had offered McIlroy $850 million to join, based on sources it did not identify. McIlroy quickly shot down those rumors and said he would play the PGA Tour “for the rest of my career.” But he also reiterated his hopes that golf could be unified again outside the four majors.“The game is better when we’re all together,” he said last week at the RBC Heritage.The hurdle for any kind of a deal has been how to unify the game. Jon Rahm, Brooks Koepka, Bryson DeChambeau and Dustin Johnson are among players who signed bonuses said to be worth upward of $100 million that led to the divide.McIlroy said last month at The Players Championship that Al-Rumayyan “wants to do the right thing” for all of golf and that LIV Commissioner Greg Norman and others have done the PIF leader a disservice.“So the closer that we can get to Yasir, PIF and hopefully finalize that investment, I think that will be a really good thing,” McIlroy said.SSG’s initial investment of $1.5 billion is for a first-of-its-kind equity ownership program. PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan said in a February memo that $750 million in aggregate equity would be granted to 36 players based on career performance, last five-year performance and Player Impact Program results.Those players are to learn details of how much they receive this week.AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",2024-04-23 22:57:19 PM EEST,NPR,"Webb Simpson offers to resign from PGA Tour board.

Jenna Fryer,"Team Penske was dealt a humiliating disqualification Wednesday when reigning Indianapolis 500 winner Josef Newgarden was stripped of his victory in the IndyCar season-opening race for manipulating his push-to-pass system.Penske teammate Scott McLaughlin, who finished third in the opener on the downtown streets of St. Petersburg, Florida, was also disqualified. Will Power, who finished fourth at St. Pete, was not disqualified, but docked 10 points.Additionally, all three Penske entries were fined $25,000 and forfeited all prize money associated with the race. Power has not been accused of any wrongdoing.Roger Penske owns the race team, the IndyCar Series and Indianapolis Motor Speedway, host of the Indy 500.“Very disappointing,” Penske said in a text message to The Associated Press. “I am embarrassed.”The reverberations were immediate throughout the paddock.“I’ve emulated Roger Penske for many years on and off the track, so today’s news is quite a disappointment for me,” rival team owner Chip Ganassi told the AP. “This is a blemish on his team, their organization, and the series. Very disappointing as a fellow owner and competitor in the series.”The disqualifications gave the victory to Pato O’Ward, who finished second. It is the first win for McLaren’s IndyCar team since 2022.Although Newgarden is accused of cheating in the March 10 opener, IndyCar said the manipulation wasn’t discovered until Sunday morning’s warmup in Long Beach, California — nearly two months later.“The integrity of the IndyCar Series championship is critical to everything we do,” IndyCar President Jay Frye said. “While the violation went undetected at St. Petersburg, IndyCar discovered the manipulation during Sunday’s warmup in Long Beach and immediately addressed it ensuring all cars were compliant for the Acura Grand Prix of Long Beach.“Beginning with this week’s race at Barber Motorsports Park, new technical inspection procedures will be in place to deter this violation.”A review of the data from the St. Petersburg race showed that Team Penske manipulated the overtake system so the three Penske drivers could use push-to-pass on starts and restarts. According to IndyCar rules, the use of the overtake isn’t available until the car reaches the alternate start-finish line.Team Penske President Tim Cindric said in a statement that the “push-to-pass software was not removed as it should have been, following recently completed hybrid testing in the Team Penske Indy cars.”“This software allowed for push-to-pass to be deployed during restarts at the St. Petersburg Grand Prix race, when it should not have been permitted,” Cindric continued. “The No. 2 car driven by Josef Newgarden and the No. 3 car driven by Scott McLaughlin, both deployed push-to-pass on a restart, which violated IndyCar rules. Team Penske accepts the penalties applied by IndyCar.”Newgarden, a two-time IndyCar champion and reigning Indianapolis 500 winner who is in a contract year with Penske, fell from first in points to 11th with the disqualification. Ganassi driver Scott Dixon, winner Sunday at Long Beach, is now the points leader headed into Sunday’s race at Barber Motorsports Park in Alabama.McLaughlin, in a lengthy statement posted Wednesday night on social media, said he was unaware of the glitch in the software and used “a single, very brief, (1.9 second) deployment” of push-to-pash in a routine part of the circuit.“I hit the button out of habit, but I did not pass any cars nor did I gain any time advantage,” he said. “The data, which IndyCar has, confirms all of this information. While I accept the the penalty, I want to be clear that I did not gain an advantage over my competitors.“A mistake was made,” McLaughlin said. “I have the highest level of integrity and it is important to protect both my own reputation and that of the team.”It’s the second cheating offense this season for Team Penske. Joey Logano was fined $10,000 and docked his second-place starting position for a NASCAR race at Atlanta earlier this season because he was wearing an illegal glove during his qualifying run.It is assumed that Logano wore the same illegal glove — which had clear aerodynamic-deflecting alterations that made it look as if he was wearing part of an amphibious costume — when he won the pole for the Daytona 500 one week earlier.The black glove for Logano’s left hand had webbing made of an unspecified material in between every finger. The theory was that Team Penske had the glove altered in order for Logano to place his hand out his window as an aerodynamic blocker during qualifying.Penske was livid after the Logano infractions.“I didn’t like that at all,” Penske told the AP at the time. “It’s not good. Period. I told him. He’s the leader of the team. Look, we are under so much scrutiny and the last thing we need to do is have any noise like that. It’s not good for us. It’s not good for him. We’ll take our punches.”AP IndyCar: https://apnews.com/hub/indycar",2024-04-25 03:44:37 AM EEST,NPR,Josef Newgarden stripped of season-opening IndyCar victory for manipulating push-to-pass system,https://apnews.com/article/newgarden-disqualified-indycar-3c0c4b91f1e377f4dfa7359f93e95102
Aaron Beard,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Tony DeAngelo found himself playing a reduced role in his second stint with the Carolina Hurricanes amid a deep roster of defensemen. He could be headed for a larger role in the NHL playoffs with veteran Brett Pesce sidelined by injury.DeAngelo worked in a pairing with Brady Skjei during practice Wednesday before the Hurricanes traveled north ahead of Game 3 against the New York Islanders on Thursday. Coach Rod Brind’Amour said Pesce is “more than likely” out for the remainder of the first-round series because of a lower-body injury suffered on a noncontact sequence during the second period of a Game 2 comeback win Monday.DeAngelo has been a healthy scratch for the first two postseason games, with the Hurricanes claiming both for a 2-0 series lead.“It’s always tough, but it is what it is,” he said of the limited playing role. “Now we’ve got a chance that I can come in and help out and hopefully make a difference.”It’s a different role this time around for DeAngelo compared with his first stint, when he signed for the 2021-22 season on a low-risk flier deal in search of a fresh start after a troubled end to his tenure with the New York Rangers. He went on to work in the top pairing with Jaccob Slavin in those playoffs, filling the void when Dougie Hamilton signed with New Jersey as an offensive threat and key piece to the power play.But Carolina traded him to Philadelphia after that season, then re-signed him last summer after the Flyers placed DeAngelo on unconditional waivers.This time, though, he’s been a fill-in after the Hurricanes’ strong top six, which typically has Slavin working with Brent Burns at the top, the Pesce-Skjei combination and last summer’s signing, Dmitry Orlov, paired with Jalen Chatfield.“He makes the pairing good just with his skating and the way he defends,” DeAngelo said of Skjei, adding it was similar to playing with Slavin.Skjei, meanwhile, sees some clear upside in the match, too.“Get him the puck in the (offensive) zone,” Skjei said. “That’s his biggest strength, obviously. We all know how gifted offensively he is.”DeAngelo played well in his first stint in Carolina, with 10 goals and 41 assists in the 2022 regular season, then he had one goal and nine assists in 14 postseason games in 2022 while averaging 21:31 of ice time. But DeAngelo has appeared in just 11 of 45 games since the start of 2024, averaging 13:33 of ice time in those outings.Brind’Amour said the elevated role is “nothing new to him” on a veteran team playing in the playoffs for the sixth straight season.“He’s been here before, we had him for a whole year, I think he played almost every game,” Brind’Amour said. “We know what we’ve got in that player, that’s why we went and got him. It was just unfortunate he didn’t get to play much this year because we were healthy. But this is exactly why you want a guy like that around.”AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",2024-04-24 23:05:10 PM EEST,NPR,Pesce’s injury could mean a larger role for DeAngelo in the playoffs for the Hurricanes,https://apnews.com/article/nhl-playoffs-carolina-hurricanes-tony-deangelo-54841c3f4aab9ac2f27eda3e1bde627b
Andrew Seligman,"CHICAGO (AP) — The Chicago Bears unveiled a nearly $5 billion proposal Wednesday for an enclosed stadium next door to their current home at Soldier Field as part of a major project that would transform the city’s lakefront, and they are asking for public funding to help make it happen.The plan calls for $3.2 billion for the new stadium plus an additional $1.5 billion in infrastructure. The team and the city said the project would add green and open space while improving access to the city’s Museum Campus and could also include a publicly owned hotel.“This is not an easy project, but Chicago doesn’t like it easy,” Bears president Kevin Warren said.The announcement at Soldier Field comes during a busy week for the Bears. They are expected to take 2022 Heisman Trophy winner Caleb Williams with the No. 1 pick in the draft on Thursday night and bank on the USC quarterback to solidify a position that has long been a sore spot for the founding NFL franchise.The team said last month it was prepared to provide more than $2 billion in funding toward a publicly owned stadium in the city.The proposal calls for $2.025 billion from the Bears, $300 million from an NFL loan and $900 million in bonds from the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority. The funding from the ISFA would involve extending bonds of the existing 2% hotel tax.The Bears said the project would generate $8 billion in economic impact for the region. It would be built in three phases and take up to five years. The new stadium would be constructed on a parking lot just south of Soldier Field, the Bears’ home since 1971. The team’s lease at the 100-year-old stadium runs through 2033.Mayor Brandon Johnson gave a full-throated endorsement, saying the project is in line with Daniel Burnham’s “Plan of Chicago.” He said there would be no tax hikes or new taxes for Chicago residents.Renderings show the Bears’ stadium would have a translucent roof and massive glass panels that would bring in sunlight and allow for views of Chicago’s famed skyline. The plan is to host major concerts throughout the year as well as Super Bowls, Final Fours and Big Ten championship games.Though Soldier Field’s famed colonnades would be preserved, the spaceship-like stadium that was installed in the renovation two decades ago would be torn out and replaced by playing fields as well as park space. The plan calls for a pedestrian mall, food and beverage options, a promenade and plaza.“My administration insisted that any new project — especially one on public land — must deliver strong public benefit and public use for the City of Chicago, and I am pleased today that this plan does exactly that,” Johnson said.Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, however, said he wasn’t on board.“I remain skeptical about this proposal and I wonder whether it’s a good deal for the taxpayers,” Pritzker told reporters Wednesday at an unrelated news conference. “I’m not sure this is among the highest priorities for taxpayers.”Illinois’ top legislative leaders were also doubtful.“If we were to put this issue on the board for a vote right now, it would fail and it would fail miserably,” Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch said at an unrelated news conference. “There is no environment for something like this today.”However, he added that the environment in Springfield does change.The proposal comes as two other Chicago sports teams, including the White Sox and Red Stars, have expressed interest in public funding for new stadiums.Warren, who replaced the retired Ted Phillips a year ago, played a role in the construction of U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis through a public-private partnership when he worked in the Minnesota Vikings’ front office from 2005 to 2019.The Bears spent $197.2 million more than a year ago to purchase the site of the shuttered Arlington International Racecourse from Churchill Downs Inc. They envisioned building a stadium on the 326-acre tract of land some 30 miles northwest of Soldier Field, with restaurants, retail and more on the property — all for about $5 billion, with some taxpayer help.The Bears had said they would pay for the stadium in Arlington Heights, with taxpayer dollars covering infrastructure costs such as roads and sewers. Those plans stalled, with the team citing a property assessment it said was too high.They would remain tenants by staying in Chicago rather than owning a stadium in Arlington Heights. But Warren said he sees it as more of a partnership with the city rather than a landlord-tenant relationship.“I believe in Mayor Johnson,” Warren said. “I believe in his staff, his vision, I believe in this city. I don’t look at it as being a renter. I look at it as being able to develop a relationship, to be able to come together. People asked that same question in Minnesota — why would you want to be a renter?”Associated Press reporter Sophia Tareen in Chicago contributed to this report. ___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",2024-04-25 00:47:20 AM EEST,NPR,Bears unveil $5 billion plan for lakefront stadium and seek public funding to make it happen,https://apnews.com/article/chicago-bears-lakefront-stadium-41e753652af49a9c1435811319f040f1
Doug Ferguson,"HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C. (AP) — The left wrist injury Jordan Spieth first suffered a week before the PGA Championship last year hasn’t gone away.That doesn’t necessarily means it’s worse — or better.“It’s a come-and-go thing,” Spieth said last week after his pro-am round at the RBC Heritage. “I could oddly enough twist in the wrong way getting off the ground, and I couldn’t play tomorrow. But I could play the next day.”Spieth said the tendon sheath is torn enough that it won’t hold the tendon perfectly in place. He said he could lift a 20-pound weight without any issue. But then something small, like placing his hand on the counter to pick something up, could trigger it.It was fine when he started the first round Thursday. He had it taped up Friday and went without the next day.Spieth doesn’t expect any changes to his schedule, though he has one eye on the offseason to figure out what to do.“It’s not really a surgical thing, it’s a rest thing,” he said. “From who I’ve talked to in other sports, the ulnar side of the wrist is hard to heal.”Spieth said he saw a hand specialist last offseason and had imaging done, and he has yet to solve the issue.“When it pops up, instead of me being out for a month, I’m out for a day,” he said.One way to measure how much Scottie Scheffler has been on top of his game is his appearance as the No. 1 player in the majors.The Masters was the eighth time he went into a major at No. 1 in the world. Only three other players have done that more since the world ranking began in 1986 — Dustin Johnson with 15, Greg Norman with 24 and Tiger Woods with 55.Winning at No. 1 doesn’t happen all that often. Both times Scheffler won the Masters he was No. 1 in the world. No one else in the non-Woods division has done that. Ian Woosnam (1991), Fred Couples (1992) and Johnson (2020) won the Masters at No. 1, while Rory McIlroy won the PGA Championship (2014) as the top-ranked player.Woods won 11 of his 15 majors at No. 1 in the world.Adam Schenk will go through the rest of the year knowing he’s headed back to the Masters because he tied for 12th in his debut. He still can’t imagine how it unfolded for him.“I thought if we birdied one of the last two holes, we’d have a good chance,” he said.He settled for two pars, signed for a 73 and was tied for 13th.“I knew there were a couple of people on the course that could help me,” Schenk said. “It really weird rooting against people. I don’t like doing that. And it was Cam Davis, the nicest guy out here.”Davis needed 35 feet for birdie, just off the back of the green, when his putt had too much pace, too much break and kept rolling left of the pin until it was off the green. He chipped up to 3 feet and missed the putt, making double bogey.That moved Schenk up to a tie for 12th. He was thrilled Davis made par on No. 18 to also finish in a tie for 12th. All in all, a great debut.“If he had made birdie on the last hole, it would have been motivation for me to finish top 50 in the world, make the Tour Championship, whatever,” Schenk said about the paths back. “Just knowing how badly I want to get back there. To know I’m there is nice.”As for the rest of the week, he has no idea how much money he spent in the pro shop.“I can tell you my wife spent more than me,” Schenk said. “The more I went in the pro shop, I kept buying.”The PGA Tour University ranking already has produced Ludvig Aberg, an exceptional talent who within a year of leaving Texas Tech won on the European tour, the PGA Tour, played in the Ryder Cup and was runner-up at the Masters.As much as Scottie Scheffler is dominating golf, Aberg already is seen as one of his biggest threats.Next in line is Gordon Sargent of Vanderbilt. But some patience is required.Sargent already is eligible for a PGA Tour card through the accelerated ranking set aside for underclassmen. But he’s going to stay for his senior year, deferring his card until 2025.That got a nod of approval from Aberg.“He’s a tremendous golf player,” Aberg said. “I think he’s got some good people around him making good decisions. For me in my case, I think a fourth year at Tech really helped me. It helped me keep developing, keep getting better and keep maturing as a player and as a person.“It is a little bit different playing tour golf than it is in college, but I’m sure he’ll be ready whenever his time comes.”Tiger Woods finally has a roster for his TGL team called, “Jupiter Links, which draws in players living in Scottsdale, Arizona (Max Homa), Dallas (Tom Kim) and Aiken, South Carolina (Kevin Kisner).Woods is part owner of Jupiter Links and a co-founder of TMRW Sports, the entertainment outfit behind the technology league that will be played in an arena in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, starting Jan. 7.“I have already shared my excitement and optimism for TGL as a league and product,” Woods said. “Now that we have finalized our roster with a team of world-class golfers, I am even more confident that this group will proudly represent the Jupiter area and connect with our fans for years to come.”The International team for the Presidents Cup is building some familiarity in the back room. It’s the same leadership as 2022, except for Ernie Els stepping in for K.J. Choi.International captain Mike Weir said his four assistants would be Els, Trevor Immelman, Camilo Villegas and Geoff Ogilvy. Two years ago at Quail Hollow, Immelman was the captain and had Weir, Villegas, Ogilvy and Choi as assistants.Els was the 2019 captain and gave the International team a real identity with its shield on the logo.

Fred Goodall,"TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Experience tells the Tampa Bay Lightning it’s time to go to work — not panic.The New York Islanders are also down 2-0 after playing well at times and losing their first two games of the NHL playoffs on the road.Both teams understand it’ll take a lot more than a return to home ice Thursday night — the Lightning versus Florida, and the Islanders hosting Carolina —to alter the course of those first-round matchups.New York blew a three-goal lead in its Game 2 loss to the Hurricanes. Tampa Bay dropped a pair of one-goal games to the Panthers to fall behind 2-0 in a series for the first time since losing Games 1 and 2 of the 2020 Eastern Conference on the road to the New York Rangers.A late empty-net goal wound up being the difference in Game 1. Carter Verhaeghe’s overtime winner decided Game 2.“They’re really exciting. You’re on the edge of your seat. There are big saves at both ends of the ice, But in the end, they made the last play. And they’ve done it both nights,” Lightning coach Jon Cooper said.“And we can’t hang our hat on: ’Wow, we were close.’ That’s what teams that are playing golf right now are saying,” Cooper added. “If we don’t want to be that, we have to be the team that makes the extra play.”The core of Tampa Bay’s star-studded roster features a slew of holdovers from the teams that won back-to-back Stanley Cup titles in 2020 and 2021.Two years ago, the Lightning dropped the first two games of the East final before rallying over the Rangers to reach a third consecutive Stanley Cup Final.“Obviously it’s a big hole, but we have done it before,” Lightning captain Steven Stamkos said.Cooper stressed there’s only one way to do it. One game at a time.“We’re not going to win two games (Thursday night). We’ve just got to win one,” Cooper said. “There’s a big difference of down 0-3 and 2-1,” Cooper added. “It’s our job to make sure it’s 2-1.”PANTHERS at LIGHTNING, Panthers lead 2-0, 7 p.m. ET (TBS)The Panthers have their first problem of these playoffs.Sam Bennett, who was fifth on the team in scoring during the regular season and had a goal and an assist before getting hurt in Game 2 of the Panthers’ series with the Tampa Bay Lightning, is out for at least a week with an upper-body injury.The good news, Panthers coach Paul Maurice said without revealing specifics, is the injury wasn’t as bad as the team first feared. Bennett left the ice after getting struck by a shot from Florida teammate Brandon Montour in the second period of what became a 3-2 OT win that gave the defending Eastern Conference champions a 2-0 series lead.Bennett was not traveling with the team to Tampa on Wednesday. He’ll be evaluated again next week.“You want to stay healthy. Every team’s trying to,” Maurice said. “But every team is going to have players come out of the lineup.”Bennett immediately dropped his stick, appeared to be holding his wrist and skated toward the Panthers’ bench after getting hit with the puck. Once at the bench, he only paused for a second or two before heading down the tunnel toward the Florida locker room for evaluation. He missed 13 games for Florida this season, including 12 of the team’s first 13 contests.HURRICANES at ISLANDERS, Hurricanes lead 2-0, 7:30 p.m. ET (ESPN2)The Islanders will make a switch in net for Game 3, turning to Ilya Sorokin after Semyon Varlamov took the first two losses. Varlamov allowed six goals while facing 63 shots through the two games in Raleigh, with coach Patrick Roy saying it would be good to have a “fresh” goaltender in Sorokin (25-19-0, 3.01 goals-against average, .909 save percentage).“I just feel that he’s coming in the perfect scenario,” Roy said Wednesday. “We’re down 2-0 in this series, now he’s going in. All he can do is go in and enjoy the ride.”The Islanders had chances to win both of the road games to start this series, notably by blowing a 3-0 lead in Monday’s 5-3 loss in Game 2. Carolina scored the tying and winning goals nine seconds apart late in the third period, though Roy was more disappointed by the first loss that saw New York play closer to its preferred game.To his point, the Hurricanes dominated Game 2 after falling into their big hole with long and often withering shifts in the offensive zone. By the end, Carolina had taken a 39-12 shot advantage – including 17-1 in the third period – while finishing with a 110-28 edge in shots attempted.Islanders center Bo Horvat said they must do a better job of managing the puck and breaking out cleaner for transition chances after getting hemmed in for long stretches by the Hurricanes’ aggressive forecheck.“We’re in good spirits here regardless of the score,” center Mathew Barzal said. “We’re taking this day by day and we’re enjoying the moment. We’ve got a chance now at an epic comeback.”On the other side, Carolina won’t have veteran defenseman Brett Pesce, who left in the second period of Game 2 with a non-contact lower-body injury. Coach Rod Brind’Amour said Pesce is “more than likely” out for the series. That likely will move offensive-minded blue-liner Tony DeAngelo into the Carolina lineup, with him working in a pairing with Brady Skjei at Wednesday’s practice.AP Sports Writers Tim Reynolds in Miami and Aaron Beard in Raleigh, N.C., contributed to this report.AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL",2024-04-25 01:03:17 AM EEST,NPR,Lightning and Islanders searching for answers to rebound from 2-0 deficits in NHL playoffs,https://apnews.com/article/nhl-playoffs-lightning-panthers-hurricanes-islanders-94f70c68a1eb69f3df15b16739c3354b
Jay Cohen,"CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago Cubs reliever Luke Little said he had to change his glove before he entered Wednesday night’s 4-3 victory over the Houston Astros because of an American flag patch.Manager Craig Counsell went to insert Little with one out in the seventh inning. But as the 6-foot-8 left-hander went through the usual check by umpires for pitchers coming into the game, he was told he had to swap out his glove.“The issue was the American flag was on his glove,” Counsell said. “Pitchers’ gloves, they’re pretty strict about not having white on the pitchers’ gloves. Apparently the flag had what could be a distraction to the hitter.”As Little went to the mound to warm up for his ninth appearance of the season and No. 16 for his career, a clubhouse attendant went to his locker to find a replacement. The first glove he brought to Little also had an American flag patch, so he went back to get another one — which hadn’t been broken in.“I had to beat it a little bit, try and get it flexed out,” Little said. “Of all the things to do is breaking in a glove during a game.”The 23-year-old Little, a North Carolina native, said he has been using the same glove since Class A ball. After the issue was resolved, he retired each of the two batters he faced.Following the victory, Little posted “ Proud to be an American ... Go Cubs Go ” on X, formerly known as Twitter, along with a flag emoji and a GIF of wrestler Hulk Hogan playing a guitar in front of an American flag.“The clubbies told me that they had got an email from MLB that I’m not allowed to wear it,” he told the AP. “But I just didn’t assume that they were just going to just cut me. It’s not like it has an advantage in the game. It’s not like it blinds the hitters. Just representing my country.“Just a whole debacle. Got to get ready without it and throw through it.”A message was left late Wednesday night seeking comment from MLB.AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",2024-04-25 07:45:14 AM EEST,NPR,Cubs reliever Luke Little forced to change his glove because of white in American flag patch,https://apnews.com/article/cubs-luke-little-glove-668d5a2f2bfdfd61c5879e2e311c5b20
None,"ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Adolis García and Evan Carter hit Texas’ first back-to-back home runs this season and the Rangers beat the Seattle Mariners 5-1 on Wednesday night.García’s team-high seventh homer in the fourth inning barely cleared the wall in straight-away center field and tipped off the glove of Julio Rodríguez. García stood near first base apparently thinking Rodríguez made the catch until he saw the center fielder walk toward the infield, turn and look over the fence.“I’ve seen Julio do that deke before where he acts like he didn’t catch it, so I didn’t know what was going on,” said Carter, who watched from the on-deck circle.Mariners manager Scott Servais said he thought Rodríguez made the catch.“It’s right at him, right over his head,” Servais said. “Tough to get back to the fence and make a jump. You’re kind of off balance when you get there. Heck of an effort.”The homer snapped Texas’ 25-innings home scoreless streak. The Rangers were shut out by the Mariners on three hits on Tuesday.“You’re looking for a shot in the arm,” Rangers manager Bruce Bochy said. “Man, those are two big hits.”Carter, who was dropped from third to fifth in the batting order, hit a triple to drive home García in the seventh in an inning kept alive on an obstruction call at first base against Mariners reliever Austin Voth when Nathaniel Lowe appeared to hit into a 3-6-3 double play.Texas scored twice in the sixth when Jonah Heim singled into the right field corner and Mitch Haniger committed a two-base error.Jonathan Hernández (1-0), making his first appearance of the season, retired four of the five batters he faced. Hernández was sidelined with a lat strain until being activated from the 15-day injured list on Tuesday.The Mariners left nine runners on base and were 1 for 11 with runners in scoring position.Josh Rojas scored Seattle’s run in the first inning on a fielder’s choice grounder by Haniger after opening the game with a triple. Rojas led off for the first time this season after J.P. Crawford was a late scratch because of right oblique soreness.Rangers starter Jon Gray allowed one run on seven hits in 4 2/3 innings. Gray, who returned to the rotation after pitching 1 2/3 relief innings last Saturday at Atlanta, struck out seven and walked one.The Mariners’ Bryce Miller (3-2) gave up the two homers and four hits plus four walks in four-plus innings.Texas’ Corey Seager left the game following the seventh inning with a left shin contusion after being hit by a pitch. Bochy said he didn’t know if Seager would be available Thursday.Rangers rookie Wyatt Langford, 1 for 12 before Wednesday, had his first three-hit game.Mariners: Servais said he didn’t know if either Crawford or C Cal Raleigh, who sat out following a tooth extraction, will be available Thursday.Rangers: RHP Max Scherzer (back surgery) pitched 2 1/3 innings for Triple-A Round Rock in his first rehab outing this year. He allowed three runs on five hits, two of them home runs, struck out four and threw 52 pitches. … RHP Austin Pruitt (right knee medial meniscus injury) was placed on the 15-day injured list retroactive to Sunday.Mariners RHP Luis Castillo (1-4, 4.40 ERA), who has allowed 18 hits but fanned 19 in 14 2/3 career innings vs. Texas, will start the series finale on Thursday.

Janie Mccauley,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Whether at home or on the road, Art Schallock would begin each day by taking the elevator down to the lobby and collecting the latest comic books for roommate Yogi Berra.“Every morning,” Schallock recalled, chuckling at the thought decades later.Schallock never minded. It was all worth it.Just part of being the new guy back in the day, a rite of passage for the latest big leaguer getting promoted. Schallock got the call in 1951, replacing future Hall of Famer Mickey Mantle when the New York Yankees optioned the then-19-year-old to Triple-A. Schallock, then 27, roomed with Berra and was tasked with picking up Berra’s daily delivery of “funnies” as they called them.The oldest living former major leaguer, Schallock turns 100 on Thursday and is being celebrated in the Bay Area and beyond as the milestone approaches.The baseball memories are still plenty fresh.“That was quite a thrill, quite a thrill playing with those guys,” Schallock shared in a video call. “I roomed with Yogi Berra when I got up there and he knew all the hitters. We went over all the hitters on each team. Besides that, I had to run down to the lobby and get his funny books. Every morning. Yogi knew all the hitters, how to pitch to them, whether it’s low, high or whatever, he knew how to pitch to them. And I had to learn from him.”The Bay Area native went to Tamalpais High in Mill Valley then College of Marin before becoming the 10,823rd major league player when he debuted on July 16, 1951. He pitched 2 2/3 innings for the Yankees that day at Detroit, then earned his first career win exactly one month later at Washington.The left-hander won three World Series rings from 1951-53, although he only pitched in the ‘53 Series, retiring Brooklyn’s Jackie Robinson during a two-inning outing in Game 4. He went 6-7 with a 4.02 ERA over five seasons in 58 games and 14 starts with the Yankees and Orioles.He still wears one of those World Series rings regularly on his pitching hand.“Here’s a game that I loved, I really enjoyed it and loved the game of baseball and they pay you for it. What more can you ask for?” Schallock said. “I wish I was playing today and getting the salaries that they get, but that’s the way it goes.”Schallock shakes his head and smiles about the money. He signed with the Dodgers for $5,000, and if he lasted past June 1 he received another $5,000 payment.“When I got out of the service, I went to junior college for a couple of years and pitched baseball there and then I pitched semi-pro in San Francisco and made a name for myself and Brooklyn signed me,” he shared.Schallock still has some years to go to set any kind of age records. Negro Leagues pitcher Si Simmons of the 1926 New York Lincoln Giants lived to 111, while another ex-Yankees pitcher, Red Hoff, reached 107.Though Schallock has a hard time hearing these days, he relishes every chance to chat about baseball. And he offers no real secrets to his longevity — no strict exercise regimen or special diet.“Stop having a drink, have two,” he said, laughing. “That’s all I was allowed to drink before dinner, that was it, my wife cut me off. Vodka over the rocks with a little splash of water, vodka and water and a little ice. Only two. I also had a few beers.""(Yankees manager) Casey Stengel always had beer in the clubhouse after the game. He’d rather see you drink in the clubhouse rather than some bar. ‘Cuz two or three of you go in the bar and sit down, the fans think you’re a drunk because you’re sitting in a bar, so you drink in the ballpark.”Of course, there’s been some good fortune along the way to make it to 100.Serving for the U.S. Navy in the Pacific Ocean during World War II after enlisting in 1942, Schallock narrowly escaped harm when the neighboring aircraft carrier USS Liscome Bay was sunk by a Japanese torpedo in November 1943 and 644 were killed — accounting for the majority of the casualties in the Battle of Makin.“I never thought I would get back to the highest level. I wanted to play baseball, yes,” he said. “I did it in junior college. In those years, the Bay Area was full of baseball. When I say full of baseball, semi-pros. Every town had a team.”Schallock has been signing his share of baseballs leading up to joining the rare centenarian club. They will throw him a party at his assisted living facility, Cogir On Napa Road Assisted Living and Memory Care.Perhaps find him an agent now given all the fanfare?“It’s too late,” Schallock said, laughing, “it’s too late.”AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB",2024-04-25 13:00:07 PM EEST,NPR,"He replaced Mickey Mantle.

Craig Meyer,"DENVER (AP) — Xander Bogaerts had a season-high three hits, Matt Waldron gave up one run in six innings and the San Diego Padres beat the Colorado Rockies 5-2 on Wednesday night.“Getting ahead was the name of my game today,” Waldron said. “(Catcher Kyle Higashioka) and I executed well and the offense did what they do. It’s awesome. It was a fun win. Hopefully, we can keep it rolling.”Ha-Seong Kim and Jackson Merrill had two RBIs to help the Padres beat the Rockies for the 11th time in their past 14 meetings. Kim had two hits, including a bloop double to right field that drove in the game’s first two runs and spurred a four-run first inning.“When (Colorado starter) Ty (Blach) is on, he’s hitting his spots,” Rockies manager Bud Black said. “The first inning, he didn’t. Then the baseball got him with the blooper. Really good pitch to Kim and then it’s just the little dorker right down the right field line. That’s baseball.”Waldron (1-2) rebounded from his worst outing of the season, a loss against Toronto in which he allowed five runs and seven hits in 4 2/3 innings. With four runs on the board before he took the mound for the first time, Waldron got some much-needed run support after San Diego scored just seven runs in his previous four starts.“Credit goes to Waldron,” Padres manager Mike Shildt said. “He was very, very good. All pitches working. He mixed it in masterfully and had command of it. It was really filthy.”Robert Suarez picked up his ninth save of the season, retiring the Rockies in order on seven pitches.The multi-hit outing was the second in the past four games for Bogaerts, who entered Wednesday night batting just .198.The game was the 25th consecutive to start this season in which the Rockies have trailed at some point. They’re only the second team to reach that mark since 1900, joining the 1910 St. Louis Browns.In his first start of the season, Blach (3-4) took the loss for the Rockies, giving up four runs and five hits in five innings.“I think I had a pretty good feel in the first inning,” Blach said. “I made a lot of really good pitches with two strikes. They battled and fouled them off. It’s just kind of one of those things where I wouldn’t really change anything.”Ryan McMahon and Elias Díaz each hit solo home runs to center field for Colorado, which left six runners on base, including three in the fourth inning when it had the bases loaded with just one out before a pop-up and groundout ended the threat.The Rockies have been outscored 35-7 in the first inning this season, the most runs allowed by any team in the first inning. It finished with two runs or fewer for the eighth time in the past 10 games, despite five of those contests taking place at hitter-friendly Coors Field.Colorado RHP Dakota Hudson (0-4, 5.06 ERA) was set to face RHP Randy Vásquez (0-1, 1.80) in the fourth and final game of the series.AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",2024-04-25 07:15:27 AM EEST,NPR,"Xander Bogaerts has season-high 3 hits, Padres beat Rockies 5-2",https://apnews.com/article/padres-rockies-score-e66f58b203b300fcb54911d4c714be28

He took a pass from Danton Heinen and ripped a shot past goalie Ilya Samsonov’s ear. Marchand capped the scoring with an empty-netter and also had an assist.“We stuck with it all game,” Marchand said. “We elevated to another level.”The Maple Leafs were livid at Marchand’s agitating antics.“The gamesmanship and everything, it’s world class,” Toronto coach Sheldon Keefe said about Marchand. “He’s been in the league long enough … he gets calls. It’s unbelievable, actually, how it goes. We’ve got to play through that.”Marchand got tangled up with Bertuzzi in the second period with Toronto up 1-0. A frothing Scotiabank Arena crowd clamoring for a penalty, the referees took no issues before Trent Frederic scored the tying goal seconds later.“I don’t think there’s another player in this series that gets away with taking out Bertuzzi’s legs the way that he does,” Keefe said. “It’s an art and he’s elite at it. We have to manage our way through that.”Jake DeBrusk also scored for Boston, and Jeremy Swayman made 28 saves. Swayman made 35 saves in Boston’s 5-1 victory in Game 1, then gave way to Linus Ullmark in Toronto’s 3-2 victory in Game 2.Matthew Knies also scored for Toronto, and Samsonov made 30 saves. Toronto was 0 for 5 on the power play, leaving it 1 for 11 in the series.“At times we played well,” Keefe said. “Not well enough to get the win.”Game 4 of the best-of-seven series is Saturday night at Scotiabank Arena.Toronto pulled Samsonov for the extra attacker with just over two minutes to go, but Maple Leafs captain John Tavares took a holding penalty with 1:04 left and Marchand sealed it with the empty-net goal.The Maple Leafs opened the scoring with 6:50 left in the second. Mitch Marner deftly moved past a defender and slid a pass for Knies to redirect upstairs on Swayman.Boston tied it with 2:23 left in the period when Frederic’s shot went off the lost and in.

Cliff Brunt,"OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Thunder rookie Chet Holmgren won his center matchup with Jonas Valanciunas and helped Oklahoma City beat the New Orleans Pelicans 124-92 in Game 2 of their first-round playoff series Wednesday night.Holmgren had 26 points and seven rebounds as the Thunder took a 2-0 lead. He made 9 of 13 field goals to support Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s 33-point effort.“He was really good,” Gilgeous-Alexander said. “He was in the actions, got out of them and then put their defense in a bind almost all of the night. And he was making shots, putting it down. He was A-plus tonight, for sure.”Valanciunas scored 11 points in the first three minutes but did little damage after that. He finished with 19 points and seven rebounds.The two offer contrasting styles.Holmgren, listed as 7-foot-1 and a slender 208 pounds, is the new-age center who shoots 3-pointers and can defend any position. He’s a finalist for Rookie of the Year and one of the league’s best shot blockers.Valanciunas is a 7-foot, 270-pound traditional big man. He’s a hulking presence who is at his best punishing opponents near the hoop.Valanciunas made 5 of 7 field goals in the first quarter, but 3 of 7 the rest of the game.“Obviously, he’s a good player and he’s confident in his ability,” Holmgren said. “They’re going to him in the post, trying to have him make some plays down there, and it’s my job to make those plays as tough as possible. He’s a good player. I’m not going to shut him out on a decent amount of touches. So I’ve just got to make those as hard as possible and it’ll work out in our favor if I do my job.”Holmgren struggled at times with the matchup in Game 1, a 94-92 win for Oklahoma City. Though he had 15 points, 11 rebounds and five blocks that night, Valanciunas had 13 points and 20 rebounds, including nine offensive boards.Early in Game 2, while Valanciunas was doing damage in the paint, Holmgren was stretching the defense. He scored 13 points in the first seven minutes, including three 3-pointers. His 15 points in the first quarter were the most any Thunder rookie has scored in any quarter of a playoff game.In Game 1, Holmgren opened the scoring with a 3-pointer, then missed his next six shots. In Game 2, he went 5-for-5 from the field in the opening quarter.“In the first game, I hit my first one and then threw up like four bricks after that,” he said. “So I just wanted to come out ready tonight to make my shots and capitalize on the advantages that we have out there.”Holmgren helped set the tone with his willingness to mix it up with Valanciunas. When he wasn’t making 3-pointers, he was standing up to his much stronger opponent in the paint and using his long arms to help limit Valanciunas to two offensive rebounds.“They came out physical,” Valanciunas said. “They were aggressors. So we kind of — I don’t know what to say. Like, we didn’t expect them to play that way, and that’s on us. It’s not acceptable. It was a shame today.”AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",2024-04-25 09:37:17 AM EEST,NPR,Thunder’s Holmgren bests Pelicans’ Valanciunas in center matchup to help OKC take 2-0 lead,https://apnews.com/article/holmgren-valanciunas-89b1b85c1ad27a96731fe9784ea60f42
Stephen Hawkins,"DALLAS (AP) — Jack Eichel and defending Stanley Cup champion Vegas got exactly what they anticipated, and withstood that early hard push in Game 2 by the desperate Dallas Stars.The Golden Knights didn’t settle for a split while starting the first-round series on the road.“We expected them to come out and push hard that first five, 10 minutes and they did,” Eichel said. “We responded. We were able to come in here after the first period and it’s all tied. ... They gave us all we could handle.”Eichel assisted on the tying goal by Jonathan Marchessault late in the first period before adding an empty-netter late, Noah Hanifin scored the tiebreaker with unassisted goal late in the second period and the Knights won 3-1 on Wednesday night for a 2-0 series lead.Game 3 is Saturday night in Las Vegas.“We’re in a good spot, but there’s still a lot of hockey left to be played,” Hanifin said. “We’re happy to get back into our building and have that momentum on our side. ... Just got to keep doing what we’re doing, chipping away at it and play our game.”Hanifin was one of the three trade-deadline acquisitions for the Knights, the No. 8 seed in the Western Conference.Marchessault’s second goal of the series was his franchise-record 36th in the postseason while appearing in all 90 of Vegas’ playoff games. Logan Thompson had 20 saves in his second career playoff start, though Dallas didn’t get a shot to him in the final 5:37 of the game.In the Western Conference Final last May, the Knights were the top seed when winning the first three games against Dallas and eventually taking the series in six games.After falling 4-3 in the opener of this first-round series, the Stars came out intent on setting a hard-hitting tone before the series shifted West.Mason Marchment took defenseman Zach Whitecloud off his skates with a jarring hit behind the Vegas net only 2 1/2 minutes into the game. Knights captain Mark Stone ended up on the ice midway through the first period when it appeared that he was going to take a shot at Jason Robertson, who instead bowed up and delivered a body blow instead.In the end, Dallas still couldn’t take down the Knights.“Loved our first period. We make one mistake at the end of the first, probably deserved to be up. That was probably a critical point in the game,” Stars coach Pete DeBoer said. “Eichel, the wrong guy gets behind us at the wrong time. And that’s what they do, they make you pay. So you come out of the first after playing a great period and you have nothing to show for it.”Hanifin’s go-ahead goal with 1:07 left in the second period came after defenseman Esa Lindell blocked two shots in a row.Robertson put Dallas up 1-0 with his second goal of the series, on a power play with 3:13 left in the first period. His 10th career playoff goal was his eighth against Vegas.After Eichel’s shot went in the empty net late, Robertson broke his stick when he slammed it against the post.The goal by Robertson came soon after Marchment whiffed at a loose puck that had popped off Thompson’s glove, and another scramble in front of the goalie when Roope Hintz was denied twice.The Knights got even with 1:51 left in the first period on a charge when Eichel made a move that Jake Oettinger bit on. The goalie slipped down and Marchessault had an open side of the net after getting a nifty pass.“We settled in eventually. You don’t want want 1-0 to turn into 2-0, so we did a good job with that,” Vegas coach Bruce Cassidy said. “Go into the intermission 1-1, we haven’t been our best, but we got through it.”Oettinger had 23 saves, including a sequence in the second period when he knocked away three successive shots by Shea Theodore.After his first shot was blocked, Theodore gathered the loose puck and tried a backhander on which Oettinger made a sprawling save, lunging to knock away the puck with his extended glove. The Knights defenseman got the puck again, skated around a couple of Stars and his third shot went off the goalie who was still laying on the ice at the edge of the crease.That was during a 4-on-4 period after a scuffle in front of Oettinger when his teammate Ryan Suter threw Anthony Mantha down and both got roughing penalties.Thomas had a couple of close-range saves right after that.AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",2024-04-25 08:43:14 AM EEST,NPR,Defending champion Golden Knights beat Stars 3-1 to take 2-0 series lead home to Vegas,https://apnews.com/article/golden-knights-stars-score-nhl-playoffs-2693e54a995f5c92878f0855d82164ed
Brett Martel,"AVONDALE, La. (AP) — For this week, at least, Rory McIlroy is focused on “fun” during his first visit to New Orleans for the PGA Tour’s lone team event.McIlroy and teammate Shane Lowry have their restaurant reservations booked in this city renowned for its dining scene. A stroll down Bourbon Street also is on McIlroy’s agenda, so he can “say I’ve been there and I’ve got the T-shirt and then move on. I don’t think I want to spend too much time down there.”Soon, however, the No. 2-ranked golfer in the world will be ready to resume exerting his considerable influence over serious matters surrounding the fractured state of men’s professional golf.McIlroy said Wednesday that he is interested in returning to the PGA Tour’s policy board, from which he resigned abruptly last November.“I don’t think there’s been much progress made in the last eight months, and I was hopeful that there would be,” McIlroy said, alluding his goal of seeing a formalized unification of the PGA Tour and upstart, Saudi Arabia-funded LIV Golf.“I think I could be helpful to the process,” McIlroy said. “But only if people want me involved.”The PGA Tour and LIV are in merger talks, but they have been protracted, with no clear end in sight. Both tours have continued to operate independently, keeping many of the top names in golf from competing against one another for most of the golf calendar — major tournaments (Masters, US Open, British Open and PGA Championship) excepted.Meanwhile, the PGA Tour has taken on Strategic Sports Group as a minority investor in a deal that could be worth as much as $3 billion.Webb Simpson, one of the six player directors on the PGA Tour board and PGA Tour Enterprises board, has submitted a letter saying that he wants to resign as a player director, but only if McIlroy replaces him, according to a person who has seen the letter.The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Tuesday because the letter was not made public.After his pro-am round at the Zurich Classic on Wednesday, McIlroy said he started thinking about returning to the board when Simpson approached him about it.“I said, ‘Look, if it was something that other people wanted, I would gladly take that seat,’ and that was the conversation that we had,” McIlroy said. “I feel like I care a lot, and I have some pretty good experience and good connections within the game and sort of around the wider sort of ecosystem and everything that’s going on.“But at the end of the day, it’s not quite up to me to just come back on the board,” he added. “There’s a process that has to be followed.”The other board members are Patrick Cantlay, Peter Malnati, Adam Scott, Jordan Spieth and Tiger Woods.McIlroy said he sees a completed merger of the PGA and LIV tours as “the only way forward for the game of golf.”He said he aims to promote compromise while also trying “to help people see the benefits of what unification could do for the game and what it could do for this tour in particular.”“We obviously realize the game is not unified right now for a reason, and there’s still some hard feelings and things that need to be addressed,” McIlroy said. “But I think at this point, for the good of the game, we all need to put those feelings aside and all move forward together.”In the meantime, the 34-year-old McIlroy, of Northern Ireland, sounds eager to participate in what, for him, is a new event while taking in one of American’s more culturally distinctive cities.“This is my 17th year as a professional golfer, and to be able to still do things for the first time like play in this event and experience something like this is pretty cool,” McIlroy said.McIlroy and Shane Lowry, a 37-yearold Irishman, have been teammates before in the Ryder Cup. So, their partnership at the Zurich Classic is not entirely unfamiliar to them.“We thought it would be fun to team up together again in something like this,” McIlroy said. “Just really excited to spend the week with Shane.“To sort of relax and play under maybe not the amount of pressure or the stress that we’ve both been under the last couple of weeks I think is a nice thing,” McIlroy said. “It’s nice to be able to rely on a teammate every now and again and bail you out of trouble or know that you don’t have to play perfect golf because you’ve got someone right there beside you.”Lowry, meanwhile, sounded no less excited to be able to lean on McIlroy’s game at the Pete Dye-designed TPC Louisiana, where the winning team will earn $2.57 million (about $1.29 million each).“Rory is probably like No. 1 on people’s lists to come play here with,” Lowry said. “We’ll be good for each other on the course. We’ll enjoy doing it, which is a big part of it as well.”McIlroy and Lowry are one of several high-profile pairs among the 80 teams at the Zurich.Others include: 2022 champions Xander Schauffele and Patrick Cantlay; Matt Fitzpatrick and younger brother Alex; Collin Morikawa and Kurt Kitayama; Billy Horschel and Tyson Alexander; Sahith Theegala and Will Zalatoris; Fancesco Molinari and Luke Donald; and defending champions Nick Hardy and Davis Riley.AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",2024-04-25 02:17:55 AM EEST,NPR,"McIlroy ready to return to PGA Tour policy board, and eager to enjoy his first trip to New Orleans",https://apnews.com/article/pga-zurich-classic-rory-mcilroy-84d3252189a1bbe8353b5f17a2038a9d
Brian Mahoney,"NEW YORK (AP) — The New York Knicks know when it’s coming.When they throw a careless pass that leads to a turnover, or hoist a bad shot that ruins a possession, their coach is likely standing on the sideline with arms in the air, furious he’s just witnessed such careless miscues.Like any coach, Tom Thibodeau doesn’t like mistakes but unlike others in the NBA coaching ranks, he doesn’t bother hiding it from the nearly 20,000 people in the arena watching.“I mean, I’ve played for a lot of animated coaches in my life,” New York guard Deuce McBride said. “He might take the cake.”The Knicks players say they don’t mind. They know that along with an occasional Thibodeau tantrum, there’s also the enormous planning and preparation he provides that has helped them take a 2-0 lead over the Philadelphia 76ers heading into Game 3 on Thursday night.Some NBA coaches spend much of a game yelling, but most times it’s at the referees. Rare is the coach who so demonstratively shows when he’s mad at his own players.Many may chastise players during timeouts, or wait until they’re back in the privacy of the locker room at halftime. But Thibodeau reacts immediately when he’s seen something he can’t stomach.Thibodeau isn’t sure why it’s a topic of discussion and is incredulous when asked about his unusual sideline manner.“What are you expecting, a celebration?” he says.His players expect the unexpected from Thibodeau — even if they don’t always see it.“Sometimes you don’t even notice it, because no matter what’s going on over there, he’s going to say something,” All-Star point guard Jalen Brunson said.Josh Hart doesn’t bother glancing toward the bench when he knows Thibodeau will be glaring back at him.“Nah, I don’t really look at him too much. I hear him. Damn sure hear him,” Hart said.“Sometimes you can’t help but hear him. But I let Thibs be Thibs,” Hart continued. “He’s going to yell no matter what, so I’m the kind of guy it doesn’t really affect me if he yells, because I’m going to play my game how I play my game no matter what. So I don’t look at him.”Brunson chuckles as he reflects about it, as does McBride. They are Thibodeau’s type of players, second-round picks who embrace tough coaching — or anything else that leads to team success.The Knicks have had more of it under Thibodeau than anyone else in a quarter of a century. They won a playoff series last year for the first time in a decade. They are halfway to doing it again, winning 50 games and earning the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference despite playing without their entire starting frontcourt of All-Star Julius Randle, OG Anunoby and Mitchell Robinson for a large part of the season.Brunson’s arrival in the summer of 2022 has led to much of that success, but he’s not spared Thibodeau’s wrath. Nor is he bothered by it. His father, Rick, played for the Knicks when Thibodeau was an assistant and was his assistant in Chicago and now in New York, so Brunson has known the coach since he was young.“I think yes, he’s passionate, but the one thing we all understand is that he’s prepared,” Brunson said. “So he’s not really yelling at you for some BS or something that probably didn’t happen or whatever. He’s more proactive versus reactive, so it’s never really something that as a player we can be like, ‘I didn’t do that, or this hasn’t happened yet.’ Like, he’s preparing us.”Yes, but NBA players often expect to see no reaction at all. They know they messed up and don’t need the coach to call attention to it.Monty Williams, whose Detroit Pistons were a turnover-prone team that had the NBA’s worst record at 14-68, recalls his grandmother once telling him he needed to tone down his reactions during a game and remembers that when he wants to flip out.“Sometimes I’m ashamed at some of the things I may be thinking,” he said. “I try, because at the end of the day as a believer in Christ I want to treat everybody with a great level of respect and dignity no matter what they do on the court. So that’s my motivation as to why I do it.”The Knicks don’t expect Thibodeau to tone it down. McBride, who endured Hall of Fame coach Bob Huggins’ tirades at West Virginia, assumes that’s what the players have signed up for.“We’re all grown,” he said. “If there was something we didn’t like we would have approached him, but I mean, it’s no harm, no foul.”The Knicks have reached the playoffs three times in four seasons under Thibodeau after getting there only three times in the previous 16 years. The two-time Coach of the Year is still seeking his first title and has to prove his demanding style works in the playoffs.But so far, there’s no reason for Thibodeau or his players to question it.“Often times, it’s one play that’s the difference between winning and losing, and mental mistakes right now could be the difference between moving on and going home,” Thibodeau said. “So your concentration level is so important. Using good judgment is so important.”AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",2024-04-25 13:00:06 PM EEST,NPR,"Thibodeau shows when he’s mad at his Knicks.

Jimmy Golen,"BOSTON (AP) — The Miami Heat beat Boston with an unprecedented barrage of 3-pointers on Wednesday night to erase the home-court advantage the Celtics worked all season to establish.Tyler Herro had 24 points and 14 assists, hitting six of Miami’s 23 3-pointers — the most in a playoff game in franchise history — to lead the Heat to a 111-101 victory over top-seeded Boston and tie the first-round playoff series at one game apiece.“It was a very good response,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “And then we also made some shots. It always looks better when you make shots.”Bam Adebayo had 21 points and 10 rebounds, and new Celtics nemesis Caleb Martin also had 21 points for the Heat, who shot 53.5% (23 of 43) from beyond the arc to bounce back after a Game 1 blowout. That broke Miami’s playoff record of 20 3-pointers, set against the Bucks in the 2021 first round.“They obviously made a conscious effort to have free reign to shoot more,” Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said.And shoot and shoot and shoot.Playing their third straight game without playoff stalwart Jimmy Butler, who was injured in the opening play-in game, Miami shot better than 50% from 3-point range in each of the first three quarters (and a still productive 4 of 10 in the fourth).After Boston cut an 11-point lead to six, 102-96, with 3:16 to play, Martin hit a 3 and Boston never got as close as two possessions again.“You have to take ‘em, based on how they were playing us the first two games,” said Spoelstra, who saw Boston hit 22 3-pointers to Miami’s 12 in the opener. “I did not want to get annihilated in that department like we did the game before.”Jaylen Brown scored 33 points for Boston. Jayson Tatum scored 28, showing no ill-effects of Martin’s hard foul that sent him crashing to the floor with under a minute to play in Boston’s 114-94 victory on Sunday.Tatum got up off the parquet floor.But so did Miami.“It seemed we couldn’t get them to miss,” Brown said. “They had a record-breaking night. ... They made a lot of shots that usually we’re comfortable with.”The series moves to Miami for Games 3 and 4 on Saturday and Monday.“It’s always a good thing if you can get one on the road,” Martin said. “You always look to try to steal one. We were able to do that.”The Celtics won 64 games in the regular season to claim home-court advantage through the NBA Finals, but they didn’t make very good use of it on Wednesday despite a crowd that was still fired up over seeing their star land hard in the series opener.Tatum had his first career playoff triple-double on Sunday, scoring 23 points with 10 rebounds and 10 assists in game in which Boston led by as many as 34 points in the fourth quarter. But the big question was how he would bounce back after getting undercut by Martin while going after a rebound.Tatum started Game 2 and had 14 points in the first quarter. And Martin was heartily booed every time he touched the ball.It only seemed to energize him and the Heat, who needed to win a play-in game to earn the right to face the Celtics.“He’s a competitor. He’s the ultimate X factor,” Spoelstra said. “He’s the X factor of X factors.”Miami led by five, 55-50, with two minutes left in the first half before Brown hit three straight 3-pointers to open a four-point lead. Brown missed a 3 the next time down, but his layup in the final seconds made it 61-58 at the half.Miami went on a 10-0 run to take an 82-70 lead with under four minutes to play in the third before the Celtics cut it to six.“We knew it wasn’t going to be easy,” Tatum said. “There’s a lot of history between these two franchises, especially recently. ... It’s never going to go exactly as people expect it to go and that’s the beauty of it.”AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",2024-04-25 06:02:48 AM EEST,NPR,"Herro scores 24, Heat hit franchise playoff-record 23 3s to beat Boston and even series 1-1",https://apnews.com/article/celtics-heat-score-61e988ee001918d56bc31f5900c1ec39

John Hanna,"TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Kansas’ Democratic governor on Wednesday vetoed a broad package of tax cuts for the second time in three months, describing it as “too expensive” despite the bipartisan support it enjoyed in the Republican-controlled Legislature.Gov. Laura Kelly and her staff had signalled that she had misgivings about a package of income, sales and property tax cuts worth $1.5 billion over the next three years. Her chief of staff said before it cleared the Legislature this month that it was larger than Kelly thought the state could afford in the long term. The governor also told fellow Democrats that she believes Kansas’ current three personal income tax rates ensure that the wealthy pay their fair share. The plan would have moved to two rates.The governor immediately proposed new tax cuts worth roughly $1.3 billion over the next three years, but the Kansas House’s top Republican immediately said the governor “isn’t serious” about tax relief. The Legislature was set to reconvene Thursday following a spring break and wrap up its work for the year in just six days.“While I appreciate the bipartisan effort that went into this tax cut package and support many of the provisions included, I cannot sign into law a bill that jeopardizes our state’s future fiscal stability,” Kelly wrote in her veto message. “This bill is too expensive.”Top Republican legislators have wanted to move Kansas to a single personal income tax rate, which at least five other GOP-led states have done since July 2021, according to the conservative Tax Foundation. But their dispute with Kelly over that idea has meant that Kansas hasn’t enacted big tax cuts, even as surplus funds have filled its coffers.In January, Kelly vetoed a plan to cut taxes by $1.6 billion over three years that Democrats largely opposed. It would have moved Kansas to a single-rate personal income tax, and Kelly argued it would have benefited the “super wealthy,” which Republicans disputed.“Kansans need and deserve tax relief, and Governor Kelly isn’t serious when she says she wants to provide it,” House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican, said in a statement.Democrats were split over the bill Kelly vetoed. In the Senate, they largely opposed it for the same reasons Kelly did, while in the House, no members voted against it.Overriding a veto requires two-thirds majorities in both chambers. The House’s top Democrat, state Rep. Vic Miller, of Topeka, said he likes Kelly’s new plan but doubts Republicans will embrace it, making the bill Kelly vetoed possibly the best that Democrats can expect.“I’m not sure I want to risk what she’s willing to risk,” he said of the governor.Kelly isn’t the only governor at odds with lawmakers over taxes. In neighboring Nebraska, Republican Gov. Jim Pillen said he’ll call a special legislative session over rising property taxes. The conservative Legislature there adjourned last week without passing Pillen’s plan to fund property tax relief by raising the state’s sales tax and applying it to more goods and services, including candy, soda and digital advertising.The bill Kelly vetoed also would eliminate income taxes on Social Security benefits, which kick in when a retiree earns $75,000 a year. It would reduce the state’s property taxes for public schools and eliminate an already-set-to-expire 2% sales tax on groceries six months early, on July 1.In moving Kansas from three personal income tax rates to two, it would drop the highest top rate from 5.7% to 5.55%.Kelly’s new plan includes the same sales tax and Social Security provisions, as well as a version of the property tax cut. Her plan would keep all three personal income tax rates and lower them. Her highest rate would be 5.65%.Last week, a new fiscal forecast provided a stable picture for state government through the end of June 2025. A separate projection from legislative researchers said that even with extra spending approved by lawmakers this year and the tax cuts Kelly vetoed, the state would end June 2025 with more than $3.7 billion in surplus. Kelly argues that problems would arrive in future years, though Republicans strongly disagree.Kelly won the first of her two terms in 2018 by running against the fiscal policies of a Republican predecessor, Gov. Sam Brownback. Big budget shortfalls followed large income tax cuts in 2012 and 2013 and continued until most of the cuts were repealed in 2017 over Brownback’s veto.But Republicans argue that warnings from Kelly hearkening back to Brownback’s policies have lost credibility as surplus revenues have piled up.“It’s far past time for the governor to put her worn-out Brownback rhetoric on the back burner and finally make our Kansas families the top priority,” House Taxation Committee Chair Adam Smith, a western Kansas Republican, wrote in a column Tuesday in the Kansas City Star.Associated Press writer Margery Beck in Omaha, Nebraska, also contributed to this story.",2024-04-24 23:51:38 PM EEST,NPR,Kansas’ governor vetoed tax cuts again over their costs.

None,"BOSTON (AP) — Massachusetts House leaders began debate Wednesday on a proposed $57.9 billion state budget for the 2025 fiscal year that would include $500 million for the state’s emergency shelter system and what lawmakers say is a record investment of $555 million for the beleaguered Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority.The $500 million for emergency shelters is about half of what Democratic Gov. Maura Healey said is likely needed for the program, which is straining in part because of an influx of migrants seeking shelter.Democratic House Speaker Ronald Mariano has said the $555 million investment in the MBTA — and another $184 million for regional transit authorities across the state — is key to the state’s economy.Mariano said the proposed funding would represent a 41% increase in transportation funding from the current fiscal year.The proposed investment relies in part on funds generated by the so-called “millionaire tax” ballot initiative that voters approved in November 2022, which established a 4% surtax on annual income above $1 million, according to Mariano.The proposed budget also includes $20 million for reduced MBTA fares for riders with lower incomes.Budget writers said they were able to create a balanced spending plan without dipping into the state’s rainy day fund. Under the plan, the fund is on track to top $9 billion, one of the biggest state rainy day funds in the country.Healey released her version of the state budget in January. Healey’s $58 billion plan included several proposals she previewed during her State of the Commonwealth address, including lowering the staggering cost of housing and childcare and making Massachusetts “the climate innovation lab for the world.”Healey said her proposal doesn’t rely on any new broad-based taxes and wouldn’t require a withdrawal from the state’s rainy day fund.It would spend a then-anticipated $1.3 billion raised from the voter-approved “millionaire tax” on transportation and education, including a universal school meals program and a low-income fare relief program for greater Boston’s public transit system.After the House votes on its budget proposal, the debate heads to the Senate, which will draft and vote on its own state budget plan.It will then be up to a six-member conference committee of House and Senate members to hammer out a single budget proposal to send back to each chamber for a final vote before shipping it to Healey’s desk.",2024-04-25 00:25:56 AM EEST,NPR,"Massachusetts House launches budget debate, including proposed spending on shelters, public transit",https://apnews.com/article/massachusetts-house-budget-transit-rainy-day-fund-a0495f10ad5bb9faaa449ca94a6394d2
David A. Lieb,"JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — The manufacturer of a popular weedkiller won support Wednesday from the Missouri House for a proposal that could shield it from costly lawsuits alleging it failed to warn customers its product could cause cancer.The House vote marked an important but incremental victory for chemical giant Bayer, which acquired an avalanche of legal claims involving the weedkiller Roundup when it bought the product’s original St. Louis-area-based producer, Monsanto.The legislation now heads to the Missouri Senate with several weeks remaining in the annual legislative session. Bayer pursued similar legislation this year in Idaho and Iowa, where it has mining and manufacturing facilities, but it fell short in both states.Bayer disputes claims that Roundup’s key ingredient, glyphosate, causes a cancer called non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. But it has set aside $16 billion and already paid about $10 billion of that amount to resolve some of the tens of thousands of legal claims against it.Though some studies associate glyphosate with cancer, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has said it is not likely to be carcinogenic to humans when used as directed.The Missouri legislation says that federally approved pesticide labeling “shall be sufficient to satisfy any requirement for a warning label regarding cancer” — effectively thwarting failure-to-warn allegations in future lawsuits.“We are grateful that members of the Missouri House have supported farmers and science over the litigation industry,” Bayer said in a statement Wednesday.A coalition that includes Bayer has run ads on radio stations, newspapers and billboards supporting the legislation.Farmers overwhelmingly rely on Roundup, which was introduced 50 years ago as a more efficient way to control weeds and reduce tilling and soil erosion. For crops including corn, soybeans and cotton, it’s designed to work with genetically modified seeds that resist Roundup’s deadly effect.More than a dozen majority party Republicans joined Democrats in voting against the legislation as it passed the House on a 91-57 vote. Some Democrats made personal pleas to vote no.“If you vote for this bill, you are voting for cancer — and it will hurt my feelings, and I will not smile at you on the elevator,” said state Rep. LaDonna Appelbaum, who is undergoing treatment for cancer.Supporters said it was important to protect Bayer, whose North American crop science division is based in the St. Louis area, from lawsuits that could jeopardized the availability of Roundup. They cited concerns that Bayer eventually could pull Roundup from the U.S. market, leaving farmers dependent on alternative chemicals from China.“This bill isn’t about cancer, it’s really about the process of what’s taken place within the courts,” said Republican state Rep. Mike Haffner, chair of the House Agriculture Policy Committee.",2024-04-24 23:41:21 PM EEST,NPR,Missouri House backs legal shield for weedkiller maker facing thousands of cancer-related lawsuits,https://apnews.com/article/bayer-glyphosate-roundup-lawsuits-cancer-db7fc5e0ce1584e45ff18aa76f23df25
Lisa Rathke,"The Vermont House approved a bill Wednesday that would require firearms that are privately made from individual parts, kits or by 3D printers to have serial numbers in an effort to crack down on so-called ghost guns, which are increasingly being used in crimes.Supporters of the measure in the Democratic-controlled Legislature say it’s critical for Vermont to keep the weapons out of the hands of people who aren’t allowed to have firearms. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed this week to take up a Biden administration appeal over the regulation of the difficult-to-trace ghost guns.The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has a rule in place that prohibits guns and gun components from lacking serial numbers, but the rule’s legality is being challenged and it might be overturned, state Rep. Angela Arsenault told House colleagues last week.“As a legislative body we have no such restrictions and since this rule may be struck down we need to act now to keep these protections in place,” she said.The Vermont bill includes penalties ranging from fines as low as $50 to prison time depending on the offense. A person who carries a firearm that lacks a serial number while committing a violent crime would face up to five years in prison, a maximum fine of $5,000, or both.Republican Gov. Phil Scott thinks the bill is moving in the right direction, “but doesn’t think most parts will actually have any real impact given the difficulty of enforcement of possession,” his spokesman, Jason Maulucci, said by email.The bill has its opponents. Chris Bradley, president of the Vermont Federation of Sportsmen’s Clubs, said it would be a tax on law-abiding gun owners who would have to get a gun serialized and undergo a background check.“It is only going to be encumbering on the citizens who will follow this law and will have no impact on criminals,” he said. “Criminals have been getting guns illegally ... stealing them, trading drugs for them, whatever.”But Arsenault said one of the primary drivers of the bill is that guns can be stolen.“A gunmaker may have no criminal intent whatsoever, but there is still a chance that that gun may one day be stolen, and therefore a serial number is just a manner of course for responsible gun ownership,” she said Wednesday.The House tacked on a provision to the Senate bill to address concerns about guns in municipal buildings, particularly during elections. The secretary of state’s office, in consultation with the Vermont League of Cities and Towns and the Vermont Municipal Clerks and Treasurers Association, would be required to report to the Legislature by next Jan. 15 on options for prohibiting firearms in municipal buildings, which some Republicans fear would lead to further gun restrictions.“Stop micromanaging our municipalities,” said Republican state Rep. Terri Williams, of Granby. “We sure would like to have local control. Not every district has the same needs.”",2024-04-25 00:14:50 AM EEST,NPR,Vermont House passes measure meant to crack down on so-called ghost guns,https://apnews.com/article/ghost-guns-vermont-serial-numbers-c1b68feb6bc2b4902dd1aef15003c710

He remained inside the Capitol for roughly 22 minutes.“After exiting the building, DiGiovanni did not leave the grounds but remained on the East Front steps where he celebrated, raising his arm in the air,” prosecutors wrote in a court filing.DiGiovanni pleaded guilty in January to entering or remaining within a restricted building or grounds, a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum of one year in prison.Prosecutors had recommended sentencing DiGiovanni to 30 days of imprisonment. Defense attorney Martin Minnella asked for no jail time.“As Benjamin Franklin once said, ‘It takes many good deeds to build a good reputation, and only one bad one to lose it.’ This is what Mr. DiGiovanni has endured since the outset of this case,” Minnella wrote.DiGiovanni “was merely a follower and did not intent to participate in any so-called insurrection,” Minnella said in a statement after Wednesday’s sentencing.“On behalf of Mr. DiGiovanni and his family, we are all grateful that this dark chapter in his life is now over,” the lawyer added.DiGiovanni is a contractor who owns a construction business. He has served as an alderman in Derby and ran for mayor of the city after the Capitol riot.More than 1,350 people have been charged with Capitol riot-related federal crimes. Over 800 of them have been sentenced, with roughly two-thirds receiving terms of imprisonment ranging from a few days to 22 years.",2024-04-25 00:10:30 AM EEST,NPR,Ex-Connecticut city official is sentenced to 10 days behind bars for storming US Capitol,https://apnews.com/article/gene-digiovanni-connecticut-alderman-capitol-riot-1887cecc18b0ecf2d13c968059a3d460

Cliff Brunt,"OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Just a few days ago, the Oklahoma City Thunder looked like a young team struggling through their first playoff game together.On Wednesday night, they looked like grizzled playoff veterans.Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 33 points and the top-seeded Thunder beat the New Orleans Pelicans 124-92 to take a 2-0 lead in their first-round Western Conference playoff series.Gilgeous-Alexander said the Thunder remained focused instead of worrying about outside issues such as other highly seeded teams struggling at home.“I think it just goes back to us prioritizing winning,” he said. “And all those things are distractions that get in the way of winning. And every night, all 15 of us go to bed and want to win the next game, want to win the next day. And we do everything we can to do so.”Chet Holmgren had 26 points and seven rebounds and Jalen Williams added 21 points for the Thunder, who shot 59% from the field and made 14 of 29 3-pointers.Jonas Valanciunas scored 19 points and Herb Jones and Brandon Ingram added 18 each for the Pelicans.In Game 1, Valanciunas had 20 rebounds, including nine offensive, and the Pelicans outrebounded the Thunder 52-44. On Wednesday, Oklahoma City outrebounded New Orleans 37-35 and held the Pelicans to eight offensive boards.The Pelicans continued to struggle on offense without top scorer Zion Williamson, who remained out with a strained left hamstring. Ingram, New Orleans’ No. 2 scorer in the regular season, got off just 10 shots in Game 2 as Oklahoma City’s Lu Dort harassed him throughout the night. Ingram made just 5 of 17 field goals in Game 1.The Thunder also scored 22 points off New Orleans’ 18 turnovers.Game 3 is Saturday in New Orleans.“Now, the challenge is to continue to grow and learn and improve with the series because the Pelicans are going to improve,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. “They’re a good team that’s going home and they’re well coached. They’re going to get better. You know so we have to continue to get better.”The pace picked up significantly from Sunday’s game, which Oklahoma City won 94-92. The Thunder, who averaged 120.1 points in the regular season, were much more comfortable with it.“In the first game, I thought both teams were kind of calibrating,” Daigneault said. “And, tonight we had much quicker recognition of the way that they were guarding us, where we wanted to attack, and we got to those things pretty well.”Valanciunas scored 11 points in the first three minutes, but Holmgren countered with 13 points in the first seven minutes.Gilgeous-Alexander picked up where Holmgren left off. He didn’t score for the first nine minutes, then scored seven in the final three minutes of the quarter to help the Thunder take a 35-22 lead. Holmgren’s 15 points were the most by a Thunder rookie in any quarter of a playoff game.“I thought they turned up the pressure offensively,” Pelicans coach Willie Green said. “They got some early 3’s and that opened the floodgates up for them.”Oklahoma City led 63-50 at halftime. Holmgren scored 20 points and Gilgeous-Alexander added 16 before the break.The Thunder extended their lead to 92-74 at the end of the third, and Gilgeous-Alexander and Holmgren went to the bench for good with the Thunder leading 120-86 in the fourth.“Tough one for us,” Green said. “Give them credit, they took care of home court.

Susan Haigh,"HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Connecticut’s first-in-the-nation paid sick leave law from 2011 moved closer Wednesday to being updated, requiring all employers, down to those with a single worker, to provide their employees with time off by 2027.Cheers were heard from the House of Representatives gallery after lawmakers voted 88-61 in favor of legislation that attempts to provide guaranteed time off to people left out of the old law, including many low-wage and part-time workers across the state. The bill is expected to clear the Senate in the coming days.Both chambers are controlled by Democrats.While Republicans argued the bill will be a burden for small businesses, proponents said the proposed expansion is common sense, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic.“We’ve experienced quite a culture change since 2011, and that’s especially true even more since we experienced the pandemic,” said Democratic House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, who said people no longer want themselves or a coworker to go into work sick. “People shouldn’t have to choose between being sick, making other people sick, and losing out on compensation.”If the bill is ultimately signed by Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont, as expected, Connecticut will join Washington, D.C., Arizona, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Vermont and Washington in requiring paid sick leave for any business with one or more employees.Republican House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora said that would be a mistake. He and other GOP lawmakers argued the bill will create a financial and bureaucratic hardship for small business owners and break the state’s recent cycle of economic growth.Connecticut’s current paid sick law generally requires certain employers with at least 50 employees to provide up to 40 hours of paid sick leave annually to “service workers” in certain specified occupations. This bill applies to all employees and affects employers with 25 or more workers beginning Jan. 1, 2025; 11 or more workers beginning Jan. 1, 2026; and one or more workers beginning Jan. 1, 2027.An employee would accrue one hour of paid sick leave for each 30 hours worked, for a maximum of 40 hours of paid leave per year.“We are now taking a giant leap and going to have a broad-brush impact every business throughout the entire state of Connecticut — and I don’t think people here appreciate or understand how it’s going to affect them,” Candelora said.The bill, the result of months of negotiations to ultimately get a proposal that could clear the House, was also criticized for being too lenient and not requiring workers to provide their employer with a doctor’s note.“This could be for somebody to take a day off and go to the beach,” said Republican Rep. Steve Weir of Hebron. “Let’s be honest. This not sick leave. It provides an unfunded mandate on our employers.”Lamont, a Democrat and former businessman, said he believes the bill strikes an appropriate balance between protecting the workforce and providing safeguards so the benefit is not misused and small business owners are protected.“Especially considering what we learned during the recent outbreak of a viral pandemic, it’s appropriate that we take a look at our existing paid sick days laws and evaluate how they are working and how we can strengthen them,” Lamont said in a statement.Lamont said he will sign the bill once it passes the Senate.",2024-04-25 01:31:57 AM EEST,NPR,Connecticut House votes to expand state’s paid sick leave requirement for all employers by 2027,https://apnews.com/article/connecticut-paid-sick-leave-4fcdac679b1b3ba21ca951a52747c339
Greg Beacham,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Reggie Bush has his Heisman back.The Heisman Trust reinstated the former Southern California tailback as the 2005 Heisman Trophy winner on Wednesday, citing fundamental changes in the structure of college athletics during the 14 years since Bush forfeited the trophy and the honor.Bush gave up his Heisman following an NCAA investigation that found he received what were impermissible benefits during his time with the Trojans. College football players are now allowed to profit from their work in many ways, and the Heisman Trust decided it was time to move past the conflict with one of the most exciting players in the sport’s history.“We are thrilled to welcome Reggie Bush back to the Heisman family in recognition of his collegiate accomplishments,” said Michael Comerford, president of The Heisman Trophy Trust. “We considered the enormous changes in college athletics over the last several years in deciding that now is the right time to reinstate the Trophy for Reggie. We are so happy to welcome him back.”The Heisman Trust has returned the trophy to Bush and the replica to USC. Bush also will be invited to all future Heisman Trophy ceremonies.Bush won the trophy awarded to the top player in college football after amassing 2,218 yards from scrimmage and scoring 18 touchdowns in 2005. His 784 first-place votes were the fifth most in Heisman history, and the trophy was a crowning achievement for Bush after three seasons at USC as one of the most dynamic college football players in decades.“I am grateful to once again be recognized as the recipient of the Heisman Trophy,” Bush said in a statement. “This reinstatement is not only a personal victory, but also a validation of the tireless efforts of my supporters and advocates who have stood by me throughout this arduous journey.”The reinstatement of Bush gives USC a total of eight Heisman winners, most of any school.USC typically displays its replicas of the Trojans’ Heisman Trophies in the lobby of Heritage Hall, its historic football headquarters, while the retired uniform numbers of its Heisman winners are displayed on huge banners draping the Peristyle at the Coliseum during USC home games. Bush’s No. 5 jersey is expected to be back among the honored numbers this fall.“What a historic day!” said USC coach Lincoln Riley, who coached Caleb Williams to the school’s most recent Heisman in 2022. “Reggie’s reintroduction to the Heisman Family is a special moment for every person that has been associated with USC football. We are thrilled that Reggie’s athletic accomplishments as one of the greatest to ever play the game can officially be recognized.”The USC football program wrote “back where it belongs "" in a social media post.“This is a momentous day for Reggie Bush and the entire USC community as we celebrate the rightful return of his Heisman Trophy,” USC athletic director Jen Cohen said. “Reggie’s impact at USC and on college football as a whole is truly unmatched. He has displayed the utmost resiliency and heart throughout this process and is so deserving of every accolade and trophy he’s ever received. We are grateful to the Heisman Trophy Trust for making this happen.”Bush had his award vacated in 2010 after USC was hit with massive NCAA sanctions when it was found that Bush and his family received money and gifts from fledgling marketing agents who were hoping to represent him. The sanctions were the final result of a prolonged, antagonistic dispute between the NCAA and USC under former athletic director Mike Garrett.USC received a two-year postseason ban and lost a whopping 30 scholarships under the sanctions. The NCAA also vacated 14 wins by the Trojans during the heart of Bush’s career, including the 55-19 victory over Oklahoma in the Bowl Championship Series title game at the Orange Bowl following the 2004 season.USC was even required to “disassociate” from Bush for 10 years following the NCAA’s decision. The school immediately ended its disassociation when that period ended in June 2020, welcoming Bush back to the school.The Trust said in its statement that its decision followed a “deliberative process” in which it closely monitored changes in the college athletics landscape. That included the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2021 decision that questioned the legality of the NCAA’s amateurism model and opened the door to athlete compensation; the ability of players to be paid for their name, image and likeness; and the NCAA’s recent proposal to remove the cap on education-related payments.“Recognizing that the compensation of student athletes is an accepted practice and appears here to stay, these fundamental changes in college athletics led the Trust to decide that now is the right time to return the Trophy to Bush, who unquestionably was the most outstanding college football player of 2005,” the Trust said.Public opinion has long favored the return of Bush’s trophy. Johnny Manziel, the 2012 Heisman winner from Texas A&M, said on social media last month that he would not participate in Heisman festivities unless Bush got his trophy back.Manziel thanked the Trust on Wednesday “for doing what’s right and welcoming a storied member of our history back into the fold. There were many voices throughout this process that stood on the table for Reggie simply because of the kind of human being he is. I look forward to being on that stage with you this December (Reggie Bush) you deserve it.”Among others praising the decision were Williams, the 2022 winner and the projected No. 1 pick in Thursday’s NFL draft; 2001 winner Eric Crouch of Nebraska; and 2011 winner Robert Griffin III of Baylor.Bush was the No. 2 overall pick in the 2006 NFL draft by New Orleans, and he played for five teams over 11 seasons. He is now a commentator and studio analyst for Fox Sports.Last August, Bush filed a defamation lawsuit against the NCAA for issuing a statement to media in 2021 that said Bush had a “pay-for-play” arrangement. That statement was in response to media inquiries about whether Bush would have his statistics from his USC career reinstated when NIL payments became permissible. Bush contended the statement cast him in a false light.“I want to make it abundantly clear that I have always acted with integrity and in accordance with the rules and regulations set forth by the NCAA,” Bush said Wednesday. “The allegations brought against me were unfounded and unsupported by evidence, and I am grateful that the truth is finally prevailing.”AP College Football Writer Eric Olson in Omaha, Nebraska, contributed to this report.AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-football-poll and https://apnews.com/hub/college-football",2024-04-25 04:07:03 AM EEST,NPR,"Reggie Bush is reinstated as 2005 Heisman Trophy winner, with organizers citing NIL rule changes",https://apnews.com/article/heisman-reggie-bush-5ec9ed713534ca1081a0777b699d0385
Morgan Lee,"SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — County commissioners in rural New Mexico extended authorization for a migrant detention facility Wednesday in cooperation with federal authorities over objections by advocates for immigrant rights who allege inhumane conditions and due process violations at the privately operated Torrance County Detention Facility.The 3-0 vote by the Torrance County commission clears the way for a four-month extension through September of an agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for the detention of migrants at the facility.At a public meeting, advocates renewed criticism that the facility has inadequate living conditions and provides limited access to legal counsel for asylum-seekers who cycle through. Critics of the detention center have urged federal immigration authorities to end their contract with a private detention operator, while unsuccessfully calling on state lawmakers to ban local government contracts for migrant detention.The ACLU announced Tuesday that it had uncovered documents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that show a 23-year-old Brazilian migrant didn’t receive adequate mental health care prior to his suicide in August 2022 at the Torrance County Detention Facility after being denied asylum. Contacted by email Wednesday, ICE representatives had no immediate response to the allegations by the ACLU.The ACLU urged federal authorities reconsider its contract the Torrance County facility based on a “mortality review” by ICE’s health services corps of circumstances leading up to the death of Kelsey Vial during the migrant’s monthslong detention. The document describes Vial’s symptoms and treatment for depression while awaiting removal to Brazil and concludes that detention center staff “did not provide Mr. Vial’s health care within the safe limits of practice.”County Commissioner Sam Schropp said events described by the ACLU took place nearly two years ago and don’t reflect current conditions at the facility that he has witnessed during his own unannounced visits. He described numerous accounts of desperation among migrants related to food, water and health care access within the facility as “hearsay.”“The accounts which you attribute to the federal government will not be changed by closing of (the Torrance County Detention Facility). Those detainees will be moved to another facility and there will be no one like me appearing,” Schropp said.The ACLU’s Mike Zamore petitioned a top ICE official to conduct a new review of the detention center before extending the contract beyond May.“While this review continues, ICE should let the contract for Torrance expire,” wrote Zamore, national director of policy and government affairs for the ACLU. “From a good governance perspective, it makes no sense to renew a contract for operations that have repeatedly resulted in dangerous conditions and chronic violation of federal standards.”The detention center at Estancia can accommodate at least 505 adult male migrants at any time, though actual populations fluctuate.Torrance County Manager Janice Barela said federal authorities proposed terms of the four-month extension of the services agreement for immigrant detention. County government separately contracts for jail space unrelated to immigration at the detention center, which is the county’s largest payer of property taxes.",2024-04-25 02:20:05 AM EEST,NPR,County in rural New Mexico extends agreement with ICE for immigrant detention amid criticism,https://apnews.com/article/new-mexico-migrant-detention-facility-extension-032e5695f94490e6a2ff9b06b2cfc8da

Susan Haigh,"HARTFORD (AP) — The Connecticut Senate pressed ahead Wednesday with one of the first major legislative proposals in the U.S. to rein in bias in artificial intelligence decision-making and protect people from harm, including manufactured videos or deepfakes.The vote was held despite concerns the bill might stifle innovation, become a burden for small businesses and make the state an outlier.The bill passed 24-12 after a lengthy debate. It is the result of two years of task force meetings in Connecticut and a year’s worth of collaboration among a bipartisan group of legislators from other states who are trying to prevent a patchwork of laws across the country because Congress has yet to act.“I think that this is a very important bill for the state of Connecticut. It’s very important I think also for the country as a first step to get a bill like this,” said Democratic Sen. James Maroney, the key author of the bill. “Even if it were not to come and get passed into law this year, we worked together as states.”Lawmakers from Connecticut, Colorado, Texas, Alaska, Georgia and Virginia who have been working together on the issue have found themselves in the middle of a national debate between civil rights-oriented groups and the industry over the core components of the legislation. Several of the legislators, including Maroney, participated in a news conference last week to emphasize the need for legislation and highlight how they have worked with industry, academia and advocates to create proposed regulations for safe and trustworthy AI.But Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding said he felt like Connecticut senators were being rushed to vote on the most complicated piece of legislation of the session, which is scheduled to adjourn May 8. The Republican said he feared the bill was “full of unintended consequences” that could prove detrimental to businesses and residents in the state.“I think our constituents are owed more thought, more consideration to this before we push that button and say this is now going to become law,” he said.Besides pushback from Republican legislators, some key Democrats in Connecticut, including Gov. Ned Lamont, have voiced concern the bill may negatively impact an emerging industry. Lamont, a former cable TV entrepreneur, “remains concerned that this is a fast-moving space, and that we need to make sure we do this right and don’t stymie innovation,” his spokesperson Julia Bergman said in a statement.Among other things, the bill includes protections for consumers, tenants and employees by attempting to target risks of AI discrimination based on race, age, religion, disability and other protected classes. Besides making it a crime to spread so-called deepfake pornography and deceptive AI-generated media in political campaigns, the bill requires digital watermarks on AI-generated images for transparency.Additionally, certain AI users will be required to develop policies and programs to eliminate risks of AI discrimination.The legislation also creates a new online AI Academy where Connecticut residents can take classes in AI and ensures AI training is part of state workforce development initiatives and other state training programs. There are some concerns the bill doesn’t go far enough, with calls by advocates to restore a requirement that companies must disclose more information to consumers before they can use AI to make decisions about them.The bill now awaits action in the House of Representatives.",2024-04-25 04:16:44 AM EEST,NPR,Connecticut Senate passes wide-ranging bill to regulate AI.

Paul Wiseman,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Coming off a robust end to 2023, the U.S. economy is thought to have extended its surprisingly healthy streak at the start of this year, with consumers still spending freely despite the pressure of high interest rates.The Commerce Department is expected to report Thursday that the gross domestic product — the economy’s total output of goods and services — grew at a slow but still-decent 2.2% annual pace from January through March, according to a survey of forecasters by the data firm FactSet.Some economists envision a stronger expansion than that. A forecasting model issued by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta points to a first-quarter annual pace of 2.7%, propelled by a 3.3% increase in consumer spending, the principal driver of economic growth.Either way, the economy’s growth is widely expected to have decelerated from the vigorous 3.4% annual pace of October through December. The slowdown reflects, in large part, the much higher borrowing rates for home and auto loans, credit cards and many business loans that have resulted from the 11 interest rate hikes the Federal Reserve imposed in its drive to tame inflation.Even so, the United States has continued to outpace the rest of the world’s advanced economies. The International Monetary Fund has projected that the world’s largest economy will grow 2.7% for all of 2024, up from 2.5% last year and more than double the growth the IMF expects this year for Germany, France, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and Canada.Americans, who emerged from the pandemic recession with plenty of money in reserve, have been spending energetically, a significant trend because consumers account for roughly 70% of the nation’s GDP. From February to March, retail sales surged 0.7% — almost double what economists had expected.Businesses have been pouring money into factories, warehouses and other buildings, encouraged by federal incentives to manufacture computer chips and green technology in the United States. On the other hand, their spending on equipment has been weak. And as imports outpace exports, international trade is also thought to have been a drag on the economy’s first-quarter growth.Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF’s managing director, cautioned last week that the “flipside’’ of strong U.S. economic growth was that it was ”taking longer than expected” for inflation to reach the Fed’s 2% target, although price pressures have sharply slowed from their mid-2022 peak.Inflation flared up in the spring of 2021 as the economy rebounded with unexpected speed from the COVID-19 recession, causing severe supply shortages. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 made things significantly worse by inflating prices for the energy and grains the world depends on.The Fed responded by aggressively raising its benchmark rate between March 2022 and July 2023. Despite widespread predictions of a recession, the economy has proved unexpectedly resilient. Economic growth has come in at a 2% annual rate for six straight quarters — seven, if forecasters are correct about the January-March GDP growth.Hiring so far this year is even stronger than it was in 2023. And unemployment has remained below 4% for 26 straight months, the longest such streak since the 1960s.“Overall, US economic activity remains resilient, powered by consumers’ ongoing ability and willingness to spend,’' said Gregory Daco, chief economist at the tax and consulting firm EY. ”A robust labor market, along with positive real wage growth, continues to provide a solid foundation.’'Inflation, the main source of Americans’ discontent about the economy, has slowed from 9.1% in June 2022 to 3.5%. But progress has stalled lately. Republican critics of President Joe Biden have sought to pin the blame for high prices on the president and use it as a cudgel to derail his re-election bid. Polls show that despite a healthy job market, a near-record-high stock market and the sharp slowdown in inflation, many Americans blame Biden for high prices.Though the Fed’s policymakers signaled last month that they expect to cut rates three times this year, they have lately signaled that they’re in no hurry to reduce rates in the face of continued inflationary pressure. Now, a majority of Wall Street traders don’t expect them to start until the Fed’s September meeting, according to the CME FedWatch tool.AP Economics Writer Christopher Rugaber contributed to this report.",2024-04-25 07:01:06 AM EEST,NPR,US growth likely slowed last quarter but still pointed to a solid economy,https://apnews.com/article/economy-growth-inflation-gdp-consumers-federal-reserve-5a64d255a09313dabe54954060a09530
Adam Beam,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Doctors, hospitals and health insurance companies in California will be limited to annual price increases of 3% starting in 2029 under a new rule state regulators approved Wednesday in the latest attempt to corral the ever-increasing costs of medical care in the United States.The money Californians spent on health care went up about 5.4% each year for the past two decades. Democrats who control California’s government say that’s too much, especially since most people’s income increased just 3% each year over that same time period.The 3% cap, approved Wednesday by the Health Care Affordability Board, would be phased in over five years, starting with 3.5% in 2025. Board members said the cap likely won’t be enforced until the end of the decade.A new state agency, the Office of Health Care Affordability, will gather data to enforce the rule. Providers who don’t comply could face fines.“We want to be aggressive,” board chair Dr. Mark Ghaly said, while acknowledging that the cap “really translates into a major challenge” for the health care industry.The vote is just the start of the process. Regulators will later decide how the cost target will be applied across the state’s various health care sectors. And enforcement will be progressive, with several chances for providers to avoid fines.California’s health care industry has supported the idea of a statewide cost target but argued a 3% cap is too low and will be nearly impossible to meet. In December, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services said the cost to practice medicine in the United States would increase 4.6% this year alone.The board based the target on the average annual change in median household income in California between 2002 and 2022, which was 3%. Dr. Tanya W. Spirtos, president of the California Medical Association that represents doctors, wrote a letter to the board noting that number is “artificially low” because it includes the years of the Great Recession, when income dropped dramatically. She said a better gauge would be looking at the past 10 years, when median household income increased an average of 4.1% per year.Hospitals argue much of what they charge is outside of their control. More than half of hospitals’ expenses are salaries for workers, and many of those are set through collective bargaining agreements with labor unions. Plus, a new state law that takes effect this year will gradually increase the minimum wage for health care workers to $25 per hour.More than half of California’s 425 hospitals are losing money, and many rural facilities are in danger of closing — prompting the state Legislature last year to approve an emergency loan program.Carmela Coyle, president and CEO of the California Hospital Association, said when it comes to hospital finances, “the fat is already gone.” She said hospitals regularly perform complex procedures that save lives, including quadruple bypass surgeries.“We’re fooling ourselves if we think that’s cheap or can be done less expensively,” she said.Health care spending in the United States has more than doubled in the past two decades, reaching $4.5 trillion in 2022, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Eight other states have set statewide cost targets for their health care industries. What makes California’s cap different, experts say, is both the staggering size of the state’s health care industry and its plan to enforce the limit with fines.Health providers could exceed the cap if they have a good reason, including giving raises to health care workers. Those issues have yet to be worked out and will be considered on a case by case basis.California has greatly expanded access to health insurance in recent years, including using taxpayer money to provide deep discounts for some middle-income earners and offering free coverage to all low-income adults regardless of their immigration status. State lawmakers have resisted more ambitious actions, including a single-payer system.“Making quality health care affordable is a top priority for our administration,” Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement released by his office. “This action is a crucial first step forward in our efforts to reign in outrageous heath care costs and make health care more affordable.”Wednesday’s vote was the state’s first foray into tackling health care spending in California, which reached $405 billion in 2020, or $10,299 per person — the 22nd highest in the nation. Still, costs have increased greatly for people who get health insurance through their job. In 2006, just 6% of California workers who had deductibles of $1,000 or more. By 2020, it was 54%.“We have a system right now that the incentives are not about getting the most cost efficient service,” said Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access California who advised the board on the new cost limit. “This is an attempt to try to have that incentive into a market that is more about getting bigger than about getting better.”",2024-04-25 02:49:33 AM EEST,NPR,New California rule aims to limit health care cost increases to 3% annually,https://apnews.com/article/california-health-care-costs-target-cap-0aefad8c177ed3e0447dc4e17258be08
Jeffrey Collins,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — The South Carolina Senate approved its budget Wednesday after debating items like requiring school children use the bathrooms of their sex assigned at birth and whether universities can spend state money to move to another athletic conference.The $15.4 billion budget for next fiscal year raises salaries for state employees and teachers, sets aside more money to improve and repair roads and bridges and doubles a planned income tax cut to 0.2%.It also sets up a showdown with the House over the next month or beyond as the House’s $500 million property tax rebate is not in the Senate plan.A group of three House members and three senators — likely including the leaders of each chamber’s budget committee — is going to have to sort out the differences. Last year, there was a monthlong showdown over how much money should be given to a new veterinary school at Clemson University.Late Wednesday, senators added a one-year provision to the budget requiring students use the bathroom of their sex assigned at birth and stay during overnight field trips in rooms of people of the same sex.All the Republicans voting supported the proposal. Democrats said passing the idea over just a few minutes of debate instead of through a regular bill was dangerous.“This will clearly subject our state to legal action. We are willfully wasting taxpayer dollars to defend against something that will be found unconstitutional,” said Democratic Sen. Tameika Isaac Devine of ColumbiaSenators also on Wednesday night took up what many see as a problem with charter school operators using state money for themselves instead of education, limiting to 2% the amount schools can use for administration.“They are hiring employees of the schools they authorize as consultants,” Democratic Sen. Nikki Setzler of West Columbia said. “It is wrong what is going on. And they don’t think this General Assembly is going to do anything.”Senators debated small parts of the spending plan for well over a dozen hours over two days as the main framework of the spending plan for the 2024-25 fiscal year was hammered out in the Senate Finance Committee earlier this month.They approved an amendment prohibiting universities from spending state money on entry fees, exit fees or outside attorney expenses if they try to change conferences. Clemson University is suing the Atlantic Coast Conference — its home for sports for 71 years — challenging what the school calls the league’s “exorbitant $140 million” exit fee.Senators also required county libraries to provide detailed plans on how they will keep inappropriate material out of the hands of children or lose any state funding. Supporters said they won’t punish libraries if a child sees adult material.“They need to certify they have a plan. They aren’t throwing this stuff on the shelf and saying have at it,” said Republican Sen. Josh Kimbrell of Spartanburg, the amendment’s sponsor.Instead of $500 million in a property tax rebate, the Senate plan chooses to spend $100 million to knock the income tax rate most people pay in the state from 6.4% to 6.2% The state is in the middle of a five-year effort to cut its top income tax rate from 7% to 6% and this cuts the time to four years.Senators would spend the rest of that money on roads and bridges, local water and sewer system repairs, and other items.The $500 million comes from an account meant to provide property tax relief. Sales tax goes into the fund, and a boom in spending during and after the COVID-19 pandemic has left the account flush with cash.The House budget suggested giving the money back as a property tax rebate. But county officials worry property tax bills will snap back next year and homeowners will be angry at them.Another difference in the House and Senate budgets is how much of a raise is given to state employees. The Senate plan would give state employees making less than $50,000 a raise of $1,375 a year. Workers making more than that would get a 2.75% boost in pay. The House plan gives a $1,000 raise to workers making less than $66,667 and a 1.5% raise to those who make more.Items both chambers agreed on including $200 million in teacher raises. Every teacher would get a pay bump and the minimum salary for a starting teacher would be increased to $47,000 a year. The budget also would allow teachers to get a yearly raise for each of their first 28 years instead of their first 23.The debate ran so long that senators brought in dinner Wednesday night. After a 40-minute break to eat sandwiches, a few senators withdrew their amendments, including Democratic Sen. Margie Bright Matthews of Walterboro, who had a weight loss drug proposal.“Since we’ve eaten I would move to withdraw that,” Matthews said to laughter.“If I had known that, we would have eaten earlier,” Republican Senate President Thomas Alexander of Walhalla responded.",2024-04-25 05:20:09 AM EEST,NPR,South Carolina Senate approves $15.4B budget after debate on bathrooms and conference switching,https://apnews.com/article/south-carolina-senate-budget-tax-cut-bathrooms-86a7fef9cd4b052da1de6c0d3d69a69d
"Jacques Billeaud,Josh Kelety,Jonathan J. Cooper","PHOENIX (AP) — An Arizona grand jury has indicted former President Donald Trump ‘s chief of staff Mark Meadows, lawyer Rudy Giuliani and 16 others for their roles in an attempt to overturn Trump’s loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 election.The indictment released Wednesday names 11 Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring that Trump won Arizona in 2020. They include the former state party chair, a 2022 U.S. Senate candidate and two sitting state lawmakers, who are charged with nine counts each of conspiracy, fraud and forgery.The identities of seven other defendants, including Giuliani and Meadows, were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the documents. They were readily identifiable based on descriptions of the defendants, however.Trump himself was not charged but was referred to as an unindicted co-conspirator.With the indictments, Arizona becomes the fourth state where allies of the former president have been charged with using false or unproven claims about voter fraud related to the election. Heading into a likely November rematch with Biden, Trump continues to spread lies about the last election that are echoed by many of his supporters.“I will not allow American democracy to be undermined,” Democratic state Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. “It’s too important.”The indictment alludes to Giuliani as an attorney “who was often identified as the Mayor” and spread false allegations of election fraud. Another defendant is referred to as Trump’s “ chief of staff in 2020,” which describes Meadows.Descriptions of other unnamed defendants point to Mike Roman, who was Trump’s director of Election Day operations; John Eastman, a lawyer who devised a strategy to try to persuade Congress not to certify the election; and Christina Bobb, a lawyer who worked with Giuliani.A lawyer for Eastman, Charles Burnham, said his client is innocent. Bobb did not respond to a text message seeking comment, nor did a lawyer who is representing Roman in a case in Georgia.George Terwilliger, a lawyer representing Meadows, said he had not yet seen the indictment but if Meadows is named, “it is a blatantly political and politicized accusation and will be contested and defeated.” Giuliani’s political adviser, Ted Goodman, decried what he called “the continued weaponization of our justice system.”The 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona’s Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were “duly elected and qualified” electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.Biden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden’s victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans.Their lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and “failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.”Days after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 participated in the certificate signing.The Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.In December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.Michigan’s Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.Three fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.In Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden’s victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.Trump was indicted in August in federal court over efforts to cling to power after his defeat, including the fake electors scheme. The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday will hear arguments on his claim in that case that he can’t be prosecuted for acts he committed while serving as president.In early January, New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez said that state’s five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.In Arizona, Mayes’ predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes’ office.The so-called fake electors facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP’s chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona’s 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, past president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.In a statement, Hoffman accused Mayes of weaponizing the attorney general’s office in bringing the case but didn’t directly comment on the indictment’s allegations.“Let me be unequivocal, I am innocent of any crime, I will vigorously defend myself, and I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this naked political persecution by the judicial process,” Hoffman said.None of the others responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.Associated Press writers Gabe Stern and Scott Sonner in Las Vegas, Kate Brumback in Atlanta and Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, contributed to this report.",2024-04-25 06:34:05 AM EEST,NPR,"Arizona indicts 18 in election interference case, including Giuliani and Meadows",https://apnews.com/article/arizona-fake-electors-charges-2020-election-9da5a7e58814ed55ceea1ca55401af85
Annie Ma,"Columbia University president Minouche Shafik is no stranger to navigating complex international issues, having worked at some of the world’s most prominent global financial institutions.At the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, for example, she tackled both the European debt crisis and the Arab Spring.It remains to be seen, however, if her experience with world conflicts has sufficiently equipped her to navigate the thorny challenges she faces amid ongoing student protests over the Israel-Hamas war.“The reason you protest is to call attention to an issue,” said Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education. “And you do that by challenging the normal order of things. It’s not a problem to be solved, but a tension to be managed.”The task before her — to balance the demands of students, faculty and politicians — is also a reflection of just how complex governing universities has become in this day and age, when college footprints have grown ever larger, observers say. And it echoes the experience of a growing number of university leaders who, like Shafik, come from nonacademic backgrounds.Thus far, it seems no one is happy with Shafik’s responses to the protests that began last week at Columbia.Her decision to ask New York City police to intervene, resulting in the arrests of more than 100 protesters, only served to motivate the demonstrators, who quickly regrouped — and to inspire other students at campuses around the country.Shafik initially appeared to have weathered the grilling by Republican lawmakers who have expressed growing concern about antisemitism on college campuses. She struck a more conciliatory tone before the House Education and Workforce Committee than the presidents of Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania, who were forced to step down after they were widely criticized for emphasizing free speech protections during their appearances before the same panel.But Columbia’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors responded angrily to her congressional testimony, accusing her of capitulating to demands from lawmakers who they said made “slanderous assaults” on faculty and students. The AAUP submitted a motion of censure against Shafik. While it does not call for her resignation and is largely symbolic, it reflects the intensity of anger on campus toward her actions.And now lawmakers are piling on again.Republicans in New York’s delegation to the U.S. House on Monday wrote a letter urging Shafik to resign, saying she had failed to provide a safe learning environment in recent days as “anarchy has engulfed the campus.” During a visit to Columbia on Wednesday, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson called for Shafik to resign “if she cannot bring order to this chaos.”In a written statement to Congress preceding her in-person testimony, Shafik described a childhood in Egypt and then in the Southeast as schools were desegregating, saying those experiences gave her the skills necessary “to engage with and learn from people with a wide array of backgrounds and experience overcoming discrimination firsthand.”But that may not be enough; Shafik’s position at Columbia also appears to require a fair amount of political finesse.It’s not only that she must try to balance principles of free speech and academic freedom with creating a safe environment on campus. Like other college presidents these days, she also is charged with balancing the pillars of shared governance between the faculty, the board and the administration, said Katherine Cho, assistant professor of higher education at Loyola University Chicago.“Oftentimes, all three groups have different ideas of what the college is and how well the president is doing their job ... and the president might have a different definition of how they think that they’re successful,” Cho said.When she arrived at Columbia last year, Shafik was the first woman to take on the role of president and one of several women newly appointed to take the reins at Ivy League institutions.Her experience in finance, rather than academia, puts her in line with more and more university leaders who come from nonfaculty backgrounds.After obtaining her master’s degree at the London School of Economics, she went on to earn a doctorate at Oxford University. She rose through the ranks at the World Bank, eventually becoming the bank’s youngest-ever vice president.Shafik also worked at the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development, followed by stints at the International Monetary Fund and the Bank of England, before taking over the leadership of the London School of Economics.At the time of Shafik’s appointment, Columbia Board of Trustees chair Jonathan Lavine described her as a leader who deeply understood “the academy and the world beyond it.”“What set Minouche apart as a candidate,” Lavine said in a statement, “is her unshakable confidence in the vital role institutions of higher education can and must play in solving the world’s most complex problems.”Shafik also framed her international experience as foundational to her leadership of Columbia in her testimony to lawmakers.“These experiences have shown me that education is the single most powerful tool to make our communities and our world better,” she said in her written statement. “And, amid these challenging times, I believe it is important for the Columbia community to realize the powerful impact of our core educational mission.”The Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

"David Sharp,Patrick Whittle","AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) — A U.S. Army reservist who sounded the clearest warning ahead of Maine’s deadliest mass shooting is expected to answer questions Thursday from the commission investigating the tragedy.Six weeks before Robert Card killed 18 people at a bar and bowling alley in Lewiston, his best friend and fellow reservist Sean Hodgson texted their supervisors, telling them to change the passcode to the gate at their Army Reserve training facility and arm themselves if Card showed up.“I believe he’s going to snap and do a mass shooting,” Hodgson wrote on Sept. 15.That message came months after relatives had warned police that Card had grown paranoid and said they were concerned about his access to guns. The failure of authorities to remove guns from Card’s possession in the weeks before the shooting has become the subject of a monthslong investigation in the state, which also has passed new gun safety laws since the tragedy.Card also was hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital for two weeks in July, and the Army barred him from having weapons while on duty. But aside from briefly staking out the reserve center and visiting Card’s home, authorities declined to confront him. He was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound two days after the shootings.In an interim report released last month, the independent commission launched by Gov. Jane Mills concluded that the Sagadahoc County sheriff’s office had probable cause under Maine’s “yellow flag” law to take Card into custody and seize his guns. It also criticized police for not following up with Hodgson about his warning text.On Thursday, the commission plans to hear from the state’s director of victim witnesses services. Hodgson told The Associated Press he is scheduled to be questioned Thursday morning.In an exclusive series of interviews in January, Hodgson told The AP he met Card in the Army Reserve in 2006 and that they became close friends after both divorced their spouses around the same time. They lived together for about a month in 2022, and when Card was hospitalized in New York in July, Hodgson drove him back to Maine.Growing increasingly worried about his friend’s mental health, Hodgson warned authorities after an incident in which Card started “flipping out” after a night of gambling, pounding the steering wheel and nearly crashing multiple times. After ignoring his pleas to pull over, Card punched him in the face, Hodgson said.“It took me a lot to report somebody I love,” he said. “But when the hair starts standing up on the back of your neck, you have to listen.”Some officials downplayed Hodgson’s warning, suggesting he might have been drunk because of the late hour of his text. Army Reserve Capt. Jeremy Reamer described him as “not the most credible of our soldiers” and said his message should be taken “with a grain of salt.”Hodgson said he struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder and alcohol addiction but said he wasn’t drinking that night and was awake because he works nights and was waiting for his boss to call.",2024-04-25 07:02:43 AM EEST,NPR,Army reservist who warned about Maine killer before shootings to testify before investigators,https://apnews.com/article/lewiston-maine-mass-shooting-920d81187803c24a038f442b6f9f4dd5
None,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — Alabama was one of 14 states that declined to participate in a federal program that gives summer food assistance to low-income families with school age children, prompting advocates on Wednesday to urge lawmakes to reverse course and join the program.At a public hearing on the proposed education budget, several organizations urged legislators to set aside funding for Alabama to participate in 2025.“Every child deserves the chance to grow learn and dream without the burden of hunger weighing them down,” Rhonda Mann, executive director of VOICES for Alabama’s Children told the Finance and Taxation-Education Committee.The program called Summer EBT, or Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer Program, provides families $40 per month for each child receiving free and reduced-price school lunches. That would be about $120 to spend on groceries over the summer break. The program is intended to augment existing summer meal sites to help combat food insecurity in the summer months.Alabama participated in the pandemic version of the program. Congress in 2022 made the program permanent effective this summer, but Alabama has declined to take part in the permanent program. States split the administrative costs of running the program but the benefits are federally funded.A spokeswoman for Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey on Wednesday cited cost concerns when asked if Alabama plans to participate.“Alabama fully participated in the program during the pandemic years, the time for which the program was created and intended. Now, in 2024, the pandemic is behind us, and federal changes have significantly increased the state’s cost to administer it,” Gina Maiola, a spokeswoman for Ivey wrote in an email.The governor’s office did not provide an estimate of administrative costs.Alabama Arise, an advocacy group for low-income families, estimated that it would take $10 million to $15 million in administrative and start-up costs for Alabama to participate in 2025, but that amount would decrease in future years. LaTrell Clifford Wood, a hunger policy advocate with Alabama Arise, urged lawmakers to set aside the funds in the $9.3 billion Education Trust Fund budget.“Summer EBT is an opportunity that our state simply can’t afford to pass up. We urge lawmakers to make this investment in a healthier future for Alabama’s children,” Clifford Wood said.The Alabama House of Representatives last week tabled an amendment that would have set aside money for the program. State Rep. Danny Garrett, the chairman of the House budget-writing committee, told representatives that he wants to learn more about what is required of the state before appropriating funds.One state senator said he will fight to secure funding when the appropriations bill comes up for a vote.“We are going to feed these children or they are going to drag me from that microphone,” Sen. Rodger Smitherman, D-Birmingham, said.",2024-04-25 01:11:02 AM EEST,NPR,"Groups urge Alabama to reverse course, join summer meal program for low-income kids",https://apnews.com/article/summer-ebt-alabama-legislature-bbbb00d0b07f48334acba46c0d262b4b
Ellen Knickmeyer,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A former senior U.S. official who until recently helped oversee human-rights compliance by foreign militaries receiving American military assistance said Wednesday that he repeatedly observed Israel receiving “special treatment” from U.S. officials when it came to scrutiny of allegations of Israeli military abuses of Palestinian civilians.The allegation comes as the Biden administration faces intense pressure over its ally’s treatment of Palestinian civilians during Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. And matters because of who said it: Charles O. Blaha. Before leaving the post in August, he was a director of a State Department security and human rights office closely involved in helping ensure that foreign militaries receiving American military aid follow U.S. and international humanitarian and human rights laws.Blaha said his departure from the State Department after decades of service was not related to the U.S.-Israeli security relationship. He is the second senior State official involved in that relationship to assert that when it comes to Israel, the U.S. is reluctant to enforce laws required of foreign militaries receiving American aid.“In my experience, Israel gets special treatment that no other country gets,” Blaha said. “And there is undue deference, in many cases, given” to Israeli officials’ side of things when the U.S. asks questions about allegations of Israeli wrongdoing against Palestinians, he added.He spoke to reporters at an event where he and other members of an unofficial, self-formed panel of former senior U.S. civilian and military officials released a report pointing to civilian deaths in specific airstrikes in Gaza. They said there was “compelling and credible” evidence that Israeli forces had acted illegally.Blaha’s comments echoed those of another State Department official and panel member, Josh Paul. Paul resigned as a director overseeing arms transfers to other countries’ militaries in October in protest of the U.S. rushing arms to Israel amid its war in Gaza.Asked about the allegations from the two, a State Department spokesman, Vedant Patel, said “there is no double standard, and there is no special treatment.”Israeli officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Israel consistently says it follows all laws in its use of U.S. military aid, investigates allegations against its security forces and holds offenders accountable.Israel historically is the United States’ biggest recipient of military aid, and Biden on Wednesday signed legislation for an additional $26 billion in wartime assistance. But Biden has come under growing pressure over that support as Palestinian deaths mount.The latest Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7, when Hamas and Islamic Jihad, two militant groups backed by Iran, carried out a cross-border attack that killed 1,200 people in Israel. Israel responded with an offensive in Gaza that has caused widespread devastation and killed more than 34,000 people, according to local health officials.In coming days, the administration says it will announce its official findings from reviews it did into allegations of especially serious human rights abuses by specific Israeli military units. Those units would be barred from receiving U.S. military aid if the U.S. review confirms those allegations.Separately, the Biden administration also is expected to disclose by May 8 whether it has verified assurances from Israel that the country is not using U.S. military aid in a way that violates international or human rights law. Both Israel’s written assurance and the U.S. verification were mandated by a new presidential national security memo that Biden issued in February.The February agreement was negotiated between the Biden administration and members of his own Democratic Party, who had been pushing for the U.S. to begin conditioning military aid to Israel on improving treatment of Palestinian civilians.Panel members released their report Wednesday to urge the U.S. to scrutinize specific attacks in Gaza that the former officials argued should lead to a conclusion that Israel was wrong when it confirmed it was complying with the laws. If that determination is made, the U.S. could then suspend military aid.Wednesday’s unofficial report points to 17 specific strikes on apartments, refugee camps, private homes, journalists and aid workers for which the former U.S. officials and independent experts allege there’s no evidence of the kind of military target present to justify the high civilian death tolls.They include an Oct. 31 airstrike on a Gaza apartment building that killed 106 civilians, including 54 children. Israeli officials offered no reason for the strike, and a Human Rights Watch probe found no evidence of a military target there, the officials said. Israel has said in many of the instances that it is investigating.",2024-04-25 00:44:09 AM EEST,NPR,Another ex-State Department official alleges Israeli military gets ‘special treatment’ on abuses,https://apnews.com/article/us-israel-military-aid-international-law-1e9b612631a7c20438053189c3b62187
"Kimberlee Kruesi,Jonathan Mattise","NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee’s Republican-dominant House on Wednesday spiked legislation that would have banned local governments from paying to either study or dispense money for reparations for slavery.The move marked a rare defeat on a GOP-backed proposal initially introduced nearly one year ago. It easily cleared the Republican-controlled Senate last April, but lawmakers eventually hit pause as the House became consumed with controversy over expelling two Black Democratic lawmakers for their participating in a pro-gun control protest from the House floor. That protest followed a deadly elementary school shooting in Nashville.Interest in the reparations bill emerged again this year, just as lawmakers and GOP Gov. Bill Lee were in the process of finalizing the removal and replacement of every board member of the state’s only publicly-funded historically Black public university, Tennessee State University. That sparked more outrage among critics who contend that Tennessee’s white GOP state leaders have long refused to trust Black local leaders.As the TSU fallout increased, House members appeared hesitant to hold a potentially explosive debate over reparations. The bill was briefly debated on the House floor last week but support remained unclear.“The idea of studying reparations doesn’t take anything from you,” Democratic Rep. Larry Miller, who is Black and from Memphis, said during the short House debate. “What’s inside of you to say, ‘Look, we can’t study our history. We can’t even talk about our history, you can’t even use your local tax dollars to study it.’ That is so antiquated.”Ultimately, House leaders waited until the final week of session to return to the measure. But as Republican Rep. John Ragan, the bill’s sponsor, approached the front of the House to begin his opening remarks, another Republican requested that the body “table” his proposal — a move that would effectively kill it for the year.Nearly 30 Republicans joined House Democrats in tabling the bill, including Republican House Speaker Cameron Sexton.Ahead of the vote, Ragan maintained his bill was needed, arguing that reparations advocates want to “take money from our grandchildren’s pockets as a judgement for someone else’s great-great-grandfather’s actions.”“Is it right to say that the faults of a small percentage of long-past generations must be borne by all of today’s Americans? No. It’s never right to punish an innocent person for an act committed by another,” Ragan said Wednesday.Under House rules, no other lawmakers were allowed to speak during the vote.“We decided move on, go accomplish some other stuff,” Sexton later told reporters. “You can always come back.”Tennessee lawmakers began seriously considering banning the consideration of reparations only after the state’s most populated county, which encompasses Memphis, announced it would spend $5 million to study the feasibility of reparations for the descendants of slaves and find “actionable items.”The decision by Shelby County leaders was prompted by the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols by officers in January 2023.Yet the idea to ban reparations has been floated in other states.A Florida Republican lawmaker proposed a constitutional amendment this year that would have banned state or local governments from paying reparations, but the measure didn’t pass. A Missouri Republican introduced a bill that would ban any state or local government entity from spending on reparations based on race, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation or economic class. It hasn’t advanced to date.Meanwhile, other states have willingly moved to study reparations, including California, New Jersey and Vermont.",2024-04-25 02:27:06 AM EEST,NPR,"Tennessee House kills bill that would have banned local officials from studying, funding reparations",https://apnews.com/article/reparations-ban-tennessee-republicans-71259e52fe4c7c98d49905fd0c18da50
Geoff Mulvihill,"Action in courts and state capitals around the U.S. this week have made it clear again: The overturning of Roe v. Wade and the nationwide right to abortion did not settle the issue.One iteration of the issue was back before the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday for the second time in a month.Meanwhile, Arizona lawmakers took a step toward repealing a near-total ban before enforcement can begin; California’s governor pitched providing an outlet to abortion providers and patients from neighboring Arizona if that ban takes take effect; and Tennessee moved closer to criminalizing helping a minor go out of state for an abortion without parental consent.Here’s what to know about the latest developments.Three Republican lawmakers joined Democrats in the Arizona House to advance a bill repealing an abortion ban that was first put on the books in 1864, decades before Arizona became a state.Democrats, including Gov. Katie Hobbs, had been pushing for a repeal since the Arizona Supreme Court ruling earlier this month that found the ban can be enforced since Roe v. Wade’s overturning. Republicans had used procedural moves to block a vote on a repeal, which appears to have enough support to pass the state Senate.The state’s attorney general, also a Democrat, said enforcement won’t begin until at least June 8.There’s been pressure on Arizona lawmakers to repeal from the state’s governor, President Joe Biden, and the governor of neighboring state California. Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday announced a measure that would allow doctors from Arizona to provide abortions for Arizona patients in California.Under the proposed California legislation, Arizona providers could work in California without additional licenses though November.Fourteen other states are already enforcing bans on abortion in all stages of pregnancy. But California has not proposed this kind of help for any of them, possibly because none shares a border with it.At least one ballot measure on abortion could be before Arizona voters in November in the political battleground state.The conservative majority of the U.S. Supreme Court, which overturned Roe v. Wade less than two years ago, seemed skeptical about the Biden administration’s contention in arguments Wednesday that Idaho should be forced to allow abortion during medical emergencies.The administration argued that a federal law that requires care hospitals that accept Medicaid provide emergency care even when patients cannot pay means that hospitals must also provide abortions in emergency situations when a patient’s health is at serious risk.Idaho’s exceptions are narrower than that, allowing abortion only when the woman’s life is at risk.It was the second time in a month that abortion was before the high court. It’s also considering whether to roll back the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s approvals for a drug that’s often used in combination with a second drug for medication abortions — which are now the most common method of abortion in the U.S.Rulings on both cases are expected by June.With a state Senate vote Wednesday, Tennessee became the second state to give full legislative passage to a measure banning taking a minor out of the state without parental consent to obtain an abortion.If Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, signs it into law, it would impact only the part of the journey in Tennessee — not the actual crossing of a state line.Abortion is banned in all stages of pregnancy in Tennessee and five of the eight states it borders.Idaho passed a similar law last year, but a court has put enforcement on hold because of a legal challenge. A Tennessee law would also likely also face court challenges.California’s governor has also fought against this measure and others like it that were proposed in other states, launching an ad campaign against them earlier this year.Maine Gov. Janet Mills on Monday signed a bill making her state at least the 14th with a law intended to protect those who provide abortion for out-of-state patients from legal action in those other states.Maine’s law will take effect in the summer.It’s a reminder that abortion policy has flowed in two directions since the end of Roe v. Wade in 2022: Most GOP-dominated states have sought to tighten access, while most Democrat-controlled ones have moved to protect or expand it.Like several of the others, Maine’s measure also applies to gender-affirming health care. In addition to imposing abortion bans or restrictions, most Republican-controlled states have also adopted bans on gender-affirming care for transgender minors.",2024-04-25 07:13:26 AM EEST,NPR,US abortion battle rages on with moves to repeal Arizona ban and a Supreme Court case,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-restrictions-protections-arizona-supreme-court-92af95ce79753e226c0fa7de2a02431e
Ellen Knickmeyer,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A memorial at the National Cathedral in Washington on Thursday will honor the seven World Central Kitchen aid workers killed by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza earlier this month.José Andrés, the celebrity chef and philanthropist behind the Washington-based World Central Kitchen disaster relief group, is expected to speak at the celebration of life service, and famed cellist Yo-Yo Ma will perform, organizers said.The Biden administration said Thursday that Douglas Emhoff, husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, and U.S. Assistant Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell would be among senior administration figures attending.The aid workers were killed April 1 when a succession of Israeli armed drones ripped through vehicles in their convoy as they left one of World Central Kitchen’s warehouses on a food delivery mission. Those who died were Palestinian Saifeddin Issam Ayad Abutaha; Britons John Chapman, James Kirby and James Henderson; dual U.S.-Canadian citizen Jacob Flickinger; Australian Lalzawmi Frankcom; and Polish citizen Damiam Sobol.After an unusually swift investigation, Israel said the military officials involved in the strike had violated policy by acting based on a single grainy photo that one officer had contended — incorrectly — showed one of the seven workers was armed. The Israeli military dismissed two officers and reprimanded three others.The aid workers, whose trip had been coordinated with Israeli officials, are among more than 220 humanitarian workers killed in the six-month-old Israel-Hamas war, according to the United Nations. That includes at least 30 killed in the line of duty.The international prominence and popularity of Andres and his nonprofit work galvanized widespread outrage over the killings of the World Central Kitchen workers. The slayings intensified demands from the Biden administration and others that Israel’s military change how it operates in Gaza to spare aid workers and Palestinian civilians at large, who are facing a humanitarian crisis and desperately need aid from relief organizations as the U.N. warns of looming famine.World Central Kitchen, along with several other humanitarian aid agencies, suspended work in Gaza after the attack. “We haven’t given up,” World Central Kitchen spokesperson Linda Roth said last week. “We are in funeral mode right now.”Religious leaders of a range of faiths are set to participate in Thursday’s services. Funerals were held earlier in the workers’ home countries.AP writer Menelaos Hadjicostis in Nicosia, Cyprus, contributed to this report.",2024-04-25 07:15:09 AM EEST,NPR,World Central Kitchen workers killed by Israeli strikes in Gaza will be honored at memorial,https://apnews.com/article/memorial-world-central-kitchen-workers-gaza-israel-fd668fad5de83377c129ab832d699c70
Mark Sherman,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court has scheduled a special session to hear arguments over whether former President Donald Trump can be prosecuted over his efforts to undo his 2020 election loss to President Joe Biden.The case, to be argued Thursday, stems from Trump’s attempts to have charges against him dismissed. Lower courts have found he cannot claim immunity for actions that, prosecutors say, illegally sought to interfere with the election results.The Republican ex-president has been charged in federal court in Washington with conspiring to overturn the 2020 election, one of four criminal cases he is facing. A trial has begun in New York over hush money payments to a porn star to cover up an alleged sexual encounter.The Supreme Court is moving faster than usual in taking up the case, though not as quickly as special counsel Jack Smith wanted, raising questions about whether there will be time to hold a trial before the November election, if the justices agree with lower courts that Trump can be prosecuted.The justices ruled earlier this term in another case that arose from Trump’s actions following the election, culminating in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The court unanimously held that states could not invoke a provision of the 14th Amendment known as the insurrection clause to prevent Trump from appearing on presidential ballots.Here are some things to know:When the justices agreed on Feb. 28 to hear the case, they put the issue this way: “Whether and if so to what extent does a former President enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office.”That’s a question the Supreme Court has never had to answer. Never before has a former president faced criminal charges so the court hasn’t had occasion to take up the question of whether the president’s unique role means he should be shielded from prosecution, even after he has left office.Both sides point to the absence of previous prosecutions to undergird their arguments. Trump’s lawyers told the court that presidents would lose their independence and be unable to function in office if they knew their actions in office could lead to criminal charges once their terms were over. Smith’s team wrote that the lack of previous criminal charges “underscores the unprecedented nature” of what Trump is accused of.Richard Nixon resigned the presidency in disgrace nearly 50 years ago rather than face impeachment by the House of Representatives and removal from office by the Senate in the Watergate scandal.Both Trump’s lawyers and Smith’s team are invoking Nixon at the Supreme Court.Trump’s team cites Nixon v. Fitzgerald, a 1982 case in which the Supreme Court held by a 5-4 vote that former presidents cannot be sued in civil cases for their actions while in office. The case grew out of the firing of a civilian Air Force analyst who testified before Congress about cost overruns in the production of the C-5A transport plane.“In view of the special nature of the President’s constitutional office and functions, we think it appropriate to recognize absolute Presidential immunity from damages liability for acts within the ‘outer perimeter’ of his official responsibility,” Justice Lewis Powell wrote for the court.But that decision recognized a difference between civil lawsuits and “the far weightier” enforcement of federal criminal laws, Smith’s team told the court. They also invoked the high court decision that forced Nixon to turn over incriminating White House tapes for use in the prosecutions of his top aides.And prosecutors also pointed to President Gerald Ford’s pardon of Nixon, and Nixon’s acceptance of it, as resting “on the understanding that the former President faced potential criminal liability.”The subtext of the immunity fight is about timing. Trump has sought to push back the trial until after the election, when, if he were to regain the presidency, he could order the Justice Department to drop the case. Prosecutors have been pressing for a quick decision from the Supreme Court so that the clock can restart on trial preparations. It could take three months once the court acts before a trial actually starts.If the court hands down its decision in late June, which would be the typical timeframe for a case argued so late in the court’s term, there might not be enough time to start the trial before the election.Trump is represented by D. John Sauer, a former Rhodes Scholar and Supreme Court clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia. While serving as Missouri’s solicitor general, Sauer won the only Supreme Court case he has argued until now, a 5-4 decision in an execution case. Sauer also filed legal briefs asking the Supreme Court to repudiate Biden’s victory in 2020.In addition to working for Scalia early in his legal career, Sauer also served as a law clerk to Michael Luttig when he was a Republican-appointed judge on the Richmond, Virginia-based federal appeals court. Luttig joined with other former government officials on a brief urging the Supreme Court to allow the prosecution to proceed. Luttig also advised Vice President Mike Pence not to succumb to pressure from Trump to reject some electoral votes, part of Trump’s last-ditch plan to remain in office.The justices are quite familiar with Sauer’s opponent, Michael Dreeben. As a longtime Justice Department official, Dreeben argued more than 100 cases at the court, many of them related to criminal law. Dreeben was part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and joined Smith’s team last year after a stint in private practice.In Dreeben’s very first Supreme Court case 35 years ago, he faced off against Chief Justice John Roberts, then a lawyer in private practice.Of the nine justices hearing the case, three were nominated by Trump — Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. But it’s the presence of a justice confirmed decades before Trump’s presidency, Justice Clarence Thomas, that’s generated the most controversy.Thomas’s wife, Ginni Thomas, urged the reversal of the 2020 election results and then attended the rally that preceded the Capitol riot. That has prompted calls for the justice to step aside from several court cases involving Trump and Jan. 6.But Thomas has ignored the calls, taking part in the unanimous court decision that found states cannot kick Trump off the ballot as well as last week’s arguments over whether prosecutors can use a particular obstruction charge against Capitol riot defendants. Trump faces the same charge in special counsel Jack Smith’s prosecution in Washington.",2024-04-23 21:45:39 PM EEST,NPR,What to know in the Supreme Court case about immunity for former President Trump,https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-trump-immunity-prosecution-capitol-riot-9fd5dc5947dab82bbd18d3efcb4267d8
"Eric Tucker,Alanna Durkin Richer,Mark Sherman","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court is hearing arguments this week with profound legal and political consequences: whether former President Donald Trump is immune from prosecution in a federal case charging him with plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 election.In addition to establishing a potentially historic ruling about the scope of presidential power, the court’s decision — whenever it comes — will undoubtedly go a long way in determining a trial date for Trump in one of the four criminal prosecutions that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee faces.A quick decision in the Justice Department’s favor could conceivably put the case on track for trial this fall. But if the court takes until late June to resolve the question, then the likelihood rises substantially that the November presidential election will happen without a jury ever being asked to decide whether Trump is criminally responsible for efforts to undo an election he lost in the weeks leading up to the violent Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.A look at what’s ahead:A straightforward but legally untested question: whether a former president is immune from federal prosecution for official acts.Trump is the first ex-president to face criminal charges, making his appeal the first time in the country’s history that the Supreme Court has had occasion to weigh in on this issue.Though Justice Department policy prohibits the indictment of a sitting president, there’s no bar against charging a former one. Special counsel Jack Smith’s team says the Founding Fathers never intended for presidents to be above the law and that, in any event, the acts Trump is charged with — including participating in a scheme to enlist fake electors in battleground states won by President Joe Biden — aren’t in any way part of a president’s official duties.Trump’s lawyers, by contrast, say former presidents are entitled to absolute immunity. They warn of a potential floodgate of prosecutions against former presidents if they’re not entitled to immunity and say the office cannot function if the commander-in-chief has to be worried about criminal charges. And they cite a previous Supreme Court ruling that presidents are immune from civil liability for official acts, saying the same analysis should apply in a criminal context.The Supreme Court will actually be the third set of judges to address the question in the last six months.Trump’s lawyers last October asked U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, the trial judge overseeing the case, to dismiss the indictment on presidential immunity grounds.The judge squarely rejected Trump’s claims of absolute immunity, saying in December that the office of the presidency does not confer a “lifelong ‘get-out-of-jail-free’ pass.”An appeals court in February held the same, with a three-judge panel saying that for the purposes of this case, “former President Trump has become citizen Trump, with all of the defenses of any other criminal defendant.”Trump appealed to the high court, which after several weeks, announced that it would consider “whether and if so to what extent does a former President enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office.”The justices have multiple paths to decide the case. They’ll probably meet in private a short time after arguments to take a preliminary vote on the outcome. Chief Justice John Roberts would be a prime candidate to take on the opinion for the court, assuming he is in the majority.They could simply reject Trump’s immunity claim outright, permitting the prosecution to move forward and returning the case to Chutkan to set a trial date.They could also reverse the lower courts by declaring for the first time that former presidents may not be prosecuted for conduct related to official acts during their time in office. Such a decision would stop the prosecution in its tracks.There are other options, too, including ruling that former presidents do retain some immunity for their official actions but that, wherever that line is drawn, Trump’s actions fall way beyond it.Yet another possibility is that the court sends the case back to Chutkan with an assignment to decide whether the actions Trump is alleged to have taken to stay in power constitute official acts.A court ruling in Trump’s favor should have no bearing on the hush-money trial now underway in New York in part because that state-level case involves actions Trump took before he became president. And though Trump’s lawyers have made the same immunity argument in a federal case in Florida charging him with hoarding classified documents, that case accuses Trump of illegally retaining the records and obstructing efforts to get them back after he left office — rather than during his presidency.How quickly the court moves after arguments could depend on how much agreement there is among the justices. Unanimous opinions almost always take less time to write than those that sharply divide the court.If the justices rule against Trump and in favor of the government, the case would be returned to Chutkan, who would then be empowered to restart the clock on trial preparations and set a trial date.Any trial would still be several months away, in part because of Chutkan’s decision last December to effectively freeze the case pending the outcome of Trump’s appeal. She’s also committed to giving prosecutors and defense lawyers time to get ready for trial if the case returns to her court.That means that outstanding legal disputes that have been unresolved for months will again take center stage, not to mention new arguments and court fights that have yet to even surface but will also take up time on the calendar.The trial is likely to take months, meaning it would likely threaten to run up against the election if it doesn’t begin by August. Smith’s team has said the government’s case should take no longer than four to six weeks, but that doesn’t include any defense Trump could put on. And jury selection alone could take weeks.The timing of the trial — and whether Trump will be forced to sit in a Washington courtroom in the weeks leading up to the election — carries enormous political ramifications.If Trump secures the GOP nomination and defeats Biden in November, he could potentially try to order a new attorney general to dismiss the federal cases against him or he could even seek a pardon for himself — though that is a legally untested proposition.Smith’s team didn’t mention the election in its filing urging the Supreme Court to reject Trump’s effort to further delay the case. But prosecutors noted that the case has “unique national importance,” adding that “delay in the resolution of these charges threatens to frustrate the public interest in a speedy and fair verdict.”Trump, meanwhile, has accused Smith of trying to rush the case to trial for political reasons. Trump’s lawyers told the Supreme Court in their filing that holding the trial “at the height of election season will radically disrupt President Trump’s ability to campaign against President Biden — which appears to be the whole point of the Special Counsel’s persistent demands for expedition.”",2024-04-22 20:52:18 PM EEST,NPR,Supreme Court will decide whether Trump is immune from federal prosecution.

"Amanda Seitz,Rebecca Boone,Mark Sherman","WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Supreme Court heard its first test on Wednesday of state abortion bans that have been enacted since the court upended the Roe v. Wade constitutional right to abortion. While the current case involves an Idaho abortion ban, the court’s ruling could have implications beyond that state.Idaho lawmakers have banned abortion except when a mother’s life is at risk. The Biden administration says the state law conflicts with a federal law requiring emergency room doctors to stabilize patients, no matter what, even if that means an abortion.How the court will rule is uncertain. The justices could make a major ruling — or they could rule narrowly on how Idaho’s state law interacts with the federal law, the the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act ( EMTALA ).A look at the key points in Wednesday’s arguments.Attorneys for both sides warned that the justices’ ruling could affect women and doctors far beyond Idaho, changing how emergency rooms treat patients in many other states.“There are 22 states with abortion laws on the books,” said Attorney Joshua N. Turner, who represented Idaho. “This isn’t going to end with Idaho. … This question is going to come up in state after state.”Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, arguing for the Biden administration, cautioned that other states could pass laws limiting how emergency rooms offer other services, which could mean trouble for more patients when they go to a hospital.“This effectively allows states to take any particular treatment they don’t want their hospitals to provide and dump those patients out of state,” she warned. “And you can imagine what would happen if every state started to take this approach.”Medical “what-ifs” peppered the arguments, sometimes turning personal: What if a woman’s water breaks early in her pregnancy, exposing her to serious infection risk at a point when the fetus can’t survive outside the womb? What if continuing the pregnancy would subject a pregnant person to organ failure, or cause permanent infertility?Idaho’s Turner told the court that those would be “very case by case” situations – a response that left Justice Amy Coney Barrett “shocked.”Barrett, one of the conservatives who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, pressed Turner on when a prosecutor might bring charges against a doctor for providing an abortion. Experts whom Turner had cited, Barrett said, had told the court that doctors who performed abortions in those cases would be protected.Turner agreed and said that doctors in Idaho could use their “good faith,” medical judgment but Barrett pressed him further.“What if the prosecutor thought differently?” Barrett asked. “What if the prosecutor thought, well, I don’t think any good faith doctor could draw that conclusion.”Justice Sonia Sotomayor, part of the court’s liberal minority, asked Turner to consider how the federal law requires hospitals to treat patients for more common medical emergencies, like the diabetes that she has had since childhood.What if, she said, the state banned treating diabetes with insulin?“Federal law would say you can’t do that,’” said Sotomayor. “Objective medically accepted standards of care require the treatment of diabetics with insulin. Idaho is saying unless the doctor can say that this person’s death is likely, as opposed to serious illness, they can’t perform abortion.”Conservative Justice Samuel Alito was particularly alarmed by Idaho’s argument that emergency rooms could be forced to provide abortions if a pregnant patient in mental distress demanded one. The state has only raised this as a hypothetical, and not provided an actual example of a doctor being in this position.“Does health mean only physical health or does it also mean mental health?” Alito asked Prelogar, noting that he was trying to get her on the record about it if future incidents arise.Prelogar said it’s not the administration’s view that an abortion would be provided as emergency medical care if a woman was suicidal or depressed. She said that the hospital would be required to treat such patients in other ways, dealing with their mental health episode.“That could never lead to pregnancy termination because that is not the accepted standard of practice to treat any mental health emergency,” Prelogar said.Congress passed its federal law mandating that emergency rooms stabilize or treat patients in 1986, after reports that private hospitals were offloading patients – many of them without health insurance and in bad condition – on public hospitals.Nearly 40 years later, the attorneys and justices spent some of Wednesday diving into why Congress crafted the law.Justice Brett Kavanaugh pressed Prelogar on why the law was initially created. Idaho’s officials have argued that the law was supposed to ensure patients without health insurance were treated, and should not be used as a way for the federal government to police whether doctors perform abortions in an emergency.“The text of the statute which says in no uncertain terms, here is the fundamental guarantee: If you have an emergency medical condition and you go to an ER in this country, they have to stabilize you,” Prelogar said.But Turner raised another conundrum for the court about Congress’ intent: Why would doctors be required to perform abortions when the text of the law calls on them to treat “unborn children.”“It would be a strange thing for Congress to have regard for the unborn child and yet also be mandating termination of unborn children,” he told the court.It’s unclear exactly where the Supreme Court will land, but the court had earlier allowed Idaho’s abortion ban to be fully enforced while litigation continues.That means at least five members of the court voted to put on hold a lower court’s ruling that the federal law overrides Idaho’s abortion ban in medical emergencies. So the Biden administration was facing a tough road in persuading the court to uphold that ruling.Six conservative justices all have cast votes to limit abortion access, including five who voted less than two years ago to overturn Roe v. Wade.Justices Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Alito seemed most likely to side with Idaho on Wednesday. The liberal justices, Ketanji Brown Jackson, Kagan and Sotomayor were most favorable to the administration.The outcome likely turns on the votes of the other three members of the court — Chief Justice John Roberts and Barrett and Kavanaugh.Barrett and Kavanaugh voted to overturn Roe.——Boone reported from Boise, Idaho.",2024-04-25 01:29:46 AM EEST,NPR,Key moments in the Supreme Court’s latest abortion case that could change how women get care,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-idaho-state-bans-health-care-06ce8d1870db6864496ce281b6a3e77a
Mark Sherman,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court agreed on Monday to take up a Biden administration appeal over the regulation of difficult-to-trace ghost guns that had been struck down by lower courts.The justices by a 5-4 vote had previously intervened to keep the regulation in effect during the legal fight. Ghost guns, which lack serial numbers, have been turning up at crime scenes with increasing regularity.The regulation, which took effect in 2022, changed the definition of a firearm under federal law to include unfinished parts, like the frame of a handgun or the receiver of a long gun, so they can be tracked more easily. Those parts must be licensed and include serial numbers. Manufacturers must also run background checks before a sale, as they do with other commercially made firearms.The requirement applies regardless of how the firearm was made, meaning it includes ghost guns made from individual parts or kits or by 3D printers. The rule does not prohibit people from buying a kit or any type of firearm.The Justice Department had told the court that local law enforcement agencies seized more than 19,000 ghost guns at crime scenes in 2021, a more than tenfold increase in just five years.U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor, in Fort Worth, Texas, struck down the rule last year, concluding that it exceeded the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’ authority. O’Connor wrote that the definition of a firearm in federal law does not cover all the parts of a gun. Congress could change the law, he wrote.A panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals made up of three appointees of then-President Donald Trump largely upheld O’Connor’s ruling.The Supreme Court allowed the regulation to remain in effect while the lawsuit continues. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined with the court’s three liberal members to form the majority. Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas would have kept the regulation on hold during the appeals process.Barrett, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh were appointed by Trump.Arguments won’t take place before the fall.Follow the AP’s coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court.",2024-04-22 17:31:02 PM EEST,NPR,"Supreme Court will take up the legal fight over ghost guns, firearms without serial numbers",https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-ghost-guns-regulation-1a29729cf1bee46590d82ac46ab7b8f4
"Darlene Superville,Chris Megerian","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden picked up the endorsement of North America’s Building Trades Unions at a Wednesday event where the president and his allies set out to dismantle Republican Donald Trump’s reputation as a successful real estate developer.“Donald Trump is incapable of running anything,” said Sean McGarvey, the organization’s president. “God help us if he gets anywhere near the White House in the future.”The event, held in a Washington hotel ballroom with a boisterous crowd of union members, was another salvo in the battle for votes from blue collar workers. Trump has tried to chip away at Democrats’ traditional advantage with organized labor, while Biden has been adding to his roster of endorsements and trying to fend off his predecessor’s comeback bid.Biden said unions would help him make Trump a “loser again,” and he mocked Trump’s inability to pass infrastructure legislation when he was president, saying “he never built a damn thing.”The Democratic president repeatedly torched his likely Republican opponent as a callous businessman who turned firing people into entertainment as part of his long-running reality show “The Apprentice.”“He looks down on us. I’m not joking. Think about it,” Biden said. “Think about the guys you grew up with that you’d like to get in the corner and just give him a straight left. I’m not suggesting you hit the president. But we all know those guys growing up.”Biden recently campaigned in his childhood hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, and he’s increasingly used economic arguments to portray Trump as out of touch with workers’ concerns.In this election, Biden said, “it’s either Scranton values or Mar-a-Lago values.”The endorsement adds to Biden’s considerable union support. The United Auto Workers backed him in January, and the United Steelworkers Union followed suit in March.A Trump campaign spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But Trump has also sought support from organized labor, including meeting with the Teamsters earlier this year.“Usually a Republican wouldn’t get that endorsement,” Trump said. “But in my case it’s different because I’ve employed thousands of Teamsters and I thought we should come over and pay our respects.”Trump’s popularity with white working class voters has been a challenge for Democrats who puzzle over his appeal.McGarvey promised “an unprecedented field program in key battleground states” to help defeat Trump this year.",2024-04-24 21:38:53 PM EEST,NPR,"Biden picks up another big union endorsement, this one from building trades workers",https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-union-endorsement-651dd9dd2eb8e16ab898366e9501dc4e
"Mary Clare Jalonick,Stephen Groves,Farnoush Amiri","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate has passed $95 billion in war aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, sending the legislation to President Joe Biden after months of delays and contentious debate over how involved the United States should be in foreign wars.The bill passed the Senate on an overwhelming 79-18 vote late Tuesday after the House had approved the package Saturday. Biden, who worked with congressional leaders to win support, said in a statement immediately after passage that he will sign it Wednesday and start the process of sending weapons to Ukraine, which has been struggling to hold its front lines against Russia.“Tonight, a bipartisan majority in the Senate joined the House to answer history’s call at this critical inflection point,” Biden said.The legislation would also send $26 billion in wartime assistance to Israel and humanitarian relief to citizens of Gaza, and $8 billion to counter Chinese threats in Taiwan and the Indo-Pacific. U.S. officials said about $1 billion of the aid could be on its way shortly, with the bulk following in coming weeks.In an interview with The Associated Press shortly before the vote, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said that if Congress hadn’t passed the aid, “America would have paid a price economically, politically, militarily.”“Very few things we have done have risen to this level of historic importance,” he said.On the Senate floor, Schumer said the Senate was sending a message to U.S. allies: “We will stand with you.”Schumer and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made passage of the legislation a top priority, agreeing to tie the Ukraine and Israel aid to help ensure passage and arguing there could be dire consequences for the United States and many of its global allies if Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aggression is left unchecked. They worked with House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, to overcome seemingly intractable Republican opposition to the Ukraine aid, in particular — eventually winning large majorities in both chambers.McConnell said in a separate interview before the vote that it “is one of the biggest days in the time that I’ve been here.”“At least on this episode, I think we turned the tables on the isolationists,” McConnell said.In the end, 31 Republicans voted for the aid package — nine more than when the Senate passed a similar version in February, and a majority of the Senate GOP conference. The House approved the package in a series of four votes on Saturday, with the Ukraine portion passing 311-112.The $61 billion for Ukraine comes as the war-torn country desperately needs new firepower and as Russian President Vladimir Putin has stepped up his attacks. Ukrainian soldiers have struggled as Russia has seized the momentum on the battlefield and gained significant territory.Bidentold Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday the U.S. will send badly needed air defense weaponry as soon as the legislation is passed.“The President has assured me that the package will be approved quickly and that it will be powerful, strengthening our air defense as well as long-range and artillery capabilities,” Zelenskyy said in a post on X on Monday.In an effort to gain more votes, Republicans in the House majority also added a bill to the foreign aid package that could ban the social media app TikTok in the U.S. if its Chinese owners do not sell their stake within a year. That legislation had wide bipartisan support in both chambers.The TikTok bill was one of several tweaks Johnson made to the package the Senate passed in February as he tried to move the bill through the House despite significant opposition within his conference. Other additions include a stipulation that $9 billion of the economic assistance to Ukraine is in the form of “forgivable loans""; provisions that allow the U.S. to seize frozen Russian central bank assets to rebuild Ukraine; and bills to impose sanctions on Iran, Russia, China and criminal organizations that traffic fentanyl.Those changes appears to have brought some of the nine additional Senate Republicans on board, bringing support to more than half of McConnell’s conference.South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a longtime hawk who voted against the foreign aid package in February because it wasn’t paired with legislation to stem migration at the border, was one of the Republicans who switched their votes. “If we don’t help Ukraine now, this war will spread, and Americans who are not involved will be involved,” Graham said.The package has had broad congressional support since Biden first requested the money last summer. But congressional leaders had to navigate strong opposition from a growing number of conservatives who question U.S. involvement in foreign wars and argue that Congress should be focused instead on the surge of migration at the U.S.-Mexico border.Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, a Republican who is a close ally to Donald Trump, said that despite the strong showing of support for funding Ukraine’s defense, opposition is growing among Republicans.“The United States is spread too thin,” Vance said, “And that argument, I think, is winning the American people and it’s slowly winning the Senate, but it’s not going to happen overnight.”The growing fault line in the GOP between those conservatives who are skeptical of the aid and the more traditional “Reagan Republicans” who strongly support it may prove to be career-defining for the two top Republican leaders.McConnell, who has made the Ukraine aid a top priority, said last month that he would step down from leadership after becoming increasingly distanced from many in his conference on the Ukraine aid and other issues. Johnson, who said he put the bills on the floor after praying for guidance, faces threats of an ouster after a majority of Republicans voted against the aid to Ukraine.Johnson said after House passage that “we did our work here, and I think history will judge it well.”Opponents in the Senate, like the House, included some left-wing senators who are opposed to aiding Israel as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has bombarded Gaza and killed thousands of civilians. Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., voted against the package.“We must end our complicity in this terrible war,” Sanders said.",2024-04-24 06:04:35 AM EEST,NPR,"Senate overwhelmingly passes aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan with big bipartisan vote",https://apnews.com/article/israel-ukraine-aid-tiktok-senate-8fe738b17e5c4b2636bc0de11b2620b7
Haleluya Hadero,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate passed legislation Tuesday that would force TikTok’s China-based parent company to sell the social media platform under the threat of a ban, a contentious move by U.S. lawmakers that’s expected to face legal challenges and disrupt the lives of content creators who rely on the short-form video app for income.The TikTok legislation was included as part of a larger $95 billion package that provides foreign aid to Ukraine and Israel and was passed 79-18. It now goes to President Joe Biden, who said in a statement immediately after passage that he will sign it Wednesday.A decision made by House Republicans last week to attach the TikTok bill to the high-priority package helped expedite its passage in Congress and came after negotiations with the Senate, where an earlier version of the bill had stalled. That version had given TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, six months to divest its stakes in the platform. But it drew skepticism from some key lawmakers concerned it was too short of a window for a complex deal that could be worth tens of billions of dollars.The revised legislation extends the deadline, giving ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok, and a possible three-month extension if a sale is in progress. The bill would also bar the company from controlling TikTok’s secret sauce: the algorithm that feeds users videos based on their interests and has made the platform a trendsetting phenomenon.TikTok did not immediately return a request for comment Tuesday night.The passage of the legislation is a culmination of long-held bipartisan fears in Washington over Chinese threats and the ownership of TikTok, which is used by 170 million Americans. For years, lawmakers and administration officials have expressed concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over U.S. user data, or influence Americans by suppressing or promoting certain content on TikTok.“Congress is not acting to punish ByteDance, TikTok or any other individual company,” Senate Commerce Committee Chairwoman Maria Cantwell said. “Congress is acting to prevent foreign adversaries from conducting espionage, surveillance, maligned operations, harming vulnerable Americans, our servicemen and women, and our U.S. government personnel.”Opponents of the bill say the Chinese government could easily get information on Americans in other ways, including through commercial data brokers that traffic in personal information. The foreign aid package includes a provision that makes it illegal for data brokers to sell or rent “personally identifiable sensitive data” to North Korea, China, Russia, Iran or entities in those countries. But it has encountered some pushback, including from the American Civil Liberties Union, which says the language is written too broadly and could sweep in journalists and others who publish personal information.Many opponents of the TikTok measure argue the best way to protect U.S. consumers is through implementing a comprehensive federal data privacy law that targets all companies regardless of their origin. They also note the U.S. has not provided public evidence that shows TikTok sharing U.S. user information with Chinese authorities, or that Chinese officials have ever tinkered with its algorithm.“Banning TikTok would be an extraordinary step that requires extraordinary justification,” said Becca Branum, a deputy director at the Washington-based Center for Democracy & Technology, which advocates for digital rights. “Extending the divestiture deadline neither justifies the urgency of the threat to the public nor addresses the legislation’s fundamental constitutional flaws.”Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat who voted for the legislation, said he has concerns about TikTok, but he’s also worried the bill could have negative effects on free speech, doesn’t do enough to protect consumer privacy and could potentially be abused by a future administration to violate First Amendment rights.“I plan to watchdog how this legislation is implemented,” Wyden said in a statement.China has previously said it would oppose a forced sale of TikTok, and has signaled its opposition this time around. TikTok, which has long denied it’s a security threat, is also preparing a lawsuit to block the legislation.“At the stage that the bill is signed, we will move to the courts for a legal challenge,” Michael Beckerman, TikTok’s head of public policy for the Americas, wrote in a memo sent to employees on Saturday and obtained by The Associated Press.“This is the beginning, not the end of this long process,” Beckerman wrote.The company has seen some success with court challenges in the past, but it has never sought to prevent federal legislation from going into effect.In November, a federal judge blocked a Montana law that would ban TikTok use across the state after the company and five content creators who use the platform sued. Three years before that, federal courts blocked an executive order issued by then-President Donald Trump to ban TikTok after the company sued on the grounds that the order violated free speech and due process rights.The Trump administration then brokered a deal that had U.S. corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok. But the sale never went through.Trump, who is running for president again this year, now says he opposes the potential ban.Since then, TikTok has been in negotiations about its future with the secretive Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a little-known government agency tasked with investigating corporate deals for national security concerns.On Sunday, Erich Andersen, a top attorney for ByteDance who led talks with the U.S. government for years, told his team that he was stepping down from his role.“As I started to reflect some months ago on the stresses of the last few years and the new generation of challenges that lie ahead, I decided that the time was right to pass the baton to a new leader,” Andersen wrote in an internal memo that was obtained by the AP. He said the decision to step down was entirely his and was decided months ago in a discussion with the company’s senior leaders.Meanwhile, TikTok content creators who rely on the app have been trying to make their voices heard. Earlier Tuesday, some creators congregated in front the Capitol building to speak out against the bill and carry signs that read “I’m 1 of the 170 million Americans on TikTok,” among other things.Tiffany Cianci, a content creator who has more than 140,000 followers on the platform and had encouraged people to show up, said she spent Monday night picking up creators from airports in the D.C. area. Some came from as far as Nevada and California. Others drove overnight from South Carolina or took a bus from upstate New York.Cianci says she believes TikTok is the safest platform for users right now because of Project Texas, TikTok’s $1.5 billion mitigation plan to store U.S. user data on servers owned and maintained by the tech giant Oracle.“If our data is not safe on TikTok,” she said. “I would ask why the president is on TikTok.”Associated Press writers Mary Clare Jalonick and Matt O’Brien contributed to this report.",2024-04-24 05:47:44 AM EEST,NPR,"Senate passes bill forcing TikTok’s parent company to sell or face ban, sends to Biden for signature",https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-congress-bill-1c48466df82f3684bd6eb21e61ebcb8d
Aamer Madhani,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden met Wednesday with Abigail Edan, the 4-year-old American girl who was held hostage in Gaza for several weeks at the start of the war.White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the White House meeting with Abigail and her family was “a reminder of the work still to do” to win the release of dozens of people who were taken captive by Hamas in an Oct. 7 attack on Israel and are still believed to be in captivity in Gaza.Abigail, who has dual Israeli-U.S. citizenship, was taken hostage after her parents were killed in the attack and was released nearly seven weeks later. She was the first U.S. hostage freed by Hamas as part of a deal with Israel to exchange hostages for Palestinian prisoners early in the war. Abigail turned four during her time in captivity.“It was also a reminder in getting to see her that there are still Americans and others being held hostage by Hamas,” said Sullivan, who attended Biden’s meeting with the girl and her family. “And we’re working day in, day out to ensure all of them also are able to get safely home to their loved ones. ”Israel says the militants are still holding around 100 hostages and the remains of more than 30 others.Biden spoke to the girl soon after her release in November. Thursday’s meeting was one of mixed emotions for the president.Sullivan noted that Abigail and her two siblings were “still living with the tragedy and the trauma” of their parents being killed on Oct. 7.“Abigail, of course, is living with the trauma of being held captive for many weeks,” he added. “But this was a moment of joy as well, because she was able to be returned safely to her family. ”Biden’s meeting with Abigail came as Hamas on Wednesday released a recorded video of an Israeli American still being held by the group.The video was the first sign of life of Hersh Goldberg-Polin since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. It was not clear when the video was taken.Goldberg-Polin, 23, was at the Tribe of Nova music festival when Hamas launched its attack from nearby Gaza. In the video, Goldberg-Polin is missing part of his left arm.Witnesses said he lost it when attackers tossed grenades into a shelter where people had taken refuge. He tied a tourniquet around it before being bundled into the truck.Sullivan said U.S. law enforcement officials are assessing the video but declined further comment.",2024-04-25 01:43:12 AM EEST,NPR,"Biden meets 4-year-old Abigail Edan, an American who was held hostage by Hamas",https://apnews.com/article/biden-abigail-edan-hostage-child-release-hamas-a4dd8ec2c1753730695f68dd64c6bc29
"Stephen Groves,Mary Clare Jalonick","WASHINGTON (AP) — For Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Mike Johnson, the necessity of providing Ukraine with weapons and other aid as it fends off Russia’s invasion is rooted in their earliest and most formative political memories.McConnell, 82, tells the story of his father’s letters from Eastern Europe in 1945, at the end of World War II, when the foot soldier observed that the Russians were “going to be a big problem” before the communist takeover to come. Johnson, 30 years younger, came of age as the Cold War was ending.As both men pushed their party this week to support a $95 billion aid package that sends support to Ukraine, as well as Israel, Taiwan and humanitarian missions, they labeled themselves “Reagan Republicans” an described the fight against Russian President Vladimir Putin in terms of U.S. strength and leadership. But the all-out effort to get the legislation through Congress left both of them grappling with an entirely new Republican Party shaped by former President Donald Trump.While McConnell, R-Ky., and Johnson, R-La., took different approaches to handling Trump, the presumptive White House nominee in 2024, the struggle highlighted the fundamental battle within the GOP: Will conservatives continue their march toward Trump’s “America First” doctrine on foreign affairs or will they find the value in standing with America’s allies? And is the GOP still the party of Ronald Reagan?“I think we’re having an internal debate about that,” McConnell said in an interview with The Associated Press. “I’m a Reagan guy and I think today — at least on this episode — we turned the tables on the isolationists.”Still, he acknowledged, “that doesn’t mean they’re going to go away forever.”McConnell, in the twilight of his 18-year tenure as Republican leader, lauded a momentary victory Tuesday as a healthy showing of 31 Republicans voted for the foreign aid; that was nine more than had supported it in February. He said that was a trend in the right direction.McConnell, who has been in the Senate since 1985, said passing the legislation was “one of the most important things I’ve ever dealt with where I had an impact.”But it wasn’t without cost.He said last month he would step away from his job as leader next year after internal clashes over the money for Ukraine and the direction of the party.For Johnson, just six months into his job as speaker, the political crosscurrents are even more difficult. He is clinging to his leadership post as right-wing Republicans threaten to oust him for putting the aid to Ukraine to a vote. While McConnell has embraced American leadership abroad his entire career, Johnson only recently gave complete support to the package.Johnson has been careful not to portray passage as a triumph when a majority of his own House Republicans opposed the bill. He skipped a celebratory news conference afterward, describing it as “not a perfect piece of legislation” in brief remarks.But he also borrowed terms popularized by Reagan, saying aggression from Russia, China and Iran “threatens the free world and it demands American leadership.”“If we turn our backs right now, the consequences could be devastating,” he said.Hard-line conservatives, including some who are threatening a snap vote on his leadership, are irate, saying the aid was vastly out of line with what Republican voters want. They condemned both Johnson and McConnell for supporting it.“House Republican leadership sold out Americans and passed a bill that sends $95 billion to other countries,” said Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, who opposed the bill. He said the legislation “undermines America’s interests abroad and paves our nation’s path to bankruptcy.”Johnson has been lauded by much of Washington for doing what he called “the right thing” at a perilous moment for himself and the world.“He is fundamentally an honorable person,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who brokered the negotiations and spent hours on the phone and in meetings with Johnson, McConnell and the White House.Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said Johnson and McConnell “both showed great resolve and backbone and true leadership at a time it was desperately needed.”When McConnell began negotiations over President Joe Biden’s initial aid request last year, he quickly set the terms for a deal. He and Schumer agreed to pair any aid for Ukraine with help for Israel, Schumer said, and McConnell demanded policy changes at the U.S. border with Mexico.On McConnell’s mind, he said, was that Trump was “unenthusiastic” about providing more aid to Kyiv. Yet McConnell, whose office displays a portrait of every Republican president since Reagan with the exception of Trump, had a virtually nonexistent relationship with the man he often refers to not by name, but simply as “the former president.”Still, Trump would prove to hold powerful sway. When a deal on border security neared completion after months of work, Trump eviscerated the proposal as insufficient and a “gift” to Biden’s reelection. Conservatives, including Johnson, rejected it out of hand.With the border deal dead, McConnell pushed ahead with Schumer on the foreign aid, with the border policies stripped out, solidifying their unusual alliance. The Senate leaders met weekly throughout the negotiation.“We disagreed on a whole lot, but we really stuck together,” Schumer said.“We just persisted. We could not give up on this.”Meanwhile, a small group of GOP senators began working on an idea they thought could give Johnson some political wiggle room. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Kevin Cramer of North Dakota and Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma took an idea that Trump had raised — structuring the aid to Ukraine as a loan — and tried to make it reality.Through a series of phone calls with Trump, several House members, as well as the speaker, they worked to structure roughly $9 billion in economic aid for Ukraine as forgivable loans — just as it was in the final package.“Our approach this time was to make sure that the politics were set, meaning that President Trump is on board,” Mullin said.The conversations culminated in Johnson making a quick jaunt to Florida, where he stood side by side with Trump at his Florida club just days before moving ahead with the Ukraine legislation in the House.It was all enough, with Democratic help, to get the bill across the finish line. The legislation, which Biden signed into law on Wednesday, included some revisions from the Senate bill, including the loan structure and a provision to seize frozen Russian central bank assets to rebuild Ukraine. Nine GOP senators who had opposed the first version of the bill swung to “yes” largely because of the changes Johnson had made.The result was a strong showing for the foreign aid in the Senate, even though the decision could prove costly for Johnson.What comes next on Ukraine is anyone’s guess.While the $61 billion for Ukraine in the package is expected to help the country withstand Moscow’s offensive this year, more assistance will surely be needed. Republicans, exhausted after a grueling fight, largely shrugged off questions about the future.“This one wasn’t easy,” Mullin said.",2024-04-24 21:57:38 PM EEST,NPR,"To pass Ukraine aid, ‘Reagan Republican’ leaders in Congress navigated a party transformed by Trump",https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-aid-congress-republicans-trump-johnson-mcconnell-4cb76cfdefc38f35c1bda2ac8915b179
Wyatte Grantham-Philips,"NEW YORK (AP) — Legislation forcing TikTok’s parent company to sell the video-sharing platform or face a ban in the U.S. received President Joe Biden’s official signoff Wednesday. But the newly minted law could be in for an uphill battle in court.Critics of the sell-or-be-banned ultimatum argue it violates TikTok users’ First Amendment rights. The app’s China-based owner, ByteDance, has already promised to sue, calling the measure unconstitutional.But a court challenge’s success is not is not guaranteed. The law’s opponents, which include advocacy organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union, maintain that the government hasn’t come close to justifying banning TikTok, while others say national-security claims could still prevail.For years, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have expressed concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over U.S. user data, or influence Americans by suppressing or promoting certain content on TikTok. The U.S. has yet to provide public evidence to support those claims, but some legal experts note that political pressures have piled up regardless.If upheld, legal experts also stress that the law could set a precedent carrying wider ramifications for digital media in the U.S.Here’s what you need to know.That’s the central question. TikTok and opponents of the law have argued that a ban would violate First Amendment rights of the social media platform’s 170 million U.S. users.Patrick Toomey, deputy director of the ACLU’s National Security Project, said a TikTok ban would “stifle free expression and restrict public access” to a platform that has become central source for information sharing.Among key questions will be whether the legislation interferes with the overall content of speech on TikTok, notes Elettra Bietti, an assistant professor of law and computer science at Northeastern University, because content-based restrictions meet a higher level of scrutiny.ByteDance had yet to officially file a lawsuit by late Wednesday, but Bietti said she expects the company’s challenge to primarily focus on whether a ban infringes on these wider free-speech rights. Additional litigation involving TikTok’s “commercial actors,” such as businesses and influencers who make their living on the platform, may also arise, she added.TikTok is expressing confidence about the prospects of its planned challenge.“Rest assured, we aren’t going anywhere,” TikTok CEO Shou Chew said in a video response posted to X Wednesday. “The facts and the Constitution are on our side, and we expect to prevail again.”Toomey also said that he is optimistic about the possibility of TikTok being able to block the measure in court, noting that both users and the company “have extremely strong” First Amendment claims.“Many of the calls to completely ban TikTok in the U.S. are about scoring political points and rooted in anti-China sentiment,” Toomey added. “And to date, these steps to ban TikTok had not been remotely supported by concrete public evidence.”Still, the future of any litigation is hard to predict, especially for this kind of case. And from a legal perspective, legal experts say it can be difficult to cite political motivations, even if they’re well-documented, as grounds to invalidate a law.The battle could also string along for some time, with the potential for appeals that could go all the way to the Supreme Court, which would likely uphold the law due to its current composition, said Gus Hurwitz, a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania’s Carey Law School.TikTok’s legal challenge won’t go on without a fight. The government will probably respond with national-security claims, which were already cited prominently as the legislation made its way through Congress.Toomey maintains that the government hasn’t met the high bar required to prove imminent national-security risks, but some other legal experts note that it’s still a strong card to play.“One of the unfortunate and really frustrating things about national-security legislation (is that) it tends to be a trump card,” Hurwitz said. “Once national-security issues come up, they’re going to carry the day either successfully or not.”Hurwitz added that he thinks there are legitimate national-security arguments that could be brought up here. National security can be argued because it’s a federal measure, he added. That sets this scenario apart from previously unsuccessful state-level legislation seeking to ban TikTok, such as in Montana.But national-security arguments are also vulnerable to questioning as to why TikTok is getting specific scrutiny.“Personally, I believe that what TikTok does isn’t that different from other companies that are U.S.-based,” Bietti said, pointing to tech giants ranging from Google to Amazon. “The question is, ‘Why ban TikTok and not the activities and the surveillance carried out by other companies in the United States?’”Still, legal experts note that there could be repercussions beyond TikTok in the future.The measure was passed as part of a larger $95 billion package that provides aid to Ukraine and Israel. The package also includes a provision that makes it illegal for data brokers to sell or rent “personally identifiable sensitive data” to North Korea, China, Russia, Iran or entities in those countries.That has encountered some pushback, including from the ACLU, which says the language is written too broadly and could sweep in journalists and others who publish personal information.“There’s real reason to be concerned that the use of this law will not stop with TikTok,” Toomey said. “Looking at that point and the bigger picture, banning TikTok or forcing its sale would be a devastating blow to the U.S. government’s decades of work promoting an open and secure global internet.”",2024-04-25 07:01:06 AM EEST,NPR,TikTok has promised to sue over the potential US ban.

Isabella Volmert,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Five gubernatorial candidates sought to undermine each other’s records during a final debate Tuesday night ahead of Indiana’s May 7 GOP primary, but took few shots at the absent U.S. Sen. Mike Braun, who is considered the front-runner of the crowded field.Braun, who has former President Donald Trump’s endorsement, skipped the event and instead attended a vote in Washington on a $95 billion foreign aid package for U.S. allies including Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan.On the debate stage, his electoral rivals largely tried to pitch their experience in government as an advantage, not a flaw, and played up popular positions among Republican voters including support for the state’s abortion ban and opposition to federal immigration policies.Whoever wins will be the favorite in November’s general election, as the state reliably elects Republicans. Tuesday’s debate was the last to be televised before the primary vote.Lt. Gov. Suzanne Crouch — a familiar name after running twice alongside current Gov. Eric Holcomb, who is barred by term limits from seeking reelection — defended her sweeping proposal to eliminate the state income tax, saying it will be phased in over time and denying she would raise property taxes.The other candidates called the plan a political gimmick, with former Commerce Secretary Brad Chambers saying, “This is a political talking point if there ever was one.”Crouch ended the most recent fundraising period with $3 million, the most cash on hand of any candidate, but spent only $2.1 million in the first three months of the year. By comparison, Braun has spent over $6 million in 2024.Chambers’ leadership of the the Indiana Economic Development Corporation put him in opponents’ sights several times during the debate. He defended the quasi-governmental organization’s fostering of a controversial technology hub under construction in central Indiana that proposes to pump water across multiple counties.Chambers, who has spent $6.7 million on the campaign this year and contributed $8 million to it, was one of the few to take up the opportunity to criticize Braun in his absence, accusing the senator of inaction on the southern border.Eric Doden, for his part, repeatedly promoted his plan to invest in small towns.“These are the things we’re going to continue to focus on throughout this campaign, not whether a candidate decides to show up or not,” he told reporters after the debate.Doden, also a former commerce secretary, spent $5.2 million in the first three months of this year and last reported having about $250,000 of cash on hand.While the candidates have often attacked Holcomb’s tenure, only a few did so Tuesday. The governor, whose popularity took a hit among conservative voters opposed to restrictions he implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic, has not made an endorsement in the primary.But former Attorney General Curtis Hill attacked Crouch, as Holcomb’s lieutenant governor, over mask mandates, saying she deserves blame for backing them too.Once a rising star in Indiana politics, Hill has struggled to keep up with other contenders’ fundraising. Hill lost the Republican delegation nomination in 2020 following allegations that he groped four women in 2018.Also running is Jamie Reitenour, a political novice who promised Tuesday to appoint the leader of the Hamilton County Moms For Liberty as the state’s secretary of education.Braun voted no on the foreign aid package, which passed overwhelmingly in the Senate. In a statement earlier in the evening, Braun said he wanted policy on immigration to be included in the package.“I was looking forward to sharing my vision with Hoosiers at tonight’s debate but Chuck Schumer has called the Senate into session,” the statement said.His absence at the debate fueled criticism by some opponents that he has put politics first following a missed vote in the Senate to attend a campaign event.",2024-04-24 06:02:06 AM EEST,NPR,Indiana GOP candidates for governor make their pitch to voters at debate in Sen.

"John Raby,Leah Willingham","CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — Don Blankenship hasn’t had much success running for office.He ran for the Senate as a Republican in 2018 and sought the White House in 2020 as a third party candidate. He lost badly both times but is on the ballot again in 2024, this time as a Democrat seeking the Senate seat being vacated by Joe Manchin.Blankenship has plenty of baggage heading into the May 14 Democratic primary. Beyond his history of political losses, he’s perhaps best known in this coal-producing state as the former chief executive of Massey Energy who spent a year in federal prison for conspiring to violate mine safety laws before an explosion at his West Virginia coal mine killed 29 men in 2010.With their threadbare Senate majority on the line in this year’s elections, Democrats are already pessimistic about their chances in West Virginia, where Manchin was the rare member of their party to find success in a state that Republican former President Donald Trump carried by nearly 39 percentage points in 2020. But a Blankenship victory in the primary could prove especially problematic for the party, leaving Democrats with an unpopular candidate with a complicated past in business and politics.The party and its union allies are working to avoid that scenario.Earlier this week, Manchin endorsed Wheeling Mayor Glenn Elliott, who was an aide to legendary Democratic Sen. Robert C. Byrd and is unapologetically pro-union. State Democratic Party Chair Mike Pushkin argues Blankenship isn’t a Democrat and is fond of referring to him as “federal prisoner 12393-088,” a reference to his identification number while incarcerated. And Cecil Roberts, president of the United Mine Workers union — which endorsed Manchin in 2012 and 2018 — said seeing Blankenship file for the Senate as a Democrat “may be the most fraudulent and cynical move” he’s ever seen.“And that’s saying a lot,” Roberts quipped. “If he’s a Democrat, then I’m Batman.”In an interview, Blankenship argued that it’s the Democratic Party that’s inauthentic and that he’s the candidate most aligned with West Virginians.“Basically I hope to deliver the message that when West Virginians vote for a typical Democrat, they’re voting for the policies that they don’t believe in,” he said. “That’s actually the reason they abandoned the party to begin with.”In the Democratic primary, Elliott and Blankenship will face Marine Corps veteran and grassroots organizer Zach Shrewsbury. Jim Justice, the current governor and a wealthy coal operator, and Rep. Alex Mooney, a pro-Trump Republican, are competing for the GOP nomination.In order to win, Blankenship must overcome the toxic atmosphere created by his highly publicized trial. Prosecutors portrayed Blankenship as a micromanager who put profits above safety and made their case using phone calls Blankenship secretly recorded in his Massey office. On those calls, Blankenship said a scathing internal safety memo should be kept confidential and would be a terrible document to show up in legal discovery if a mine fatality occurred.Investigations found that worn and broken cutting equipment created a spark that ignited coal dust and methane gas. Broken and clogged water sprayers allowed what should have been a flare-up to become an inferno. An outspoken critic of then-President Barack Obama, Blankenship, along with his defense team, was ordered by a federal judge during his 2015 trial not to tell jurors he was being persecuted by Democrats.Manchin was governor when the Massey Energy mine Blankenship ran blew up. By the time the ex-CEO was sentenced to a year in prison, Manchin was a U.S. senator.“No sentence is severe enough,” he said on the day Blankenship was sentenced.Blankenship still maintains that natural gas caused the tragedy and blamed Obama’s Mine Health Safety Administration for ventilation changes prior to the explosion. Prosecutors noted that regulators wouldn’t allow the mine’s old ventilation standard because of a 2006 fire that killed two people at another Massey mine in West Virginia.Once one of Appalachia’s wealthiest men, Blankenship has spent thousands on lawsuits alleging he has been the victim of defamation and character assassination, all of which have been rejected by courts — including the U.S. Supreme Court. Before seeking office, Blankenship spent millions backing GOP candidates, including nearly $3.5 million in 2004 to help defeat a Democratic incumbent and elect the first Republican to the state Supreme Court in more than 80 years. His unabashed bankrolling of West Virginia Republicans inspired a John Grisham novel, “The Appeal.”So far, West Virginia voters have given no indication they take him seriously as a candidate.“The Republicans rejected him, so I’m pretty sure the Democrat Party will handily reject him as well,” said Shrewsbury, whose grandfather was a coal miner.Shrewsbury said he has no respect for Blankenship, adding that “he’s not someone who should be in this race.” Shrewsbury and Elliott stress the importance of investing in green energy technology and criticized laws like “Right to Work” passed by the state’s GOP supermajority to weaken union power.“We need to fight for the worker, not the company store,” Shrewsbury said.Manchin also has a tenuous relationship with Justice, the GOP race’s likely frontrunner. Justice, who owns the swanky Greenbrier Hotel and dozens of other businesses, was recruited by Manchin to run as a Democrat for governor before switching parties at a 2017 rally for Trump.Justice’s mining companies have been scrutinized for alleged safety violations and unpaid taxes, and he’s also been sued by retirees of his coal companies over prescription drug coverage interruptions.Elliott said Justice isn’t what West Virginia needs.“He’s protecting coal, that’s what he’s going to say,” Elliott said. “Ask the coal miners who work for him how much he’s protecting the coal miners.”He said struggling people living in dying coal counties want realistic solutions.“Look, there’s room to protect the coal jobs that we have, but also admit that the world is changing and that we have to be investing in ourselves, and not just expecting some outside industry — be it an extractive industry or anything else — to save us.”Mindi Stewart, whose husband Stanley “Goose” Stewart was working at Upper Big Branch and survived on the day of the disaster, said she and her husband don’t like seeing Blankenship being given any platform.Goose was 300 feet (about 91 meters) inside the mine when it blew up. He tried to revive some of his fallen co-workers, then covered their bodies with blankets, their faces obscured by soot.Stewart said they were shocked when Blankenship decided to run as a Democrat. But she said they’re starting to see it differently.“We know he’s going to run every chance he gets and we know why he is running,” she said. “We know, and I think he knows, he’ll never get elected. Being found guilty has eaten him alive from the moment it happened.”",2024-04-24 07:11:49 AM EEST,NPR,Disgraced coal CEO lost races as GOP and third party candidate.

Will Weissert,"WASHINGTON (AP) — When President Joe Biden showed off his putting during a campaign stop at a public golf course in Michigan last month, the moment was captured on TikTok.Forced inside by a rainstorm, he competed with 13-year-old Hurley “HJ” Coleman IV to make putts on a practice mat. The Coleman family posted video of the proceedings on the app — complete with Biden holing out a putt and the teen knocking his own shot home in response, over the caption, “I had to sink the rebuttal.”The network television cameras that normally follow the president were stuck outside.Biden signed legislation Wednesday that could ban TikTok in the U.S. while his campaign has embraced the platform and tried to work with influencers. Already struggling to maintain his previous support from younger voters, the president is now facing criticism from some avid users of the app, which researchers have found is a primary news source for a third of Americans under the age of 30.“There’s a core hypocrisy to the Biden administration supporting the TikTok ban while at the same time using TikTok for his campaign purposes,” said Kahlil Greene, who has more than 650,000 followers and is known on TikTok as the “Gen Z Historian.”“I think it illustrates that he and his people know the power and necessity of TikTok.”The Biden campaign defends its approach and rejects the idea that White House policy is contradicting its political efforts.“We would be silly to write off any place where people are getting information about the president,” said Rob Flaherty, who ran the White House’s Office of Digital Strategy and now is deputy manager of Biden’s reelection campaign.Flaherty said Biden’s team forged relationships with TikTok influencers the 2020 election and that the platform has only gotten more influential since then, “growing as an internet search engine and driving narratives about the president.”The Biden campaign says that an increasingly fragmented modern media environment requires it to meet voters where they are and that TikTok is one of many such places where would-be supporters see its content, in addition to platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.It has produced its own TikTok content, but also relied on everyday users who interact with the president. That includes a post from a family that ate fries and other fixings from the Cook Out fast food chain when Biden recently visited Raleigh, North Carolina, as well as Coleman’s putting video.Opponents of TikTok say its ownership by Chinese company ByteDance gives Beijing a dangerous amount of influence over what narratives Americans see as well as potential access to U.S. user data. Chinese national-security laws allow the ruling Communist Party wide latitude over private business, though the U.S. has not made public evidence that the Chinese government has manipulated the app or forced ByteDance to do its bidding.The law Biden signed Wednesday would force ByteDance to sell the app to a U.S. company within a year or face a national ban. ByteDance has argued the law violates the First Amendment and promised to sue.Former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, now publicly opposes a TikTok ban after issuing an executive order while in office trying to ban the app if ByteDance didn’t sell it.The White House doesn’t have an official TikTok account and Biden banned the app on most government devices in December 2022. Yet the Biden campaign also officially joined TikTok on the night of this year’s Super Bowl, as the president shunned a traditional gameday TV interview to instead spread a political message with the platform.Former White House press secretary Jen Psaki convened a virtual briefing in 2022 for more than two dozen of the app’s influencers to discuss the U.S. approach to Ukraine, a gathering later parodied on “Saturday Night Live.”There have been scores of other such events, including an influencer party at the White House last Christmas and a State of the Union watch party in March. During Biden’s recent, $26 million campaign fundraiser at New York’s Radio City Music Hall with former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, there was an influencer happy hour and an after-party where attendees interacted with Biden.White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the legislation Biden signed “is not a ban. This is about our national security.” She added that the White House isn’t saying “that we do not want Americans to use TikTok.”TikTok has 170 million U.S. users and a study released last November by the Pew Research Center found that about a third of U.S. adults under 30 regularly got news from TikTok, compared to 14% of all adults.Adults under 30 are more likely than U.S. adults overall to oppose a ban on the use of TikTok in the United States, according to an AP-NORC poll conducted in January. Nearly half of 18- to 29-year-olds are opposed, compared to 35% of U.S. adults.About 2 in 10 U.S. adults said then they use TikTok at least once a day, including 44% of 18- to 29-year-olds. Among 18- to 29-year-olds, 7% say they use TikTok “almost constantly” and an additional 28% are using it “several times a day.”Priorities USA, a leading Democratic super PAC, is spending around $1 million this cycle to help fund more than 100 TikTok influencers who produce pro-Biden content ahead of November, and views those efforts as an extension of traditional organizing and communications initiatives.Even if TikTok is eventually banned, most of its influencers are on other platforms that could continue to take their content, especially YouTube and Instagram, said Danielle Butterfield, Priorities USA’s executive director.“TikTok users are online generally and that’s a lot of different places,” said Butterfield, who was also deputy director of digital advertising for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign.Biden, meanwhile, has seen his standing with young people decline. About one-third of adults under 30 approve of how he’s handling his job as president, according to an AP-NORC poll conducted in March — a sharp drop from the roughly two-thirds approved when he first entered office.Greene studied history at Yale, served as the school’s first Black student body president and graduated in 2022. He attended past White House events as an influencer, including a Juneteenth celebration and a West Wing event for the Inflation Reduction Act, a sweeping health care and green energy package, where he met both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.About a year ago, however, Greene says he began posting about Biden’s championing a sweeping 1994 crime law that activists have long said contributed to the mass incarceration of racial minorities. He also criticized Biden’s current administration for what he called “a lack of specific policy made for Black Americans.”Since then, while Greene continues to receive more general emails from the Biden administration, he said says he’s no longer invited to more personal events while some “creators who fell in line, who are less critical” are still going.Flaherty, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, said the campaign has paid influencers in specific instances, like when their content has been used in ads, and that some content creators who work with the campaign have raised concerns about legislation forcing divestment. But he doesn’t see it having a major Election Day impact.“I think young voters aren’t going to vote on TikTok,” Flaherty said. “They are going to vote on issues, which are discussed on TikTok but they’re also discussed other places.”Greene, however, said young voters’ frustration with the Biden administration in other areas — particularly its handling of Israel-Hamas war — have combined with the TikTok divestment legislation to spell political problems for Biden.“There’s no ability for me to overstate how that exacerbates the outcry,” he said, “and the dissatisfaction that people already have.”Associated Press writer Linley Sanders contributed to this report.",2024-04-25 07:02:01 AM EEST,NPR,Biden just signed a bill that could ban TikTok.

Mark Scolforo,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — A form Pennsylvania voters must complete on the outside of mail-in ballot return envelopes has been redesigned, but that did not prevent some voters from failing to complete it accurately for this week’s primary, and some votes will not count as a result, election officials said.The primary was the first use of the revamped form on the back of return envelopes that was unveiled late last year amid litigation over whether ballots are valid when they arrive to be counted inside envelopes that do not contain accurate, handwritten dates.The most recent ruling was a 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel’s decision last month that upheld the date mandate. The groups and individuals who sued to challenge the requirement are currently asking the full 3rd Circuit to reconsider the matter.Pennsylvania Secretary of State Al Schmidt said at an election night news conference that his agency will be following the county-by-county vote tabulation to see how many ballots get thrown out as a result. That will help determine whether the new design did more harm than good.The new design provides blanks for the month and day and has voters complete the last two numbers of the year. The forms prompt voters with a preprinted “20” and requires them to complete the year by adding “24.”“I think we’ve received a lot of positive feedback” about the redesign, Schmidt said, “and I’m confident it will result in fewer voters making unintentional, minor errors that are, however, defective in nature.”The American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, which represents several voter groups in the federal litigation, has said more than 10,000 ballots in the state were disqualified in 2022 based on what opponents of the mandate consider to be a meaningless paperwork error. Older voters are disproportionately more likely to send in ballot envelopes with incorrect or missing dates. Democrats use mail-in voting far more than Republicans in Pennsylvania.Votebeat Pennsylvania reported Monday that a top state election administrator told counties in an email last week they should count ballots “if the date written on the ballot can reasonably be interpreted to be ‘the day upon which (the voter) completed the declaration.’”Lycoming County is not following that advice, and county Elections Director Forrest Lehman said his experience during the primary suggests the changes have not helped get more votes counted.“I’m sure there may be some counties out there that are choosing to count these, but there are also a lot that aren’t,” Lehman said. “And there’s simply no denying that the design of these envelopes has created a new way to record a date that instantly became a huge percentage of all the incorrect dates.”During the 2022 primary, Lycoming County set aside 49 mail ballots. This month, Lycoming set aside 48, among them 22 with incorrect dates. Half of those were invalidated because the voter did not write the last two digits of the year.“Whatever they thought this would accomplish in terms of changing voter behavior, it didn’t change a thing,” he said, except that counties had to buy new envelopes.Berks County set aside 91 mail-in primary ballots for having incorrect return envelope dates, 32 for lacking a date and 129 for not being signed or having someone — typically a spouse — sign another’s ballot. Berks saw nearly 52,000 total votes cast, including more than 16,000 by mail.By the time the outer envelope email from the Department of State arrived last week, Berks County spokesperson Stephanie Nojiri said, officials there had already decided to count those that lack the “24” for the year because the new envelopes were all printed in 2024.Allegheny County had already received nearly 1,400 incorrect ballots when officials there received the new advice from the state on Friday, said spokeswoman Abigail Gardner. The most common problem was a lack of the “24” year.Allegheny election workers had been contacting voters by mailing back their ballots with letters that explained why, and about 800 were corrected. After receiving the Department of State guidance, the county began simply counting those without the “24"" on the date portion of the envelopes.",2024-04-24 23:21:11 PM EEST,NPR,Pennsylvania redesigned its mail-in ballot envelopes amid litigation.

Darlene Superville,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden has granted clemency to 16 people who were convicted of non-violent drug crimes, issuing pardons to 11 men and women and commuting the sentences of five other people in the latest use of his clemency power to address racial disparities in the justice system.Biden said in a statement Wednesday that April is Second Chance Month and that many of the individuals getting clemency had received “disproportionately longer” sentences than they would have under current law.The Democratic president is campaigning for reelection in November and is grappling with how to boost support from communities of color that heavily supported him over Republican Donald Trump in the 2020 election. The two rivals are headed for a likely rematch in November.“Like my other clemency actions, these pardons and commutations reflect my overarching commitment to addressing racial disparities and improving public safety,” Biden said.Biden said those receiving pardons had shown a commitment to bettering their lives and doing good in their communities. He said those who had their sentences commuted, or shortened, had shown they were worthy of forgiveness and the chance to build a future outside of prison.The president issued his most recent pardons in December 2023 to thousands of people who were convicted of the use and simple possession of marijuana on federal lands and in the District of Columbia.An Associated Press analysis of Justice Department data shows that Biden has granted 129 commutations, more than any predecessor in their first term, dating to Richard Nixon. Nixon issued the most pardons at 691.A pardon is an expression of forgiveness by the president, commonly granted to recognize that a person convicted of a crime has accepted responsibility for their actions. A pardon doesn’t mean the person is considered innocent, but does restore some rights, such as voting, that are lost upon conviction. A commutation only reduces a sentence but does not affect a conviction.",2024-04-25 00:56:44 AM EEST,NPR,Biden pardons 11 people and shortens the sentences of 5 others convicted of non-violent drug crimes,https://apnews.com/article/biden-pardons-drug-crime-nonviolent-clemency-54e18f290702f510745178bc5abaf993
Marc Levy,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — When Nikki Haley suspended her presidential campaign, she refused to endorse Donald Trump as the last remaining major candidate for the 2024 Republican nomination — and apparently so did some of her supporters in Pennsylvania.Haley won almost 17% of Pennsylvania’s primary vote Tuesday, or 1 in 6 votes, to Trump’s 83%, despite not campaigning for president since she ended her bid in early March.Pennsylvania’s 19 electoral votes up for grabs in the presidential election make it a premier battleground state. So should those Haley GOP voters refuse to support Trump in November, it could prove a damaging blow to his prospects for victory in the state and, possibly, reelection.Haley’s base was never big enough to seriously challenge Trump before he clinched a third straight Republican presidential nomination, but her supporters have continued to vote for her in primaries in Pennsylvania and elsewhere even after she dropped out.With nearly all ballots counted in Pennsylvania’s primary, the former U.N. ambassador and South Carolina governor tallied more than 157,000 votes, or about twice the 80,500-vote margin by which Democrat Joe Biden beat Trump in Pennsylvania in 2020. Pennsylvania’s election was even closer in 2016, when Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton by 44,000 votes.A larger proportion of votes for Haley tended to come from urban and suburban areas where Trump suffered massive losses in his two previous presidential campaigns.More than a million votes have been counted for Haley in Republican primaries and caucuses since she dropped out, though some of those may have been cast early or by mail before she ended her campaign. During that period, Trump received about 5.8 million votes.Over the same period, more than 600,000 ballots were counted for candidates other than Joe Biden in Democratic primaries and caucuses, while about 4.6 million were for Biden.On the Democratic side in Pennsylvania, U.S. Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota won 7% against Biden, or nearly 70,000 votes as of Wednesday.Counties had reported about 60,000 for write-in candidates in the Democratic primary — an increase from state elections office figures of 28,372 in 2016 and 34,356 in 2020. A handful of counties had not yet reported write-in totals, and the breakdown of write-in votes for “ uncommitted ” was not immediately available.Phillips and Haley qualified for Pennsylvania’s primary ballot before they dropped out of the presidential race, and Biden and Trump are on track to win their parties’ presidential nominations and face each other in November’s general election. Phillips has endorsed Biden.All told, about 1 million ballots have been counted apiece in Tuesday’s GOP and Democratic presidential primaries in Pennsylvania, out of 3.5 million registered Republican voters and 3.9 million registered Democratic voters.Pennsylvania holds closed primary elections, meaning that someone must have been registered as a Republican or a Democrat by April 8 to have voted in the primary for that party.AP Director of Public Opinion Research Emily Swanson contributed to this report.

Matthew Daly,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Coal-fired power plants would be forced to capture smokestack emissions or shut down under a rule issued Thursday by the Environmental Protection Agency.New limits on greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric plants are the Biden administration’s most ambitious effort yet to roll back planet-warming pollution from the power sector, the nation’s second-largest contributor to climate change. The rules are a key part of President Joe Biden’s pledge to eliminate carbon pollution from the electricity sector by 2035 and economy-wide by 2050.The rule was among four separate measures targeting coal and natural gas plants that the EPA said would provide “regular certainty” to the power industry and encourage them to make investments to transition “to a clean energy economy.” They also include requirements to reduce toxic wastewater pollutants from coal-fired plants and to safely manage so-called coal ash in unlined storage ponds.The new rules “reduce pollution from fossil fuel-fired power plants, protect communities from pollution and improve public health — all while supporting the long-term, reliable supply of the electricity needed to power America forward,″ EPA Administrator Michael Regan told reporters at a White House briefing.The plan is likely to be challenged by industry groups and Republican-leaning states. They have repeatedly accused the Democratic administration of overreach on environmental regulations and have warned of a looming reliability crisis for the electric grid. The rules issued Thursday are among at least a half-dozen EPA rules limiting power plant emissions and wastewater pollution.Environmental groups hailed EPA’s latest action as urgently needed to protect against the devastating harms of climate change.The power plant rule marks the first time the federal government has restricted carbon dioxide emissions from existing coal-fired power plants. The rule also would force future electric plants fueled by coal or gas to control up to 90% of their carbon pollution. The new standards will avoid 1.38 billion metric tons of carbon pollution through 2047, equivalent to the annual emissions of 328 million gas cars, the EPA said, and will provide hundreds of billions of dollars in climate and health benefits, measured in fewer premature deaths, asthma cases and lost work or school days.Coal plants that plan to stay open beyond 2039 would have to cut or capture 90% of their carbon dioxide emissions by 2032, the EPA said. Plants that expect to retire by 2039 would face a less stringent standard but still would have to capture some emissions. Coal plants that are set to retire by 2032 would not be subject to the new rules.Rich Nolan, president and CEO of the National Mining Association, said that through the latest rules, “the EPA is systematically dismantling the reliability of the U.S. electric grid.’'He accused Biden, Regan and other officials of “ignoring our energy reality and forcing the closure of well-operating coal plants that repeatedly come to the rescue during times of peak demand. The repercussions of this reckless plan will be felt across the country by all Americans.”Regan denied that the rules were aimed at shutting down the coal sector, but acknowledged in proposing the power plant rule last year that, “We will see some coal retirements.”The proposal relies on technologies to limit carbon pollution that the industry itself has said are viable and available, Regan said. “Multiple power companies have indicated that (carbon capture and storage) is a viable technology for the power sector today, and they are currently pursuing those CCS projects,’' he told reporters Wednesday.Coal provided about 16% of U.S. electricity last year, down from about 45% in 2010. Natural gas provides about 43% of U.S. electricity, with the remainder from nuclear energy and renewables such as wind, solar and hydropower.The power plant rule “completes a historic grand slam” of major actions by the Biden administration to reduce carbon pollution, said David Doniger, a climate and clean energy expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council. The first and most important action was passage of the 2022 climate law, officially known as the Inflation Reduction Act, he said, followed by separate EPA rules targeting tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks and methane emissions from oil and gas drilling.Together, the climate law and the suite of EPA rules “are the biggest reductions in carbon pollution we’ve ever made and will put the country on the pathway to zero out carbon emissions,’' Doniger said in an interview.The nation still faces challenges in eliminating carbon from transportation, heavy industry and more, said Abigail Dillen, president of the environmental group Earthjustice, “but we can’t make progress on any of it without cleaning up the power plants.’'Jim Matheson, CEO of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, called the EPA rule “unlawful, unrealistic and unachievable,” adding that it faced a certain court challenge. The rule disregards the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision that limited the agency’s ability to regulate carbon pollution under the Clean Air Act, Matheson said. It also relies on technologies “that are promising, but not ready for prime time,″ he said.“This barrage of new EPA rules ignores our nation’s ongoing electric reliability challenges and is the wrong approach at a critical time for our nation’s energy future,” said Matheson, whose association represents 900 local electric cooperatives across the country.The EPA rule would not mandate use of equipment to capture and store carbon emissions — a technology that is expensive and still being developed. Instead, the agency would set caps on carbon dioxide pollution that plant operators would have to meet. Some natural gas plants could start blending gas with other fuel sources that do not emit carbon, although specific actions would be left to industry.Still, the regulation is expected to lead to greater use of carbon capture equipment. Only a handful of projects are operating in the country despite years of research.The EPA also tightened rules aimed at reducing wastewater pollution from coal-fired power plants and preventing harm from toxic pits of coal ash, a waste byproduct of burning coal.Coal ash contains cancer-causing substances like arsenic and mercury that can leach into the ground, drinking water and nearby rivers and streams, harming people and killing fish. The waste is commonly stored in ponds near power plants. EPA issued rules in 2015 to regulate active and new ponds at operating facilities, seven years after a disaster in Kingston, Tennessee that flooded two rivers with toxic waste and destroyed property.Environmental groups challenged that rule, arguing it left a large amount of coal ash waste unregulated by the federal government. The rule issued Thursday forces owners to safely close inactive coal ash ponds and clean up contamination.A separate rule will reduce toxic wastewater pollution by 660 million pounds annually, according to federal officials. It’s a reversal of the Trump administration’s push to loosen coal plant wastewater standards.“For the first time, we have seen a comprehensive set of standards that protects the surrounding waterways from the extremely nasty water pollution that comes off these coal-fired sites,” said Frank Holleman, attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center.Associated Press writer Michael Phillis in St. Louis contributed to this story.",2024-04-25 12:08:32 PM EEST,NPR,Tough new EPA rules would force coal-fired power plants to capture emissions or shut down,https://apnews.com/article/power-plants-coal-natural-gas-biden-epa-5c96ca146e7f70b47806beb4bc3713e6
"Will Weissert,Michelle L. Price,Chris Megerian","NEW YORK (AP) — Student protests over the war in Gaza have created a new and unpredictable challenge for President Joe Biden as he resists calls to cut off U.S. support for Israel while trying to hold together the coalition of voters he’ll need for reelection.The protests at Columbia University in New York and other campuses have captured global media attention and resurfaced questions about Biden’s lagging support from young voters. His handling of the Middle East conflict is also being closely watched by both Jewish and Arab American voters in key swing states.At best for Biden, the protests are a passing distraction while the White House presses forward with negotiations over a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas while pushing Israel to limit casualties with more than 34,000 Palestinians dead. At worst, they build momentum toward the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August, potentially triggering scenes of violence that could recall the unrest of protests against the Vietnam War during the party’s convention there in 1968.“If it ends with Columbia, that’s one thing,” said Angus Johnston, a historian focused on campus activism. “If this sends the national student movement to a new place, that’s a very different situation.”Already, Biden’s aides have had to work to minimize disruptions from antiwar protesters, holding smaller campaign events and tightly controlling access. Demonstrators forced his motorcade to change routes to the Capitol on his way to deliver the State of the Union, and they’ve thrown a red substance intended to symbolize blood near his home in Delaware.The president could face more confrontations with students this spring. Morehouse College said Tuesday that Biden would appear at the iconic historically Black campus in May to deliver a commencement address that could draw protests.More than 100 pro-Palestinian demonstrators camped out at Columbia were arrested Thursday, with dozens more people arrested at other campuses. Many now face charges of trespassing or disorderly conduct. The protesters have demanded that their universities condemn Israel’s assault on Gaza after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and divest from companies that do business with Israel.Some people have reported antisemitic chants and messages at and around the Columbia campus, and similar concerns have been reported at other universities. Some Jewish students say they’ve felt unsafe on campus. The White House, in a message Sunday to mark the Passover holiday, denounced what it called an “alarming surge” of antisemitism, saying it “has absolutely no place on college campuses, or anywhere in our country.”Four Jewish Democratic members of Congress toured Columbia’s locked-down campus on Monday with members of the school’s Jewish Law Students Association. They condemned that things had escalated to where Jewish students felt unsafe and the university canceled in-person classes Monday. Columbia said it would use hybrid remote and in-person learning through the end of the spring term.Rep. Kathy Manning of North Carolina called on the Education Department and Justice Department to work with the White House “to ensure that all universities take steps necessary to keep Jewish students and faculty safe.”“This discrimination is simply unacceptable and cannot be allowed to continue,” she said.Biden on Monday sought the same middle ground that he’s staked out for months as he backs Israel’s military operations with weapons shipments while also pushing Israel to limit civilian casualties and get more humanitarian aid into Gaza, where the United Nations has said there is a looming famine.“I condemn the antisemitic protests,” the president said at an Earth Day event. He then added, “I also condemn those who don’t understand what’s going on with the Palestinians.”Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, a high-profile progressive who represents parts of the Bronx and Queens, spoke before Biden at the same event. She said it was “important that we remember the power of young people shaping this country” and praised “the leadership of those peaceful student-led protests.”Former President Donald Trump, Biden’s presumptive Republican opponent in November, pointed to the headlines and images coming out of Columbia to redirect focus from his criminal hush money trial in New York, telling reporters in the courthouse Tuesday that Biden bears the blame for the unrest.“If this were me, you’d be after me. You’d be after me so much,” he said. “But they’re trying to give him a pass. But what’s going on is a disgrace to our country, and it’s all Biden’s fault and everybody knows it.”In a sign of the political potency of the situation at Columbia, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana planned to visit the school Wednesday and meet with Jewish students.Joel Rubin, a former State Department official and Democratic strategist who has worked in Jewish politics for years, rejected critics blaming Biden “for everything that’s gone wrong” but said the president would have to “make the argument for why the policy is the right one and let the chips fall where they may.”“If it were purely politics and polling, it would be a very hard one,” Rubin said. “But I think Biden is making these decisions based on national security.”Biden graduated from Syracuse’s law school in 1968, bypassing the campus convulsions over the Vietnam War. He distanced himself from that protest movement two decades later during his first run for president.“I was married, I was in law school, I wore sports coats,” Biden said in 1987. “You’re looking at a middle-class guy. I am who I am. I’m not big on flak jackets and tie-dyed shirts. You know, that’s not me.″Biden has been endorsed this year by many leading youth activist organizations and built his campaign around key social issues — such as defending abortion rights, combating climate change and canceling student debt for millions — that they believe can energize voters under 30 who are more likely to be concerned about his approach to Gaza.He was in Florida on Tuesday to capitalize on the momentum against nationwide abortion restrictions and criticize a state law soon to go into effect that will ban abortions after six weeks, before many women know they’re pregnant. A day earlier, Vice President Kamala Harris held an event promoting abortion rights in swing state Wisconsin.Safia Southey, a 25-year-old law student at Columbia who is Jewish, has been participating in the protest and sleeping at the encampment on the university’s quad since Thursday. She believes outrage over the war will deflate Biden’s chances against Trump because staunch supporters of Israel are more likely to support the presumptive Republican nominee.“I think Biden has tried to be very strategic and it’s backfired in a lot of ways,” she said.However, Southey said she’ll vote for Biden “pretty much no matter what” in a matchup with Trump.“The students who are upset, especially at these kind of universities, are smart enough to not stay home,” she said. “I think that they’re going to go out and vote, and they’re going to go for the most strategic option, even if they’re not happy for Biden. I think that they would do anything to make sure that Trump’s not in office.”Democratic pollster Cornell Belcher was skeptical that campus demonstrations over Gaza would prove to be politically influential.“What percentage of Americans are really in those narrow spaces, and how representative are they of a broader American audience, or even a broader youth audience?” he asked.Johnston, the historian on student activism, said the current protests don’t approach the size or intensity of demonstrations in the 1960s, when school officials were held hostage and campuses were vandalized.But over the years, he said, “there’s a lot of times where student protests have shaped the national debate.”Weissert and Megerian reported from Washington.

"Jennifer Peltz,Michael R. Sisak,Colleen Long,Jake Offenhartz","NEW YORK (AP) — A reluctant Donald Trump will be back in a New York City courtroom Thursday as his hush money trial resumes at the same time that the U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments in Washington over whether he should be immune from prosecution for actions he took during his time as president.Jurors will hear more witness testimony from a veteran tabloid publisher, and Trump faces a looming decision over whether he violated a gag order imposed by the judge. But he had asked to skip out on his criminal trial for the day so he could sit in on the high court’s special session, where the justices will weigh whether he can be prosecuted over his efforts to reverse his 2020 election loss to President Joe Biden.That request was denied by New York state Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan, who is overseeing the trial on the hush money scheme that was meant to prevent harmful stories about Trump from surfacing in the final days of the 2016 campaign.“Arguing before the Supreme Court is a big deal, and I can certainly appreciate why your client would want to be there, but a trial in New York Supreme Court … is also a big deal,” Merchan told Trump’s lawyer Todd Blanche last week when he nixed the idea.Though 200 miles apart -- and entirely separate cases -- the proceedings Thursday were jumbled together in one big legal and political puzzle that has implications not just for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, but for the American presidency writ large.In both instances, Trump is trying to get himself out of legal jeopardy as he makes another bid for the White House. But the outcome of the Supreme Court case will have lasting implications for future presidents, because the justices will be answering the never-before-asked question of “whether and if so to what extent does a former president enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office.”The high court’s decision may not impact the New York City case, which hinges mostly on Trump’s conduct as a presidential candidate in 2016 — not as a president. He faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with hush money payments meant to stifle embarrassing stories from surfacing. It is the first of four criminal cases against Trump to go before a jury.The New York trial resumes after a scheduled day off with more testimony from the Manhattan District Attorney’s first witness, David Pecker, former publisher of the National Enquirer and a longtime friend of Trump’s who pledged to be his “eyes and ears” during his 2016 presidential campaign.In testimony earlier this week, Pecker explained how he and the tabloid parlayed rumor-mongering into splashy stories that smeared Trump’s opponents and, just as crucially, leveraged his connections to suppress seamy stories about Trump, including a porn actor’s claim of an extramarital sexual encounter years earlier.Pecker traced the origins of their relationship to a 1980s meeting at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and said the friendship bloomed alongside the success of the real estate developer’s TV show “The Apprentice” and the program’s subsequent celebrity version.Pecker recounted how he promised then-candidate Trump that he would help suppress harmful stories and even arranged to purchase the silence of a doorman.“I made the decision to purchase the story because of the potential embarrassment it had to the campaign and to Mr. Trump,” Pecker said of the doorman’s story that his publication later determined wasn’t true.Judge Merchan may also decide whether or not to hold Trump in contempt and fine him for violating a gag order that barred the GOP leader from making public statements about witnesses, jurors and others connected to the case.Some of Trump’s recent online posts in question included one describing prosecution witnesses Michael Cohen, his former attorney, and Stormy Daniels, the porn actress, as “sleaze bags” and another repeating a false claim that liberal activists had tried to infiltrate the jury.Merchan criticized Blanche this week for excusing the posts as Trump simply responding to political attacks and commenting on his experience with the criminal justice system.“When your client is violating the gag order I expect more than one word,” Merchan said.A conviction by the jury in the hush money probe would not preclude Trump from becoming president again, but because it is a state case, he would not be able to pardon himself if found guilty. The charge is punishable by up to four years in prison — though it’s not clear if the judge would seek to put him behind bars.The Supreme Court’s arguments, meanwhile, are related to charges in federal court in Washington, where Trump has been accused of conspiring to overturn the 2020 election. The case stems from Trump’s attempts to have charges against him dismissed. Lower courts have found he cannot claim immunity for actions that, prosecutors say, illegally sought to interfere with the election results.The high court is moving faster than usual in taking up the case, though not as quickly as special counsel Jack Smith wanted, raising questions about whether there will be time to hold a trial before the November election, if the justices agree with lower courts that Trump can be prosecuted.",2024-04-25 07:10:39 AM EEST,NPR,Trump will be in NY for the hush money trial while the Supreme Court hears his immunity case in DC,https://apnews.com/article/trump-hush-money-trial-national-enquirer-1dd3c3111febf219bdf1d8627504a3c5
"Aamer Madhani,Josh Boak","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden has a great economic story to tell voters a decade from now, less so in 2024.On Thursday, the Democratic president will head to upstate New York to celebrate Micron Technology’s plans to build a campus of computer chip factories made possible in part with government support. But the initial phase of the project would open the first plant in 2028 and the second plant in 2029, with more time expected for the next two factories to be completed.Staring down a rematch with Republican Donald Trump, Biden is asking voters to believe in a vision for the U.S. economy that is still largely a promise. This at a moment when voters are most worried about enduring pressures from high inflation, which have led most to rate Biden poorly on the economy.Biden is campaigning on the future, just as Trump, the former president, taps into a past when U.S. manufacturing was the world standard. The Democrat is trying to convince voters to think about how historians will later recall his presidency.“We’re going to look back on this 20 years from now and be talking about what a revolutionary period this was for the country,” Biden told unionized electricians last week. “We’re going to make a real gigantic difference.”It’s a unique message in an era of near-instant gratification. Compared to when Biden began in politics in the 1970s, people can immediately stream music and videos on their smart phones, order a pizza with finger swipe or text a friend thousands of miles away.Trump, for his part, is telling voters that Biden’s policies will hurt jobs tied to making gasoline-powered autos and ultimately send work to China. On Tuesday, he vented about how the rising value of the dollar against foreign currencies would hobble U.S. manufacturing by making American-made goods too costly.“It sounds good to stupid people, but it is a disaster for our manufacturers and others,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “They are actually unable to compete and will be forced to either lose lots of business, or build plants, or whatever, in the ‘smart’ Countries.”The former president at a recent Pennsylvania rally lamented the loss of factory jobs that once made the United States “the greatest country in the history of the world,” saying that the country has since “lost its confidence, willpower and sight.”The Biden administration helped jumpstart the Micron project by agreeing to provide $6.1 billion in government support that will also cover a memory chip factory in Idaho that would be operating in 2026. The money also helps pay for the first two factories in Clay, New York, but not the second pair to be opened later. The funding is part of the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act that, along with the administration’s funding for renewable energy projects, has boosted factory construction spending to record levels.There are also factories planned by Intel in Arizona and Ohio, TSMC in Arizona, Samsung in Texas and other chipmakers. Their efforts will power artificial intelligence and electric vehicles, among other technologies that Biden believes will cement America’s position as the world’s largest economy. Biden has gone to Arizona and Ohio to celebrate chip factories and previously went to New York in 2022 for the Micron project.For decades, voters have heard politicians pledging a manufacturing boom without much to show for it. Factory employment peaked in the late 1970s and has steadily drifted downward because of automation, outsourcing to cheap countries and the closures that come with each recession.In celebrating the Micron project, New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, noted that Trump, while president, famously told voters that electronics maker Foxconn would open a sprawling set of factories in Wisconsin.At the time, Trump took a victory lap, saying that the Taiwan-headquartered company would be bringing manufacturing jobs to the United States.“I will tell you they wouldn’t have done it here, except that I became president, so that’s good,” Trump said in June 2018.That project notoriously flamed out, feeding a sense of cynicism about what the government can do. Microsoft agreed in 2023 to buy the land for a data center after Foxconn failed to deliver on its 13,000 promised jobs.Schumer said an interview that voters will find that this time is different, predicting they will see the United States as pulling ahead of China on the technologies that are essential for national security and economic growth, allowing more jobs and needed technology to stay in America.“We want to be proud of our economy and there was too much of a feeling that we were losing out to China and other countries,” Schumer said.",2024-04-25 12:06:02 PM EEST,NPR,"As Biden celebrates computer chip factories, voters wait for the promised production to start",https://apnews.com/article/biden-tech-chips-economy-jobs-micron-trump-e45216eddbd697ad5ead14879a769f7a
Mark Sherman,"WASHINGTON (AP) — On the left and right, Supreme Court justices seem to agree on a basic truth about the American system of government: No one is above the law, not even the president.“The law applies equally to all persons, including a person who happens for a period of time to occupy the Presidency,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote in 2020.Less than a year earlier, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, then a federal trial judge, wrote, “Stated simply, the primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that Presidents are not kings.”But former President Donald Trump and his legal team are putting that foundational belief to the test on Thursday when the high court takes up Trump’s bid to avoid prosecution over his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to President Joe Biden.Trump’s lawyers argue that former presidents are entitled to absolute immunity for their official acts. Otherwise, they say, politically motivated prosecutions of former occupants of the Oval Office would become routine and presidents couldn’t function as the commander-in-chief if they had to worry about criminal charges.Lower courts so far have rejected those arguments, including a unanimous three-judge panel on an appeals court in Washington, D.C. And even if the high court resoundingly follows suit, the timing of its decision may be as important as the outcome. That’s because Trump has been pushing to delay the trial until after the November election, and the later the justices issue their decision, the more likely he is to succeed.The court typically issues its last opinions by the end of June, which is roughly four months before the election.The election interference conspiracy case brought by special counsel Jack Smith in Washington is just one of four criminal cases confronting Trump, the first former president to face prosecution. He already is standing trial in New York on charges that he falsified business records to keep damaging information from voters when he directed payments to a former porn star to keep quiet her claims that they had a sexual encounter.Smith’s team says the men who wrote Constitution never intended for presidents to be above the law and that, in any event, the acts Trump is charged with — including participating in a scheme to enlist fake electors in battleground states won by Biden — aren’t in any way part of a president’s official duties.Nearly four years ago, all nine justices rejected Trump’s claim of absolute immunity from a district attorney’s subpoena for his financial records. That case played out during Trump’s presidency and involved a criminal investigation, but no charges.Justice Clarence Thomas, who would have prevented the enforcement of the subpoena because of Trump’s responsibilities as president, still rejected Trump’s claim of absolute immunity and pointed to the text of the Constitution and how it was understood by the people who ratified it.“The text of the Constitution … does not afford the President absolute immunity,” Thomas wrote in 2020.The lack of apparent support on the court for the sort of blanket immunity Trump seeks has caused commentators to speculate about why the court has taken up the case in the first place.Phillip Bobbitt, a constitutional scholar at Columbia University’s law school, said he worries about the delay, but sees value in a decision that amounts to “a definitive expression by the Supreme Court that we are a government of laws and not of men.”The court also may be more concerned with how its decision could affect future presidencies, Harvard law school professor Jack Goldsmith wrote on the Lawfare blog.But Kermit Roosevelt, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said the court never should have taken the case because an ideologically diverse panel of the federal appeals court in Washington adequately addressed the issues.“If it was going to take the case, it should have proceeded faster, because now, it will most likely prevent the trial from being completed before the election. Even Richard Nixon said that the American people deserve to know whether their president is a crook. The Supreme Court seems to disagree,” Roosevelt said.The court has several options for deciding the case. The justices could reject Trump’s arguments and unfreeze the case so that U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan can resume trial preparations, which she has indicated may last up to three months.The court could end Smith’s prosecution by declaring for the first time that former presidents may not be prosecuted for official acts they took while in office.It also might spell out when former presidents are shielded for prosecution and either declare that Trump’s alleged conduct easily crossed the line or return the case to Chutkan so that she can decide whether Trump should have to stand trial.",2024-04-25 07:05:48 AM EEST,NPR,No one is above the law.
