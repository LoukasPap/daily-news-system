Alli Rosenbloom,"Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell really didn’t mind those pesky dating rumors that circulated when they were promoting their 2023 rom-com “Anyone But You.”In fact, they were very much involved in amplifying the buzz, according to Sweeney – who also served as an executive producer on the movie – saying she was on “every call” with studio execs about the marketing plan.“I wanted to make sure that we were actively having a conversation with the audience as we were promoting this film,” she told the New York Times in an interview published on Wednesday. “Because at the end of the day, they’re the ones who created the entire narrative.”Sweeney and “Top Gun: Maverick” star Powell put their chemistry on full display during a flirty appearance at last year’s CinemaCon, which spawned speculation on social media that there was a potential real-life romantic connection.Powell had split with his then-girlfriend at the time, according to the Times, and Sweeney has been engaged to businessman Jonathan Davino since 2022 – which all nonetheless fueled the rumor mill.“Sydney and I have a ton of fun together, and we have a ton of effortless chemistry,” Powell told the Times. “Sometimes you just have to lean into it a bit — and it worked wonderfully. Sydney is very smart.”The “Euphoria” actress did eventually set the record straight when she hosted “Saturday Night Live” in March, saying during her monologue that “the craziest rumor I’ve seen is that while I was filming ‘Anyone But You,’ I was having an affair with my co-star Glen Powell.”“That is obviously not true,” she said, later adding that she and Davino are “still together and stronger than ever.”“Anyone But You” was released in theaters in December and follows a hot-and-cold couple played by Sweeney and Powell who are thrust into pretending to be a happy couple at a destination wedding in Australia. It is now available to stream on Netflix.",2024-04-24 23:47:00 PM EEST,CNN,Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell explain why they actually leaned in to all those dating rumors,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/24/entertainment/sydney-sweeney-glen-powell-dating-rumors/index.html
"Review by,Brian Lowry","The 1980 miniseries “Shōgun” is rightly considered a landmark of its time, both creatively and commercially. Yet the recent FX/Hulu retelling of James Clavell’s epic novel set in feudal Japan brought the story into the 21st century with a production that improved on it in fundamental ways, while reflecting how the TV landscape has changed over that time.Although the bones of the new 10-part limited series remained the same, the perspective shifted in part away from the English character, John Blackthorne (Cosmo Jarvis), and toward Lord Toranaga (Hiroyuki Sanada) and Lady Mariko (Anna Sawai), evidence of a more global TV environment. That included a heavily subtitled production for a US audience whose resistance to them is reduced now (see the success of programs like “Squid Game”) from what it was back then.Indeed, NBC’s concerns about that in 1980, and whether Americans would embrace a project featuring predominantly Japanese characters, could be seen in the extent to which the story centered on Blackthorne. The result, of course, helped burnish Richard Chamberlain’s claim to the title “king of the miniseries,” but it resulted in somewhat underplaying the role of Toshiro Mifune as Toranaga, and the use of narration by Orson Welles.The new version also significantly expanded and enhanced the female roles, in subtle and not-so-subtle ways, peaking with Mariko’s acts of heroism and sacrifice in the penultimate episode. While that makes sense, the skill with which the producers engineered it feels like no small feat given the male-dominated structure of feudal Japanese society and the military underpinnings of the plot.“Shōgun” further benefited, then and now, from being a true limited series (the term “miniseries” having fallen out of use), telling a self-contained story with a beginning, middle and end. Thanks to its combination of critical acclaim and popularity (albeit on a much lesser scale than what was possible in the days of three broadcast networks), there’s already speculation about ways to extend that, but the idea of crafting some sort a prequel or sequel seems misguided and, given the resolution of Toranaga’s meticulous plotting, unnecessary.Hollywood’s appetite for remaking past artifacts has been one of the constants of the industry, as we head into a summer movie-going season that kicks off with “The Fall Guy,” adapted from a TV show that premiered the year after “Shōgun” did.From that perspective, “Shōgun’s” finale cemented its status as a model and beacon for that practice, setting the kind of high bar for remakes that will be difficult to dethrone.",2024-04-24 18:56:00 PM EEST,CNN,How ‘Shōgun’ brought the feudal epic into the 21st century,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/24/entertainment/shogun-finale-review/index.html

She spoke fondly of her former student, with whom she stayed in touch for a time over email.“I feel like maybe I gave her a little spark or encouragement to do what she was doing,” Kolvek told the outlet.“I would say how proud I was of her and that she has never lost her focus and she’s never lost the real person that she is,” Kolvek added. “She’s always been very honest and open, and I admire that in her.”Heather Brown is a former third grade teacher who had Swift in her first class.She told CBS, “Every student has a special quality.”“And you always remember every student from the quality they have,” she said. “Taylor’s quality was just being she was one of those students where people just drew to.”",2024-04-24 20:21:00 PM EEST,CNN,Taylor Swift’s elementary school teachers remember her as a young star,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/24/entertainment/taylor-swift-young-poet/index.html
"Kevin Liptak,Kayla Tausche","President Joe Biden might not be saying much about his Republican challenger’s criminal trial, but as Donald Trump sits in a Manhattan courtroom — irritated, seemingly tired and, by his own declaration, freezing cold — the president is still finding plenty to say about his rival.The Trump Bibles he’s selling? “I almost wanted to buy one just to see what the hell is in it,” he said this week in Florida.Drooping stock prices for Trump’s Truth Social? “He might do better under my tax plan than his,” Biden deadpanned in Pennsylvania.Trump’s Covid-era musing on injecting bleach? “He missed. It all went to his hair,” he told a crowd of builders in Washington.Sure, there are ample punchlines for a trial that contains, at its center, a hush money payment to an adult film star. Biden has been studiously avoiding those and doesn’t plan on changing that approach anytime soon.Instead, as he goes about a robust schedule of policy speeches and campaign events, Biden is finding other ways to needle Trump, all with an eye toward getting under his predecessor’s skin without crossing a self-drawn line on providing ongoing trial commentary.Campaign officials are fully aware the Trump trial could dominate news coverage in the weeks to come. Biden has sought his moments to break through, including a high-profile endorsement from the Kennedy family and a foray into Florida for a speech on abortion rights.Thursday will find Biden in Syracuse, New York, touting a new $6 billion investment in Micron made possible by the CHIPS and Science Act — exactly the kind of policy-minded accomplishment Biden has spent the last year promoting.Some Biden allies grumble that trying to compete for attention with the first-ever criminal trial of a former US president will be a challenge for the incumbent, who is already suffering from an enthusiasm deficit among Democrats and battling a lack of knowledge about his first term accomplishments.Ultimately, however, many on Biden’s team believe the two men’s schedules will handily advance the contrast that’s been on display for voters this election.Even some occasional critics of Biden’s campaign strategy have not found fault in his approach to the Trump trial.“I don’t think he should be involving himself in the details of” Trump’s trial, said David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama and a CNN senior political commentator.“But it is an opportunity for him to go out and talk about the future and talk about the contrast on substantive issues. And I think ultimately a message that works for him is, I’m focused on your future. He’s focused on his past and this is very much being reflected in what’s going on right now,” Axelrod told CNN’s Dana Bash on “Inside Politics.”<h2>Walking a fine line</h2>The former president’s trial has not been entirely absent from Biden’s day-to-day. On Wednesday, as Biden was preparing to receive an endorsement from North America’s Building Trades Unions, the crowd broke into chants of “Lock him up” when an image of Trump flashed in a video.In multiple pun-filled statements over recent days, Biden’s campaign has used the trial to provide a stark contrast between the president and his Republican rival, contrasting, for example, Biden’s Pennsylvania blitz last week with Trump’s (or as they call him, “Sleepy Don”) activities.“The verdict is in, Donald Trump and his campaign’s self-inflicted wounds are not paying off. Their strategy of not campaigning, wasting money, acting like small time thugs, and pushing their extreme agenda is driving away voters,” Biden campaign spokesperson James Singer said in a statement Friday.And, as his comments about Trump’s business, Bibles and hair suggest, it’s not as if Biden is wary of getting personal.Still, weighing in directly on Trump’s legal issues has been deemed a risky proposition, one that could lend pretext to the former president’s false claims that Biden is behind his multiple indictments and criminal cases.And anyway, some Biden advisers argue, November’s election will likely be decided on issues like the economy and abortion, not the complex legal predicament of the Republican nominee.<h2>On the trail during the trial</h2>It is that viewpoint that has largely animated the president’s schedule as Trump’s first criminal trial gets underway. During the first two weeks of the proceedings, Biden will have traveled to four states touting his policies on clean energy, reproductive rights and manufacturing.Biden advisers – both at the campaign and the White House – say that robust schedule will continue over the course of the coming weeks, with Trump’s trial expected to continue in a lower Manhattan courtroom through mid-June.On Tuesday, Biden headed to Tampa, Florida – Trump’s figurative backyard – to hammer Republicans on abortion. The trip followed swings through battleground Pennsylvania during the court’s jury selection and Virginia on the first day of Trump’s trial.A campaign official described the strategy as staying a course that Biden has been on for months now: pounding the pavement while his rival seethes on social media.“We don’t have to do anything out of the ordinary,” a campaign official told CNN, comparing the differences in the candidates’ schedules in the month of March, before the trial began. “That implicit contrast is already there.”While the White House has preferred to let the visual “split-screen,” in aides’ parlance, speak for itself, the campaign has been sending out sharply worded missives, needling Trump for being off the campaign trail and lagging his 2020 fundraising benchmarks.Behind the scenes, campaign staff are using the weekslong trial to recalibrate, plan, and strategize for the spring to November, one official said. And White House and campaign officials say there’s no formalized approach to distill the trial developments into strategy – no war room, no daily memos, no staffers tasked with keeping brass at 1600 Pennsylvania and campaign headquarters apprised of each day’s happenings.Instead, they’re following along like the rest of the American public: by watching the coverage unfold on television.",2024-04-25 12:00:00 PM EEST,CNN,Biden keeps needling Trump as he walks a tightrope over his rival’s trial,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/25/politics/biden-campaign-trail-trump-criminal-trial/index.html
"Arit John,Natasha Chen,Jason Kravarik,Shania Shelton","The Arizona House of Representatives voted Wednesday to overturn the state’s 160-year-old abortion ban, setting the stage for a repeal that would leave the state’s 15-week restriction on the procedure in place.The vote comes after two failed attempts by lawmakers in the Republican-controlled state House to bring the bill to the floor last week, as Democrats sought to strike down the ban after the state Supreme Court revived it earlier this month.Three Republicans voted with all 29 Democrats Wednesday to advance the legislation. The state Senate is expected to pass the repeal measure in early May. And Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs is expected to sign the bill if lawmakers advance it to her desk.“This has been a long time coming,” said Athena Salman, the executive director of Arizona campaigns for Reproductive Freedom for All, formerly NARAL Pro-Choice America.In its April 9 ruling, the Arizona Supreme Court said that the state must adhere to the 1864 law that bars all abortions except in cases when “necessary” to save a pregnant woman’s life. The law also carries a prison sentence of two to five years for abortion providers.Wednesday’s vote is a boon to reproductive rights advocates and some Republican candidates, including former President Donald Trump, who have tried to distance themselves from the court ruling.Within the Arizona House, however, the repeal measure drew angry remarks from several Republicans.“I am disgusted today,” state Rep. Rachel Jones said. “Life is one of the tenants of our Republican platform. To see people go back on that value is egregious to me.”Arizona House Speaker Ben Toma, who said he opposes all abortions except to save a pregnant woman’s life, said lawmakers had rushed into repealing the ban.State Rep. Matt Gress, one of the Republicans who voted with Democrats, said the ban – which was first introduced when Arizona was still a US territory – didn’t reflect the values of most Arizona voters. Repealing it should have been a simple proposition, he said.“I think it was more difficult than it needed to be,” Gress told CNN.As the session ended, state House leadership removed Gress from the chamber’s Appropriations Committee, a move that was seen as punishment for bucking the party. Gress said it was “unfortunate and potentially unprecedented,” but he didn’t regret his vote.“I campaigned against the territorial ban and made it very clear to my voters that I don’t support it,” said Gress, who represents a Phoenix-area district.﻿Hobbs told CNN’s Abby Phillip Wednesday night she was “relieved” by the repeal’s passage in the state House.“There have been untold levels of chaos and fear across the state since this Supreme Court decision. So now the Senate needs to vote to send this repeal to my desk, so we can get rid of this 1864 ban once and for all,” the Democratic governor said on “NewsNight.”If a repeal vote fails in the state Senate, the 1864 law could take effect as early as June 8, making Arizona one of more than a dozen states that bans abortion at virtually all stages of pregnancy with few exceptions.If it succeeds, Arizona’s 15-week restriction on abortions will continue to be state law. However, officials warned that the territorial ban could be briefly enforceable because nonemergency bills passed in Arizona don’t take effect until 90 days after the Legislature adjourns.In neighboring California, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom praised a state bill that would allow Arizona medical professionals to perform abortions for Arizona patients in California through the end of the year, arguing that it could help Arizonans even if the 1864 ban is repealed.“With its urgency clause, SB 233 would fill a critical gap for care during a meaningful period of time before an Arizona repeal could be implemented,” a news release from the governor’s office said. “Swift action helps combat the confusion and chilling effect this back-and-forth creates.”The Civil War-era abortion ban, which dates to before statehood, was codified in 1901. It remained in effect until 1973, when it was blocked by a court injunction after Roe v. Wade created a federal constitutional right to an abortion.In March 2022, months before the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Republican Gov. Doug Ducey signed into law the state’s 15-week ban, which has no exceptions for rape or incest. That legislation stated explicitly that it did not overrule the 1864 law.Democrats have made clear that they still plan to emphasize abortion policy heading into the general election. Arizona Republicans hold one-seat majorities in the state House and Senate, and the state will be a US Senate and presidential battleground this fall.Sam Paisley, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats to statehouse seats, called Wednesday’s vote a “clear victory for Arizona House Democrats” but pointed out that the 15-week restriction would still exist after a repeal.“The only way to protect reproductive freedoms is to elect Democrats to the legislature to repeal this (15-week) ban too,” Paisley said in a statement.Abortion rights advocates are currently working to place a constitutional amendment proposal on the state’s November ballot that would protect abortion access up to fetal viability, which doctors believe is around 22 to 24 weeks of pregnancy. Arizona for Abortion Access, the group backing the amendment, has gathered more than 500,000 signatures. Advocates must submit 384,000 valid signatures by July 3 to make the general election ballot.Prior to the Arizona House vote, the chamber’s rules committee voted along party lines to approve the late introduction of three House resolutions, largely believed to be Republican-backed ballot measures designed to compete with the abortion rights amendment.This story has been updated with additional information.CNN’s Taylor Romine contributed to this report.",2024-04-25 07:10:00 AM EEST,CNN,"Arizona House votes to overturn 1864 abortion ban, paving way to leave 15-week limit in place",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/24/politics/arizona-house-abortion-law/index.html
Jacqueline Howard,"The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an advisory Tuesday about the risks of counterfeit or mishandled Botox injections after dangerous fake versions of the product have been found in several states.The CDC, the US Food and Drug Administration and state and local officials are working to investigate clusters of at least 22 women who have reported harmful reactions after receiving counterfeit Botox injections, injections from unlicensed or untrained providers or shots in places that were not health-care settings, such as spas or private homes, according to the official CDC health advisory.As of Thursday, those incidents have been reported in California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York City, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. Among the people who reported symptoms, 11 were hospitalized, the CDC said, but none have died.The patients, ages 25 to 59, reported their symptoms between November and March, and most of them – 91% – reported receiving Botox for cosmetic purposes, according to the CDC. Their symptoms included blurred vision, drooping eyelids, dry mouth, slurred speech, shortness of breath, fatigue and weakness. Seven of them were tested for botulism. Test results were negative for six, while one is still pending.These incidents appear to be connected to products that have been purchased from unlicensed sources and then administered by either unlicensed or licensed providers, according to a previous FDA announcement. The agency warned health-care professionals that purchasing and administering counterfeit products puts patients’ health at risk.The counterfeit Botox products may be identified by the lot number C3709C3 on the outer carton and vial, according to the FDA.The outer carton also may display the active ingredient as “Botulinum Toxin Type A” instead of “OnabotulinumtoxinA.” The carton and vial may indicate 150-unit doses, which is not a dosage made by the companies AbbVie or Allergan, the FDA said, and the outer carton may contain language that is not English.In Tuesday’s advisory, the CDC noted that when botulinum toxin, known as Botox, diffuses around the site where it was injected, it can result in adverse effects.“Botulism is the disease caused by botulinum toxin circulating in the blood and producing effects remotely from the injection site. There may be symptom overlap between the presentation of localized adverse effects from injection of botulinum toxin, especially in the head and neck, and the early symptoms of botulism,” according to the advisory.“Clinicians and health departments should consider the possibility of adverse effects from botulinum toxin injections in patients presenting with localized paralysis,” the advisory says. “Clinicians should immediately contact their state, tribal, local, or territorial health department if they suspect botulism.”Botulism can be treated with an antitoxin, according to the CDC. That’s why it’s important to get medical care quickly and early in the course of the disease. If the disease is left untreated, it may progress to paralysis and other complications.“Botulinum toxin should be administered only by licensed providers, using only recommended doses of FDA-approved botulinum toxin, preferably in a licensed or accredited healthcare setting,” the CDC advisory says. “Providers should be trained in the proper administration of botulinum toxin, practicing in accordance with state and local requirements.”In response to the reports of counterfeit Botox, the companies behind the FDA-approved versions, AbbVie and Allergan Aesthetics, said in a statement that they are the only authorized suppliers of Botox in the United States.“Allergan Aesthetics, an AbbVie company, has a comprehensive supply chain security program to ensure that all products manufactured are safe, secure, and sold through authorized distribution channels. All reports of counterfeit product are thoroughly investigated by our team and in conjunction with law enforcement and public health authorities where appropriate,” the statement says.Providers and consumers can identify authentic Botox products by a tamper-evident seal on the packaging, the name “onabotulinumtoxinA” listed under the brand name Botox and a hologram of the word “Allergan” on the vial label.Botox is a brand name for botulinum toxin, which in small doses can temporarily treat medical or cosmetic concerns such as severe underarm sweating, chronic migraines, overactive bladder and facial wrinkles.“Botox and its peer brands provide a dilute, precise, and consistent amount of botulinum toxin, whereas knock-off unregulated products are not reliably manufactured or subject to the same quality assurance, which can lead to over or underdosing,” Dr. Michael Cameron, president and founder of Cameron Dermatology and assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Mount Sinai Health System in New York, said last week.When in the body at high levels, the toxin botulinum can cause the rare but serious illness botulism or symptoms similar to those from the illness.“Signs and symptoms of botulism include muscle weakness, vision changes, slurred speech, difficulty moving your eyes. An emergency would be if you start to have difficulty breathing,” Cameron said.“I personally recommend if you’re getting Botox for your wrinkles, you go to a board-certified dermatologist. If you’re getting Botox for your migraines, you go to a neurologist. If you’re getting Botox for your bladder issues, you go to your urologist,” he said. “If you feel like there’s any risk or the pricing doesn’t really make sense, then you could just ask to actually see the vial and inspect the vial of Botox yourself.”",2024-04-23 22:24:00 PM EEST,CNN,CDC issues health advisory about risks of counterfeit or mishandled Botox injections,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/23/health/cdc-health-advisory-botox-injections/index.html
Brian Fung,"The clock has begun ticking for TikTok to find a new owner.President Joe Biden signed legislation Wednesday that would ban TikTok in the United States unless its Chinese parent, ByteDance, sells the app. TikTok plans to challenge the law in court, but if it fails, the company would have to find a buyer, and fast.That raises the question of who the US government might view as a suitable new owner of a social media platform with 170 million US users and a rising challenger to legacy social media giants such as Facebook-parent Meta.The prospect of a TikTok sale could lead to a potential feeding frenzy, drawing out everyone from tech companies to retailers and private equity firms and investment bankers.And an added headache for any potential buyer: China’s commerce ministry has previously said it would “firmly oppose” any forced sale of TikTok.There’s no apparent consensus on a favorite bidder yet. But some candidates seem more likely than others, legal experts and business analysts say.<h2>Don’t expect a Meta or Google to swoop in</h2>Any effort by an established tech giant with a large social media presence would immediately trigger antitrust red flags, according to analysts.Meta is already fighting a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit that alleges its purchase of WhatsApp and Instagram violated US antitrust law, and the FTC is actively seeking to break up the company.Google is also fighting Justice Department antitrust suits on two fronts. These are related to its search and advertising technology businesses, not its ownership of YouTube. Still, the company is under such close scrutiny that it would be a poor candidate to buy TikTok, experts say.“If it’s Amazon, Microsoft, Google or Meta, I just think you’re going to see substantial antitrust concern,” said Gene Kimmelman, a former Justice Department antitrust official. “If you were to say, like, an Intel, or a Cisco, maybe Oracle, I don’t know. If you were to tell me it’s Verizon, or AT&T, maybe it’s not as big of a problem.”Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at Emarketer, highlighted a paradox: Only the largest, most dominant tech giants may have the resources to buy TikTok. But it may be they who would attract the most regulatory skepticism.“Any potential buyer must have deep pockets and a strong stomach,” Enberg said. “While many would want to get their hands on TikTok’s coveted algorithm, most of those who could afford to buy the app wouldn’t be able to clear antitrust hurdles.”<h2>Past suitors may get another opportunity</h2>Microsoft recently attracted heaps of antitrust scrutiny when it sought to buy the video game publisher Activision Blizzard in one of the largest tech mergers in history. But it ultimately overcame an FTC lawsuit and placated other international regulators to close the blockbuster deal last fall.Fresh off that success, Microsoft could find itself with a renewed opportunity to strike a deal with TikTok. While Microsoft owns LinkedIn, a social network geared to professionals, it doesn’t have an app like TikTok in its portfolio.Microsoft had been one of the handful of contenders to buy TikTok in 2020 when President Donald Trump first pushed for a sale. The negotiations had also involved Walmart, which said at the time it was partnering with Microsoft on a possible deal.Both companies dropped their efforts after TikTok agreed to work with Oracle on Project Texas, the initiative by TikTok to store US user data on Oracle-owned servers and that was intended to satisfy US national security concerns.Four years later, with TikTok’s future in doubt, so is the fate of Project Texas, and that means those who had previously expressed interest in TikTok may have another shot. And Oracle, too.<h2>A former Trump Cabinet official enters the fray</h2>In a move that caught many by surprise, former Trump Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced last month that he is putting together a team of investors to buy TikTok.The exact details of Mnuchin’s offer are hazy, though he has reportedly suggested a deal could exclude TikTok’s powerful content algorithm that has formed the basis of its popularity. That might get around Chinese government export restrictions on recommendation algorithms, but would essentially mean buying only TikTok’s brand and leaving its most treasured asset off the table.The unusual pitch has already raised eyebrows: Mnuchin helped lead the Trump administration’s effort to ban TikTok the first time around. Mnuchin has said publicly that that experience gave him a deep understanding of TikTok and how it operates, including the data it collects on users.That Mnuchin may now leverage that inside knowledge for his own potential benefit reflects a conflict of interest, some critics say.It would be a “disgrace if [Mnuchin] was allowed to turn around and use that classified information to further enrich himself and his Saudi buddies,” Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden told The Washington Post last month.Buying TikTok would also turn Mnuchin into a rival to Trump, who is the chairman and leading shareholder of the company that owns Truth Social, a social media platform where Trump is its most popular user.Other businessmen who’ve expressed interest include Kevin O’Leary, the Canadian chairman of the private venture capital firm O’Leary Ventures. As with Mnuchin, O’Leary has said a potential acquisition of TikTok may have to exclude TikTok’s algorithm. His suggested opening bid? Between $20 billion and $30 billion.",2024-04-25 14:00:00 PM EEST,CNN,Who could buy TikTok?,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/25/tech/who-could-buy-tiktok/index.html
Hanna Ziady,"Shares in Meta plunged in premarket trading Thursday as the Facebook owner’s plans to “invest aggressively” in artificial intelligence spooked investors.The stock was down around 13%, threatening to wipe almost $163 billion off its market value, as investors looked beyond bumper first-quarter earnings to focus on the huge costs to the company of building an AI future.The company is competing head-to-head with Microsoft and Google to unlock the enormous potential of AI. While the payoffs could be huge, Meta’s most recent earnings underscored that building the best tools is costly and will take time.Meta (META), which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram, said Wednesday that first-quarter profit more than doubled year-on-year, while revenue was up 27%. But an increase of as much as $5 billion in projected AI investments — and the likelihood of further increases in subsequent years — made shareholders uneasy.“The language around spending plans has become bolder once more, and this could be what’s spooking markets,” Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, wrote in a note Thursday.“For all Meta’s bold AI plans, it can’t afford to take its eye off the nucleus of the business — its core advertising activities… Meta’s resources are vast but not infinite, and its digital advertising market share needs defending at all costs,” she added.Meta said full-year capital expenditure would be in the range of $35-40 billion — up from previous guidance of $30-37 billion — as it continues to accelerate infrastructure investments to support AI.“We expect capital expenditures will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts,” the company added in a statement.On a call with investors, CEO Mark Zuckerberg focused most of his comments on AI. He said Meta wants to be “the leading AI company in the world” and “should invest significantly more over the coming years to build even more advanced models.”Meta would increase spending “meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these new products… On the upside, once our new AI services reach scale, we have a strong track record of monetizing them effectively,” he added.Weaker than expected guidance for the current quarter may also be weighing on the stock. Meta has forecast revenue of $36.5-39 billion, versus analyst expectations of $38.2 billion.“A slightly lower revenue forecast than anticipated contributed to investor concerns about the company’s future performance,” said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management.",2024-04-25 13:00:00 PM EEST,CNN,Meta’s stock plunges on ‘aggressive’ AI spending plans,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/25/investing/meta-stock-plunges-ai-spending/index.html
Jill Martin,"Reggie Bush is getting his 2005 Heisman Memorial Trophy back after having had to relinquish the award in 2010.In a press release Wednesday on Heisman.com, the decision by the Heisman Trust to reinstate Bush followed a deliberative process in which it closely monitored the “enormous changes” in the college football landscape.“We are thrilled to welcome Reggie Bush back to the Heisman family in recognition of his collegiate accomplishments,” Michael Comerford, president of The Heisman Trophy Trust, said in a statement.In a post on Instagram, Bush wrote, “No one can take from you what God has for you,” along with a picture of his Heisman Trophy.Bush won the Heisman, awarded annually to the most outstanding collegiate football player, in 2005 when he rushed for 1,740 yards on 200 carries and scored 18 total touchdowns for the University of Southern California.In 2010, Bush voluntarily gave up the coveted award after an NCAA investigation found he received benefits of several thousand dollars and a vehicle that were not allowed at the time and he was ruled ineligible as of 2004.College athletes can now receive compensation for their name, image and likeness, known commonly as NIL.A 2021 statement from the NCAA said its rules still prohibited “pay-for-play type arrangements” based on the recent changes to NIL rules and “previous penatlies, including those that are several years old, will not be re-evaluated or reconsidered.”Bush has said the NCAA defamed him and filed a lawsuit against the collegiate sports governing body. He has said he wasn’t paid to play football at USC.“[The NCAA] had to be forced into this,” Bush told The Athletic in 2020 following the introduction of NIL. “Unfortunately, in this country, we’re very reactive. We’re not proactive. Something had to happen first for people to want to change it or for people to see that there is an actual injustice there. Unfortunately, I feel like it had to come with me.“There are certain steps and certain events that open people’s eyes and change people’s perspectives on things. I think that was one of them. It was important for us to get here to where we are now. Hopefully, thousands and thousands of kids will benefit from this point going forward,” he added.Bush will also be invited to future Heisman Trophy ceremonies and USC will receive a replica trophy.“I am grateful to once again be recognized as the recipient of the Heisman Trophy,” Bush said in a statement released by his representatives. “This reinstatement is not only a personal victory but also a validation of the tireless efforts of my supporters and advocates who have stood by me throughout this arduous journey.“I want to make it abundantly clear that I have always acted with integrity and in accordance with the rules and regulations set forth by the NCAA. The allegations brought against me were unfounded and unsupported by evidence, and I am grateful that the truth is finally prevailing.”With Bush’s reinstatement, USC has the most Heisman Trophy winners in college football, with eight.Former NFL quarterback and 2012 Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel thanked the Trust “for doing what’s right and welcoming a storied member of our history back into the fold.”“There were many voices throughout this process that stood on the table for Reggie simply because of the kind of human being he is. I look forward to being on that stage with you this December @ReggieBush you deserve it” Manziel wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.Following his three seasons with USC, Bush played 11 seasons in the NFL with the New Orleans Saints, Miami Dolphins, Detroit Lions, San Francisco 49ers and Buffalo Bills, rushing for 5,490 yards and 36 touchdowns and catching 477 passes for 3,598 yards and 18 TDs in 134 regular season games.

Brenda Goodman,"When the US Department of Agriculture announced late Sunday that it had publicly posted new data from its investigation into a bird flu outbreak in cattle, scientists eagerly searched a well-known platform used globally to share the genetic sequences of viruses.The sequences weren’t there. As of Tuesday morning, they still aren’t.Researchers looking to track the evolution and spread of H5N1 say the information that was posted — raw data on a US server — isn’t very useful and is anything but transparent. They also say the government’s release of information in the outbreak, which was confirmed in cattle almost a month ago, has been painfully slow.After Sunday’s announcement by the USDA, Dr. Rick Bright, an immunologist and vaccine researcher who led the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority from 2016 to 2020, said he immediately called his contacts at the database, called the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, or GISAID, to make sure he wasn’t missing something.“I said ‘Look, just tell me: Do you have data?’ and they said ‘No,’” Bright said.After checking even parts of the database where people can post rough drafts of sequences prior to full public release, Dr. Lucas Freitas, a Brazilian data scientist who is the GISAID curation lead, confirmed there are no new sequences posted by the USDA since its announcement.“We wouldn’t miss it,” said Peter Bogner, founder and president of GISAID. “H5 is the reason GISAID came about to begin with. It raises antennas.”The highly pathogenic avian influenza strain H5N1 has decimated bird populations around the world, and in recent years, has moved into a growing variety of mammals, raising concern that it’s a step closer to becoming a virus that can spread efficiently in people.When the USDA confirmed that H5N1 had been detected in dairy cows in Texas and Kansas on March 25, the news put infectious disease experts on alert, and they were eager to get more information to see how the virus had changed to target a new host. The USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS, says H5N1 has now been found in 32 herds in eight states.But weeks have gone by, and little data on the US outbreak has been shared with the global scientific community.In its notice posted Sunday, APHIS said it had shared 239 genetic sequences from the H5N1 outbreak “from cattle, cats, chickens, skunk, racoon, grackle, blackbird, and goose.”The agency said it “routinely publishes” on GISAID, but in the interest of public transparency and “ensuring the scientific community has access to this information as quickly as possible …” it was “also rapidly sharing” sequences to a US database maintained by the National Library of Medicine.The announcement suggested to many scientists that the information would be found in GISAID, which has been critical to tracking the evolution of the virus that causes Covid-19 as it moves around the world. Many countries, including the United States, use GISAID to quickly share genetic sequences — the exact order of four chemical building blocks that make up the blueprints of each virus.Instead, the USDA uploaded raw sequencing data, called FASTQ files, to the National Library of Medicine database, which is available to the public. These FASTQ files, however, lack the critical information necessary to help scientists track the evolution of the virus, such as the exact date the sample was collected and what state it came from.Scientists do use raw data when tracking the evolution of a virus, but they also typically use it in concert with the type of information that is typically posted to GISAID: consensus sequences, known as FASTA files, which have been refined and cleared of contamination and mistakes. Consensus sequences typically give more information about where the sample was collected and when, helping researchers better understand how a virus is changing over time.Researchers say it’s not clear how recently the samples that are the basis for the raw data were taken. The only dates posted say “2024,” and the locations are only listed as “USA.” There’s no information on how the samples were obtained — whether they come from swabs of an animal’s respiratory tract its skin, or somewhere else.In response to emailed questions from CNN, Shilo Weir, a public affairs specialist for USDA, said the agency had posted the raw data to the US server in the interest of speed and said the agency would work quickly to get curated sequences to GISAID.“APHIS typically posts curated sequence data on the GISAID platform. However, in order to make sequence data public as soon as possible, APHIS uploaded these unanalyzed sequence data files to NCBI,” Weir wrote in the emailed response.“These sequences will not be curated before posting, but this approach will allow us the most rapid path to posting sequence information. APHIS will continue to work as quickly as possible to publish to GISAID curated files that incorporate and analyze relevant epidemiologic information along with the sequence data,” Weir said.It’s also not clear whether the latest release represents all the genomes the agency has.Dr. Michael Worobey, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona, said the USDA was making a mistake by not sharing all the information it has as quickly as possible.“There’s a whole community around the world of people like me and my colleagues, who have a lot of experience with this and often can see things or do analyses that might show something that others have missed,” Worobey said.“You don’t want essentially one group to be the only ones looking at the data. You want everyone, all the experts around the world to be able to do that,” Worobey added.Dr. Tom Inglesby, who directs the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, said USDA’s public release of the raw data was a step in the right direction, but it didn’t go far enough.“The additional information would be quite useful for the public and for scientists and public health agencies, research organizations to understand all of the data that has been collected so far, what farms have been tested, when they were tested, what the sampling strategy is, overall, what kind of testing is going on now, around the country,” he said.“Now that we know that there are asymptomatic cows that have tested positive, what’s the strategy to understand the extent to which cows are infected that don’t have symptoms in other herds? Because I think the most important objective here is to get a full picture of the outbreak.”Influenza viruses change quickly and have caused some of the most devastating pandemics throughout history.“What we’re seeing right now is chapter one of the book that keeps people like me and many infectious disease epidemiologists up at night,” said Dr. Michael Mina, who is chief scientific officer of the telehealth company eMed and an expert in the epidemiology, immunology and spread of infectious disease.The Covid pandemic was bad, but Mina said a pandemic caused by this virus could be worse.“The genie is not out of the bottle yet, and that’s a good thing,” Mina said, but given the potential consequences of letting the virus spread unchecked, “It’s a little bit hard to suggest we could be doing too much right now.”Scientists have followed H5N1 for roughly two decades as it ripped through populations of wild and domestic birds and more recently marine mammals like sea lions, but human-to-human spread after contact with animals has been sporadic and not sustained, suggesting the virus has not mutated enough to become a fully human pathogen. There’s been no evidence of person-to-person spread in the current US outbreak, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Humans have been infected after contact with animals, however — a chilling reminder that the virus still has us in its sights and requires close monitoring.“It’s so critical that the US government is being as transparent as they can right now, overly transparent, and sharing all of these sequences and all of this data so the world can look at it and make their own risk assessments and start making their own vaccine if they need to in their own countries instead of waiting for the United States to say what’s good and what’s bad,” said Bright, who is CEO of Bright Global Health in Washington, DC.“What would we say if this particular virus did get out of control?” Bright said. “Would we look back on this last two or three months and say: ‘I wish we would have done something else; I wish we would have been more transparent; I wish we would have shared all these sequences so the world can get ready for this?’”",2024-04-23 21:25:00 PM EEST,CNN,Scientists say USDA is sharing too little data too slowly on H5N1 flu,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/23/health/h5n1-usda-gisaid-genetic-sequences/index.html
Devan Cole,"Amid calls for Justice Clarence Thomas to recuse himself from a high-stakes case over whether Donald Trump has presidential immunity from criminal prosecution, the conservative jurist has made clear that he doesn’t plan to step aside – or even respond publicly to the appeals from Democrats and others.The justice’s critics are all citing past efforts by his wife, Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, to reverse the 2020 presidential election in Trump’s favor and her attendance at the rally Trump held on January 6, 2021, shortly before the US Capitol attack.Thus far, Thomas has given no sign that he intends to recuse himself from Trump v. US – or even explain his reasoning for remaining on the case, which the nine justices will hear arguments in on Thursday.Judicial ethics experts say that Thomas at least has an obligation to explain his decision not to recuse himself given the precedent set by other justices in the past.“Reasonable people are questioning Justice Thomas’ partiality and I think I think he definitely owes the American people an explanation of why he is unbiased in these cases,” said Gabe Roth, executive director of Fix the Court, which has pushed for more transparency from the federal judiciary.“I think that’s a fairly low bar,” Roth added. “You think you’re unbiased, OK, tell us why.”The court has not responded to CNN’s requests for comment.Supreme Court justices have carte blanche over recusal decisions. The nine adhere to a code of conduct released by the court last year in response to a series of ethics controversies, and they also follow the code enforced against lower-court judges and comply with federal law governing certain judicial conduct, including recusals.The code says in part that a justice should recuse themselves “in a proceeding in which the Justice’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned, that is, where an unbiased and reasonable person who is aware of all relevant circumstances would doubt that the Justice could fairly discharge his or her duties.”But the various recusal rules leave the final decision to the justice, with no formal way for the chief justice or other members of the court to play any role in their colleague’s choice.<h2>‘No one will hold him accountable’</h2>Those calling on Thomas to recuse himself from Thursday’s case are pointing to a series of actions by his wife related to the 2020 election that have been extensively reported on by CNN and other outlets.“He’s still never answered questions about what he knew about his wife’s insurrectionist activities as he sat on cases directly involving those activities,” Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse told CNN in a statement, referring to other January 6-related cases, including one the court heard last week. Whitehouse chairs the Senate Judiciary subcommittee looking into judicial ethics.Thomas has faced a steady stream of recusal calls since December, when special counsel Jack Smith asked the Supreme Court to hear the immunity dispute on an emergency basis.The justices ultimately let the DC Circuit Court of Appeals hear the case first, but a separate dispute over whether Trump should be kicked off of Colorado’s 2024 ballot prompted more recusal calls, including a letter from a group of eight Democratic lawmakers to Justice Thomas that argued Ginni Thomas’ activism should disqualify her husband from participating in that matter.Georgia Rep. Hank Johnson, who spearheaded the letter, told CNN in a statement this week that Thomas’ “refusal to recuse on matters before the court that involve his wife and their personal self-interests is deeply disturbing.”“It further erodes public confidence and trust not just in the Supreme Court, but our very democracy,” added Johnson, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary subcommittee that oversees the federal courts. “He refuses to recuse because he knows no one will hold him accountable,”In an interview Ginni Thomas gave two years ago, the conservative activist said that although she attended the “Stop the Steal” rally held by Trump on January 6, 2021, she “played no role” in planning the events that day and that she does not involve her husband in the political work she does.Critics have also seized on the fact that Ginni Thomas had exchanged texts with Mark Meadows – then-President Donald Trump’s White House chief of staff – about Trump’s efforts to overturn the results. Meadows has also sought to invoke immunity in the Georgia election subversion case, an argument rebuffed by federal courts.“Help This Great President stand firm, Mark!!! … You are the leader, with him, who is standing for America’s constitutional governance at the precipice. The majority knows Biden and the Left is attempting the greatest Heist of our History,” she wrote November 10, 2020, in one such text.In her interview two years ago, Ginni Thomas said she was “disappointed and frustrated that there was violence that happened following a peaceful gathering of Trump supporters on the Ellipse on January 6th.”For his part, Justice Thomas has never publicly commented on his wife’s attendance at the January 6 rally or her efforts to reverse the election results.The code adopted by the justices last year is careful to note that any recusal from a justice could be especially consequential given the fact that the justice could not be swapped out for an alternate jurist, which is possible at the lower-court level.“The loss of even one Justice may undermine the ‘fruitful interchange of minds which is indispensable’ to the Court’s decision-making process,” the newly adopted code states.Trump is asking the court to grant him presidential immunity from prosecution in the federal election subversion case brought against him by Smith. Lower courts sided against the former president, ruling that no such immunity exists.If Thomas were to recuse himself from the case and the court split 4-4, that outcome would allow the historic criminal prosecution to proceed.<h2>Recusals at the high court</h2>Recusals at the Supreme Court are not unheard of.Last September, Justice Samuel Alito issued a defiant explanation for why he was refusing to recuse himself from a major tax case the court would soon hear, sharply rejecting calls by some Democrats for him to step aside after he gave an interview to one of the attorneys involved in the case.“There is no valid reason for my recusal in this case,” the conservative justice wrote in a 4-page statement responding to the appeals from Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin and others. The Illinois Democrat has also urged Thomas to step aside from the Trump cases before the court this year.Other recusal issues are less controversial, such as when a justice steps aside from a case because they handled the matter when they were serving as a lower-court judge.Liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson recused herself from the Harvard affirmative action case the court decided last year because she had served on the school’s Board of Overseers before joining the court. (Jackson did take part in a similar case centered on the University of North Carolina that was argued and decided at the same time.)And in 2020, the court announced that Justice Sonia Sotomayor would not take part in a case concerning so-called faithless presidential electors. The court’s clerk said at the time that the liberal justice “believes that her impartiality might reasonably be questioned” due to her friendship with one of the litigants in the case.Thomas, too, has occasionally recused himself from a case. In one notable example last fall, he said that he did not participate in the court’s consideration of an appeal brought by former Trump attorney John Eastman in a January 6-related case. Though he did not explain the reasoning for his recusal in that matter, Eastman is one of Thomas’ former clerks.Thomas’ recusal in that case remains the only time he sat out of a January 6 case before the high court.",2024-04-25 12:00:00 PM EEST,CNN,Justice Clarence Thomas chooses not to recuse himself from another January 6-related case,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/25/politics/clarence-thomas-january-6-case/index.html
Brenda Goodman,"The US Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that it had detected viral particles of H5N1 avian influenza in milk purchased at grocery stores, but the agency says it still believes that the milk is safe to drink.In an update about an ongoing outbreak of bird flu in cattle, the FDA noted that it believes the viral particles were detected by highly sensitive lab tests and are likely to have been remnants of viruses killed during the pasteurization process. The agency said that it does not think it is likely that the particles would able to infect people but it is conducting additional tests to be completely sure.The FDA said these egg inoculation tests are “a gold-standard” for determining whether a virus is still viable and able to infect people.“To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe. Results from multiple studies will be made available in the next few days to weeks,” the agency said.Dr. Eric Topol, founder of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said the finding of viral particles in milk on grocery store shelves means the outbreak is probably more widespread than we’ve known.“The dissemination to cows is far greater than we have been led to believe,” Topol said in an email Tuesday.“The FDA assurance that the dairy supply is safe is nice, but it’s not based on extensive assessment yet, which they acknowledge, and won’t engender trust and confidence because it comes in the wake of USDA mishandling,” he added.The US Department of Agriculture confirmed in late March that it had detected highly pathogenic avian influenza in dairy cows in Texas and Kansas, which was the first time a virus that has been decimating bird populations around the globe had shown up in cattle. Since then, infected cows have been confirmed in more than 30 farms across eight states. Scientists have said the USDA is sharing too little information about the virus and too slowly.The infected cows stopped eating as much as they usually did, and their milk became thickened and discolored. Veterinarians running tests on the animals found that the milk was teeming with the virus, although samples from their lungs didn’t show much evidence of infection, leading the doctors to believe that the animals’ mammary glands were directly infected, perhaps through shared milking equipment.Researchers are still trying to determine how cows initially became infected and how the virus is spreading between animals.Cats that have lived on the same farms as infected cows have died, perhaps after exposure to their milk.The FDA said Tuesday that milk from sick cows is being “diverted or destroyed,” while milk sold in interstate commerce is being pasteurized, a process that heats it briefly to kill microbes.“Even if virus is detected in raw milk, pasteurization is generally expected to eliminate pathogens to a level that does not pose a risk to consumer health,” the FDA stated.The agency said 99% of milk in the commercial supply comes from farms that follow the pasteurized milk ordinance, “which includes controls that help ensure the safety of dairy products.” However, it noted that pasteurization doesn’t render milk completely sterile.For that reason, it has been running tests on milk samples collected at grocery stores across the country. It is also collaborating with the food safety group at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The FDA has long recommended that consumers not drink unpasteurized or raw milk because of the possibility that it may harbor germs that can pose serious health risks.So far, efforts to track the spread of the current oubreak have relied on voluntary reporting.The USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service keeps a list of diseases that are required to be reported in animals. Although avian influenza, or bird flu, is required to be reported in poultry and wild birds, reporting is not required in cattle.“No one ever thought it was going to be in cows,” said Dr. Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization’s coordinating center for studies on the ecology of influenza at St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital.“You wouldn’t even think of an H5N1 in cows being something you’d ever have to worry about, and I think that’s where it’s fallen through the cracks a little bit.”Not only does the USDA require reporting of H5N1 in poultry, it rewards producers for reporting at the first sign of illness in their flock and financially compensates them for birds and eggs that are destroyed to contain an outbreak. This approach has encouraged farmers to be forthcoming with information, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.There are no such policies in place to encourage reporting in other livestock.Osterholm said his major worry is that the outbreak could spread to pigs, since farms that keep cows often keep other types of animals, too.Flu viruses enter cells through sialic acids, which serve as entry points. Right now, the H5N1 virus hasn’t learned to efficiently access the human version of the sialic acid receptor.Pigs have the same sialic acid receptors as both birds and humans in their respiratory tracts. If H5N1 causes a large outbreak in pigs, Osterholm said, it would give the virus a perfect opportunity to learn to attach to human sialic acids.“Pigs are a more efficient mixing bowl,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, a professor of pediatrics, molecular virology and microbiology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. “The one thing about where we are in Texas is that, in addition to those cattle, Texas is the epicenter of the feral hog population.”“In the United States, we have 30% of the nation’s feral hogs, 2 to 3 million feral hogs, and so that to me is a potential risk, as well,” he said.The USDA said it has encouraged farmers and ranchers to report cases of sick cattle to state animal health officials.But neither cows nor the people who work or live around them are being widely screened for the infection, which would require informed consent. Testing of wastewater in areas with outbreaks is also being discussed.Instead, the CDC is monitoring emergency department data and flu testing data in areas where H5N1 viruses have been detected in dairy cattle for any unusual trends in flu-like illness, flu or conjunctivitis. “So far, these data remain in expected ranges, and to date, surveillance systems do not show any unusual trends or activity,” according to information in a statement compiled by officials at the CDC.CDC spokesperson Jason McDonald said that 23 people with exposures to H5N1 had been tested, including one person in Texas who previously tested positive. No other people have tested positive in the current outbreak, he said.",2024-04-24 03:27:00 AM EEST,CNN,FDA finds traces of H5N1 bird flu viruses in grocery store milk but says pasteurized dairy products are still safe,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/23/health/bird-flu-milk-fda/index.html
Ben Morse,"Angel Reese said she is “super excited” by the “really great direction” that the WNBA is heading in, after being drafted into the league by the Chicago Sky earlier this month.Reese was selected by the Sky with the No. 7 pick in the 2024 WNBA draft, pairing her up with former South Carolina star Kamilla Cardoso – who had been picked No. 3 – in what looks likely to prove a formidable front court.In her introductory press conference with Chicago on Wednesday, the 21-year-old spoke about what she’s gleaned already from her fellow professionals.“Being able to talk to a lot of the vets, they were telling me they were super excited for us to come here and be in this amazing league and being able to be embraced by vets is something that I love and being able to be appreciated,” Reese told reporters.“They understand and they know our impact and they embrace that and we’re all just trying to go in the right direction, and I think we’re going up right now. Being able to see so many different things with the networks, with the ticket sales, with the jersey sales, like, I think we’re in a really great direction and having support from your vets is amazing.”Reese enters the WNBA as a bonafide star in women’s basketball having risen to the top with LSU.The forward was named SEC Player of the Year last year and was a three-time AP All-American; Reese also won the national title with LSU in 2023.Away from the court, Reese is still a recognizable figure across the US, with her and Caitlin Clark leading women’s basketball’s recent popularity surge.And the former LSU Tiger addressed the spotlight she has found herself in recently as she transfers to the pro game.“I think I’ve taken on that role, a lot of players have, a lot of the players in my class,” Reese said when asked how she’s handled being a celebrity athlete.“I think it was a really historic class and being able to change things going into the right direction is really important and I think our impact and our platform that we have and we’ve used at a great level I think is really inspiring to so many people right now.”<h2>Advice from a legend</h2>One person who knows a thing or two about handling the transition from college to professional basketball is Reese’s fellow LSU alum Shaquille O’Neal.O’Neal had a stellar career with the Tigers before being drafted with the No. 1 overall pick in the 1992 NBA draft. He would go on to win four NBA titles and retire as one of the league’s all-time greats.Last year, Shaq called Reese “probably the greatest athlete ever to come out of LSU sports.”Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Reese talked about all the help O’Neal has been providing her as she makes the jump to the WNBA.“Yeah, I talked to [O’Neal]. He congratulated me after I got drafted, of course,” she said. “He’s been super inspirational to me.“He talked to me about when he went into the league as a rookie and just being able to go in and just try to dominate and just be able to learn and understand, but don’t take any prisoners. Go in with an open mindset, of course, but you know what’s on the line and what you want to live up to.”Reese will join Cardoso in Chicago as they look to improve on the team’s defeat in the first round of the 2023 playoffs at the hands of the eventual champion Las Vegas Aces.Cardoso was a two-time NCAA national champion with South Carolina and enters the league with the potential of becoming one of the WNBA’s most dominant centers.In Reese and Cardoso, the Sky have a potentially game-changing frontcourt and the former LSU star is excited with what’s to come in the Windy City.“I’ve been playing Kamilla since high school, so I’ve always known what she can do,” she said. “Being able to have a post player that can run rim-to-rim as fast as she can and me being able to go with her and run with her.“I mean, if I miss a defensive assignment, she’s gonna be there and if she misses a defensive assignment, I’m gonna be there.”",2024-04-25 13:24:00 PM EEST,CNN,Angel Reese ‘super excited’ for ‘direction’ of WNBA and details ‘inspirational’ mentor Shaquille O’Neal,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/25/sport/angel-reese-chicago-sky-introduction-shaquille-oneal-spt-intl/index.html
Anna Cooban,"Mining giant BHP has made a near-$40 billion bid to take over its UK rival Anglo American in what would be the largest mining deal on record.BHP said in a statement Thursday that it valued Anglo American shares at £25.08 ($31.40) apiece, or £31.1 billion ($38.9 billion) in total. If completed, the acquisition would increase BHP’s access to copper reserves, it added.The potential deal would have a higher value than the $38.3 billion acquisition of Switzerland’s Xstrata by commodities company Glencore in 2012, according to Dealogic data. It would also be the biggest merger or acquisition in the mining industry by value since Dealogic began collecting the data in 2004.Anglo American’s board is “currently reviewing this proposal,” the company said in a statement, adding that there was “no certainty” a formal offer would be made by BHP, or the terms of that potential offer.BHP has until May 22 to make a formal offer.Shares in Anglo American soared as much as 13.8% on the news. By 5.47 a.m. ET, they were trading at £24.55 ($30.72). Shares in BHP closed 0.6% down in Australia.Copper is an essential component in some renewable energy technologies, including solar panels and electric vehicles. And it is in high demand: The price of the metal on the London Metals Exchange has risen more than 13% so far this year to almost $10,000 a metric ton, its highest level in about two years.A year ago, BHP acquired Australian rival Oz Minerals to widen its access to copper and nickel. The buyout was part of BHP’s strategy to “meet increasing demand for the critical minerals needed for electric vehicles, wind turbines and solar panels,” company CEO Mike Henry said in a statement at the time.The approach by BHP may also fuel concerns about some of the United Kingdom’s biggest companies leaving the London Stock Exchange.The buyout offer “will send a fresh chill through the City of London,” Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, wrote in a note Thursday. “There are concerns that, if the deal goes through, it could be the tip of the iceberg and more giants could leave the exchange.”Rob North contributed reporting.

Our backs are against the wall. Everybody’s against us. So just use that as fuel.“Our guys believe we can win. So, let’s make it mano a mano – a cage fight. Let’s hoop.”Feeling confident, Butler posted a photo on Instagram of his face photoshopped onto Celtics star Jaylen Brown’s body.
