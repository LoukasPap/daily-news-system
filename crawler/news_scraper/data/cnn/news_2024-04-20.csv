GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson may finally be primed to defy the right wing of his party and allow a bipartisan majority to bless the aid six months after it was requested by the White House.Key line: “Conservative hardliners were quickly fuming at Johnson for his decision to move ahead with billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine and loudly warning him it could cost him his job.”What’s clear from the water facility hack is that Russia continues to meddle in the US, either by attacking infrastructure or meddling in elections.What’s clear from the Ukraine funding story is that a very small minority of lawmakers, with help from right-wing media, does not view Russia as much of a threat.While it is mostly Republicans who oppose additional funding for Ukraine, they are still a minority, even within their own party. In February, 22 Republicans in the Senate joined all but three Democrats to form a 70-vote majority in favor of the funding. It’s fair to think a similar bipartisan majority would support Ukraine funding in the House’s latest foreign aid package unveiled on Wednesday.“We’re the greatest nation on the planet and we have to act like it,” Johnson told CNN’s Jake Tapper in an interview on “The Lead” on Wednesday. He defended his plan, promised a future bill would address the Republican priority of border security and argued that the vast majority of $60 billion in Ukraine aid would go to US defense contractors.“The responsibility for the free world has been shifted onto our shoulders,” he said, adding US troops would not be committed in Ukraine. “We’re not the world’s policeman.”Not all Republicans are buying the pitch, and the divide within the GOP over Ukraine is getting more heated, which is jeopardizing Johnson’s ability to lead. CNN’s Capitol Hill team reports that some potential Johnson rivals are quietly positioning themselves in case there is yet another ousted speaker.Johnson’s Republican critics, meanwhile, are getting louder.Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz described Johnson’s strategy, a complicated four-part parliamentary gambit to tie aid for Ukraine with aid for Israel, Taiwan and the US border, as “surrender.”Texas Rep. Chip Roy didn’t commit to voting to oust Johnson but said he’s “past the point of giving grace” to the still-new speaker.And they aren’t even the two Republicans who have already said they would soon vote to end Johnson’s speakership, although it’s not clear when.The first who’s already on the record is Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who described Ukraine as “the only country that for some weird, sick and evil reason that they care about.” She was referring to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, who has raised the alarm about the threat of Russia to the rest of the world if Ukraine falls.The other Republican already publicly in favor of ousting Johnson is Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky. He praised Tucker Carlson for that softball interview the former Fox News host conducted with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this year. That’s the interview CNN’s media team described as a “propaganda victory” for Putin.Johnson may need help from moderate Democrats to fend off the effort to oust him, and a few Democrats have said they would break tradition and cross party lines to support him. It’s not clear if Johnson would want the help, since party loyalty is prized in the GOP.The Russia divide is clearly testing that loyalty. Former Rep. Liz Cheney, the Republican from Wyoming, who was ousted for her opposition to former President Donald Trump, has referred to the “Putin wing” of the GOP as a threat to the US.Rep. Michael McCaul, the Texas Republican who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told Puck News this month that Russian propaganda has “infected a good chunk of my party’s base,” threatening the Ukraine aid.Asked about that propaganda comment by Tapper earlier this month, Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, agreed.“Oh, it is absolutely true,” he said.“To the extent that this propaganda takes hold, it makes it more difficult for us to really see this as an authoritarian-versus-democracy battle, which is what it is,” Turner said.Greene, who former Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado described as “Moscow Marjorie” during one recent CNN interview, has said on conservative media outlets that she is not concerned that Putin’s aggression against Ukraine will spread.In a post on X this past weekend, she suggested US military funding would go to “Ukrainian Nazis,” repeating a false claim about Ukraine pushed by Putin.Johnson still has the key support of Trump. The two appeared together at Mar-a-Lago last week, and Johnson has bought into Trump’s proposal to structure some Ukraine aid as a loan rather than direct aid. While Democrats have long complained that Trump shows deference to Putin, Johnson made the argument to Tapper that Trump could negotiate a peace deal in Ukraine.Johnson said he’s not going to be consumed by thinking about efforts within his own party to oust him. “Right now I gotta do my job,” he said, although he refused to comment on what would happen if Democrats ultimately vote to keep him as speaker. “When you do the right thing, you let the chips fall where they may,” he said.",2024-04-17 17:28:00,Some House Republicans need this reminder that Russia is not their friend,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/17/politics/republicans-russia-ukraine-what-matters/index.html

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.While former President Donald Trump is spinning conspiracy theories about people infiltrating the jury in his hush money criminal trial, the judge in the case is finding it difficult to protect jurors’ anonymity.Anonymity for juries like the one being formed to hear charges in New York against Trump is supposed to add a layer of protection for jurors doing their civic duty. Once reserved only for cases involving violent criminal enterprises, the practice is becoming more common. It’s usually employed for high-profile cases but also at will by judges in some states. Rules vary.RELATED: Full 12-person jury set for Trump trial after Thursday proceedings. Alternates still needed.The concept of anonymous juries is still relatively new; the first in US history was empaneled in New York in 1977 for the trial of Leroy “Nicky” Barnes, a drug kingpin known as Mr. Untouchable, according to The New York Times. Barnes, famous for avoiding conviction, caught the attention of then-President Jimmy Carter, who told the Justice Department to take special care with the case, which yielded a guilty verdict.Even the lawyers in that case weren’t permitted to know the identities of the jurors, a step further than the precautions in place for the Trump trial in New York. Both prosecutors and Trump’s defense have been poring over the social media profiles and pasts of potential jurors in Judge Juan Merchan’s courtroom.Merchan issued an order in March agreeing with prosecutors that most information about the jurors would be sealed. Trump’s lawyers did not disagree, according to the order.A separate Trump-related jury, the one that found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation of E. Jean Carroll, was fully anonymous – like the one that convicted Barnes – and the identities of jurors were not known to lawyers on either side.CNN’s Jeremy Herb recently wrote about how Trump has acted around juries before this current case.In this hyperconnected social media age, anonymity is hard to achieve. One juror who had been sworn onto the panel on Tuesday was excused by Merchan on Thursday after she said her anonymity was blown.“Yesterday alone, I had friends, colleagues and family push things to my phone questioning my identity as a juror,” the former Juror No. 2 told Merchan.Merchan admonished the press for publishing information that could identify jurors.“We just lost what probably would’ve been a very good juror,” Merchan said in court. “The first thing she said was she was afraid and intimidated by the press.”Read more about Merchan scolding the press from CNN’s Hadas Gold.Trump, ever trying to chip away at the justice system that is prosecuting him, seeded a new conspiracy theory by posting a quote on social media, attributed to Fox News host Jesse Watters, that “undercover Liberal Activists” were trying to get on the jury.Set aside the fact that there is no evidence to support this claim – and consider that the prosecution needs every juror to agree with them to get a guilty verdict, while Trump just needs one to vote for acquittal to result in a hung jury. Meanwhile, a special hearing on whether Trump has violated a gag order for his continued social media attacks is set for next week.<h2>When anonymous juries go wrong</h2>Maybe Trump remembers one of the most infamous, anonymous jury incidents, featuring another famous New Yorker, the mob boss John Gotti.The anonymity of jurors in that case from 1987 allowed the jury foreman, who just so happened to have organized crime connections, to contact Gotti and, in exchange for bribes, guarantee a hung jury.The informer who turned on Gotti, Salvatore “Sammy the Bull” Gravano, also told authorities the juror, George Pape, had been bought off. Pape voted to acquit Gotti, but so did the 11 other jurors. The contaminated acquittal stood since the Constitution protects against double jeopardy, according to a New York Times report at the time. Gotti later went to prison after a subsequent conviction on different charges.Clearly there’s a massive difference between a major push by the federal government to go after organized crime in the 1980s with racketeering charges and Trump’s prosecution for the Class E felony of falsifying a business record in furtherance of campaign violations.But the unyielding support Trump commands from his supporters and the violent things they will do on his behalf, like storming the US Capitol, suggest this is the type of case where anonymity is clearly warranted – although the practice of anonymous juries is in tension with the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution, which guarantees a public, fair and speedy trial by an impartial jury.<h2>What we know</h2>Merchan told news outlets to better refrain from reporting details that could unmask the jurors, like physical descriptions, and prohibited them from including elements that are on a jury questionnaire, like their places of business.There is known, public information about the jurors – their genders, professions, family situations and more – that it’s reasonable to think they could be unmasked by determined internet sleuths or loose-lipped acquaintances.Investigations into the jurors are also being conducted in real time during this process. Trump’s defense was scrolling through old social media posts and asking jurors about them.Prosecutors are looking for flaws with jurors. Another juror, a Puerto Rican grandfather who had said he finds Trump “fascinating and mysterious,” was also dismissed Thursday. The exact circumstances of his dismissal are not clear, but prosecutors informed the judge their review of criminal records showed a person sharing the man’s name was arrested in the 1990s for tearing down political advertisements.<h2>A jolting experience</h2>Thursday’s court session ended with a full, 12-person jury being seated. These jurors will be asked to take on the weight of sitting in judgment of a former and maybe future president.“Jurors show up, and a lot of times, they don’t think they’re going to end up being selected for whatever reason. And so when they go through the process, as soon as they’re sworn in a panel, that can be pretty jolting,” the jury consultant Alan Tuerkheimer told CNN’s Omar Jimenez in an interview on Max. “That can be for a regular case. So think about this case,” he added.",2024-04-18 17:56:00,Why is the Trump trial jury anonymous?

Zachary B. Wolf,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.It was a week of unexpected developments in an unpredictable but consequential election year.Here are the surprise developments and what they could mean for the future:<h2>Jury set for Trump’s first trial</h2>Unless you’ve been stranded off the grid in Antarctica, you know that former President Donald Trump is on trial in New York on charges of falsifying business records related to hush money payments made before the 2016 election. This overriding lead story was the subject of blanket TV coverage and banner headlines.The surprise is that a jury selection process predicted to take weeks was over in days. Twelve jurors and six alternates will sit in judgment of the former president.There were multiple hiccups, such as when one juror reconsidered her ability to remain impartial or when a self-immolation created a scene outside the courthouse.But the end result is the most important thing. The first of four potential criminal trials of Trump is happening. Opening arguments get underway next week.We can’t say exactly who will testify because the prosecution won’t tell Trump’s team which witnesses they will call first. They anticipate Trump will violate a gag order and trash talk whoever takes the stand.What we do know is that Trump has already tried to seed a conspiracy theory that the jury is somehow biased against him. This despite the open process that led to the seating of the anonymous jury.<h2>165 Democrats helped the Republican speaker</h2>“Help” is probably the wrong word. When 165 Democrats voted with 151 Republicans in favor of House Speaker Mike Johnson’s plan to hold votes on aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, it ossified the aggravation at Johnson from the right wing of his party.Three Republicans – Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona – have said they will support a plan to oust Johnson from the speaker’s chair.Johnson, meanwhile, refused to protect himself by changing House rules to make it harder to fire him. He has maintained the support of most Republicans and of Trump. At least for now.The fault lines in the GOP, evident for years, are under immense stress. If Johnson is to keep his spot as speaker, he’ll probably need help as soon as next week from Democrats for that too.It would be something that looks like bipartisan or coalition governing, which would be music to any moderate American’s ears. And if Johnson keeps his position as well as passes what most Americans and lawmakers want, his skill at leadership will deserve a reexamination. More to come next week.<h2>Ukraine is finally going to get more US aid</h2>Most lawmakers in the House and Senate support giving more military aid to Ukraine as it fends off Russia’s invasion. But the opposition of the right wing of the GOP has delayed the aid since the White House requested it in October.Johnson, although a bona fide conservative and a skeptic at times of Ukraine aid, is finally on the cusp of getting the vote done in the House. It’s a major development.But the fight over aid has also uncovered some uncomfortable truths, such as the prominence of the nationalist-veering GOP right wing, which is not afraid to say it doesn’t put much stock in supporting democracies around the world.<h2>Israel and Iran may have averted all-out war, at least for now</h2>Tit-for-tat strikes and responses between Israel and Iran in recent weeks have threatened to spark an all-out conflagration between the two countries.This week, Iran responded to Israel’s strike on a Syrian diplomatic facility with its own strikes, which Israel responded to on Friday with a strike on Iran. But the takeaway of many analysts was that might be it for a while.Here’s Tamara Qiblawi in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter:This month’s dramatic escalation, which kicked off with an apparent Israeli airstrike on Iran’s consulate in Damascus, followed by a largely foiled Iranian attack of over 300 airborne weapons on Israel, seems to have given way to a rapid climbdown. Shortly after the Friday morning attack in Iran, a regional intelligence source told CNN’s Nic Robertson that Iran was not expected to respond further, and that the direct state-to-state strikes between the two enemy states were over. Read more from Qiblawi.<h2>Joe Biden is running hard</h2>With all the Trump trial coverage, you might have missed that President Joe Biden is running a spirited presidential campaign. While Trump is spending most days at his trial, Biden is going all over the map.This week, he was in Philadelphia, where he went to a Wawa, and he was in Pittsburgh, where he went to a Sheetz. He was in Pennsylvania for a three-day swing to push his economic populism. If he can sustain the blue wall that wins Democrats their recent presidencies, it’s this kind of tailored campaigning that will do it.As Trump was spinning conspiracy theories outside his trial, Biden was adopting some of Trump’s message on issues like tariffs, while drawing a bright line between the two of them on the key American issue of protecting democracy.All of Biden’s hard work won’t quiet the critics who point to his age and wonder if he’s up to the job, but it’s impossible to argue the man is not trying very hard to convince people he wants to remain president.<h2>The US economy might be too hot</h2>The term “Bidenomics” is either an insult or a brag, depending on the circumstances.Biden’s economic pitch, as earnest as it was this week, might be a hard sell to Americans who still acutely feel the pinch of inflation and feel priced out of everything from the housing market to the restaurant scene.The International Monetary Fund, meanwhile, is worried not about a US recession, but rather that the US economy is too hot compared with other countries, according to a report released this week. While Europe and other developed countries have yet to reach their pre-pandemic growth levels, the data suggests the US economy has blown past them.“Astonishingly, the US economy has already surged past its pre-pandemic (growth) trend,” IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas wrote in a blog post accompanying the agency’s World Economic Outlook. That means any talk of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in the near future is likely to end.",2024-04-20 06:00:00,6 surprises from a major news week,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/20/politics/surprises-news-week-what-matters/index.html
Stephen Collinson,"It took less than six months for Speaker Mike Johnson to reach his existential moment.The Louisiana Republican has arrived at fateful but familiar crossroads where he must either choose to honor a conventional vision of US national interests or side with the wrecking ball antics of his party’s far-right bloc.It’s a choice with which his immediate predecessors – Kevin McCarthy, Paul Ryan and John Boehner – wrestled before him. Their refusal to lead the US into debt or financial crises or to compromise America’s global role ended up driving them into political oblivion.Now, as Johnson tries to pass billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan — vital to protecting US allies from Russian, Iranian and Chinese totalitarianism and preserving US power and prestige – he’s having to put his own job on the line to confront GOP extremists who accuse him of betraying the party’s base.“When you do the right thing, you let the chips fall where they may,” Johnson said in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on Wednesday ahead of three critical days that could decide whether he can cling to his gavel.The prospects for the rookie speaker look grim. His tiny majority means he can’t afford to lose more than one GOP vote to pass a bill on a party-line vote. And two hardliners, Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, are threatening to call a vote to oust him if he puts the Ukraine bill on the floor.Other right-wing Republicans are warning Johnson must make $60 billion in Ukraine aid conditional on tough new border security measures despite the party’s trashing of the most conservative immigration compromise in decades at presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump’s behest.<h2>Schism in GOP could drive Johnson out</h2>The schism in the GOP highlights how Trump has eroded the party’s internationalist principles in favor of his “America First” creed. Lawmakers like Greene and Texas Rep. Chip Roy counter traditional national security arguments by warning there is no greater US interest than protecting the southern border, following high levels of crossing by undocumented migrants in recent months.Roy, who is yet to decide whether to back an effort to oust Johnson, told CNN Wednesday that he was “disappointed” in the speaker and was “past the point of giving grace.” Johnson’s increasing vulnerability on this issue is particularly acute since he was also arguing for months that there could be no Ukraine aid without using the same measure to force the White House to introduce draconian measures at the US border with Mexico.Rising right-wing opposition to his foreign aid plans has left Johnson in a deeply vulnerable position. To even pass a rule to set up a cascading series of votes on the bills this weekend, Johnson is almost certain to need Democratic votes. The minority party may also have to save him if Greene calls up her motion to vacate the speaker’s chair – a step several Democrats say they are prepared to take to ensure that Ukraine aid will pass at a moment when Kyiv warns it will lose its war of survival without urgent help. This could save Johnson in the short term. But a GOP speaker dependent on Democratic votes will be seen by many Republicans as a tool of the minority party and would be on borrowed time.Johnson’s problem is a more extreme version of one that has dogged Republican speakers for years. A strong but small group of right-wing Republicans elected on absolutist platforms in deep-red districts comes to Washington with an expansive agenda and adamant they won’t compromise with Democrats. But they lack the power or numbers to force their will apart from in the rare phases when Republicans have a monopoly on Washington power. The frustrated extremists then turn on GOP leaders and accuse them of becoming traitors – simply because they live in the land of political reality.For example, Greene told CNN’s Manu Raju on Wednesday: “I don’t know how long people are going to tolerate this because he is doing nothing but serving the Democrats.”<h2>‘We won’t get everything we want’</h2>Johnson, who is facing claims that he’s sold out despite being possibly the most conservative speaker in history, tried to explain his constraints in the interview with Tapper. “The Republicans run the House. We have the smallest majority in the House. The Democrats are in charge of the Senate and the White House. So, by definition, we won’t get everything we want,” he said.The idea, however, that the party should settle for something less than an absolutist position is not one that flies in the modern GOP, where stunt politics that play well on conservative media are as important as legislating. “There’s certain members that just prefer the minority,” Texas GOP Rep. Dan Crenshaw, who supports sending new aid to Ukraine, told CNN’s Raju. “It’s easier, just, you can always just be against something, you never really have to work.”The speaker had seemed to buy himself some time after traveling to Mar-a-Lago last week to bolster Trump’s false claims of election fraud and securing in return about the strongest public endorsement the ex-president is likely to give. Johnson “is doing a very good job,” Trump said. Logic suggests that the presumptive GOP nominee has an interest in delaying a third debacle over electing a GOP speaker since the party won the majority in the 2022 midterm elections because it might distract from his own campaign to take back the White House. Yet Greene, one of Trump’s top supporters, hasn’t taken his hint and is still determined to bring Johnson down. The speaker might be wise not to trust Trump. Loyalty to others is a fungible commodity for the ex-president. Once Trump senses an associate is vulnerable or no longer serves his political interests, he usually casts them loose.Johnson’s push to put foreign aid bills on the floor separately ahead of a possible attempt to jam them together to send to the Senate – another move infuriating hardliners – might be a logical solution in a normal House. In this way, those who oppose Ukraine aid on principle could vote against it, allowing Democrats who support it to ensure its passage. There could be a strong bipartisan vote to help Israel, days after Iran’s air attacks, and to support Taiwan, which is increasingly vulnerable to China’s massive military buildup. And Republicans could get cover by voting for a separate bill that Johnson plans to put on the floor strengthening border security. But the extreme polarization of the GOP majority – and the lack of maneuvering room Johnson has after the “red wave” failed to materialize in the 2022 midterms – gives individual members the opportunity to create chaos and makes governing all but impossible.On Wednesday evening, for example, in another defeat for Johnson, the House Rules Committee recessed because it was unable to pass a rule on the border security bill, with Republicans threatening to vote against the measure in committee.<h2>Johnson’s tonal shift on Ukraine</h2>One of the most interesting aspects of Johnson’s new strategy is the way that he is now forcibly arguing about the need for the US to send billions of dollars in aid to its allies. (In order to placate some Republicans, some economic aid to Ukraine has been refashioned as a loan). As a backbencher, Johnson voted against sending more funds to Ukraine several times and he’s been careful in his six months as speaker not to get too far ahead of GOP critics of bankrolling Kyiv’s war effort.But on Wednesday, he was making the kind of foreign policy argument that could have been voiced by any GOP leader from President Dwight Eisenhower to President George W. Bush – one that was a clear departure from Trumpism.“We are going to stand by Israel, our close ally and dear friend, and we’re going to stand for freedom and make sure that Vladimir Putin doesn’t march through Europe. These are important responsibilities,” Johnson told Tapper. “Since World War II, really, the responsibility for the free world has been shifted onto our shoulders. And we accept that role. We’re an exceptional nation.”Johnson added: “We’re the greatest nation on the planet, and we have to act like it. And we have to project to Putin and Xi and Iran and North Korea and anybody else that we will defend freedom.”It was not immediately clear what has prompted Johnson’s change of emphasis.The shocking magnitude of Iran’s missile and drone attack on Israel last week – even if it was largely repelled by US, Israeli, British and Jordanian military forces – has concentrated minds on Capitol Hill about the urgency of replenishing the Israeli arsenal.Ukraine’s need is even more acute. Russia has continued relentless attacks on civilians and infrastructure, and there have been multiple warnings from top US defense and intelligence officials that without Biden’s vitally needed aid package, Kyiv could lose the war. “I think we’re already seeing things on the battlefield begin to shift a bit in terms of in Russia’s favor,” Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told the House Defense Appropriations subcommittee Wednesday. The implications for a Russian victory would be grave and create new security threats to the West in Europe. And the possibility that the United States would abandon a fellow democracy under assault from a ruthless leader in the Kremlin would shatter the country’s reputation abroad and weaken its power as a result. That may be a stain the speaker doesn’t want on his conscience or as part of his legacy.Johnson, unlike his extremist members, has responsibilities as speaker – one of the great offices of state that go beyond short-term political interests. And he’s been under relentless pressure from foreign leaders, as well as the White House. Biden, for instance, warned in a Wall Street Journal article Wednesday that “both Ukraine and Israel are under attack by brazen adversaries that seek their annihilation.”If Johnson can somehow engineer passage of the bills aiding Israel and Ukraine this weekend, he’d be bolstering a global leadership role the US played for decades. It’s a measure of how much the GOP has changed that such a role might be considered political apostasy and could cost him his job.But he told reporters on Wednesday evening, while making the case that military aid for Ukraine was now critical, “I’m doing here what I believe to be the right thing.”“History judges us for what we do.”",2024-04-18 08:11:00,Doing ‘the right thing’ may cost Johnson his speaker’s gavel,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/17/politics/mike-johnson-foreign-aid-analysis/index.html

Ronald Brownstein,"When Vice President Kamala Harris rushed to Arizona late last week after the state Supreme Court upheld an 1864 law banning abortion in almost all cases, she began her speech with a stark declaration: “This fight is about freedom, and the freedom that is fundamental to the promise of America.”In a new abortion-focused ad that the Biden campaign aired in Arizona last week, President Joe Biden somberly asks: “If Donald Trump gets back in power, what freedom will you lose next?”For Biden, Harris and other Democrats to lean so heavily on the word “freedom” in this campaign is a historic reversal of roles. At least since the New Deal 90 years ago, Republicans have been the party most likely to frame their agenda as advancing “freedom” and “liberty” while Democrats have more often emphasized ideas such as “equality” and “justice.”Republicans haven’t abandoned their rhetorical efforts to claim the terrain of freedom. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, for instance, used the word almost as a mantra the past few years to denounce the restrictions many states imposed to fight the spread of Covid-19 and to attack what he calls the left’s effort to impose “woke ideology.” And Trump disparages Biden’s agenda to promote the deployment of electric vehicles as an attempt to deny Americans’ freedom to continue purchasing gas-powered cars and trucks.But the GOP push at every level of government to roll back the “rights revolution” of the past six decades – symbolized by the proliferation of red-state laws limiting access to abortion and potentially other reproductive health care such as IVF – has provided Democrats a historic opportunity to reverse the direction of this long-running debate, many analysts agree.“Historically, Republicans have rooted their philosophical world view in liberty: for them it’s about freedom to own guns, to practice religion as they see fit” or reducing government taxes, spending and regulation, said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute, which studies the intersection of culture and politics. “What’s new is Democrats are using the term in ways to reimagine what freedom really means.”Transforming the debate over freedom may be especially crucial for Biden because polls consistently show Trump with a double-digit lead when voters are asked who they trust more to handle the economy. That means that to win the election Biden will need to convince a substantial number of voters who believe Trump is better for their bottom line to vote against him anyway. The interrelated issues revolving around rights, values and democracy likely offer the president his best chance to do so. “If any issue” is going to flip voters who express more confidence in Trump on the economy, “it is going to be social issues like abortion,” said Deckman.Biden signaled the central role freedom would play in his campaign messaging from the outset, in the video he released last year announcing his plan to seek reelection. As an ominous piano key trills behind images of the January 6, 2021, insurrection, abortion rights protesters and the White House, Biden opens the video with a stark declaration: “Freedom. Personal freedom is fundamental to who we are as Americans. There’s nothing more important. Nothing more sacred.” Later he says: “The question we’re facing is whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom, more rights or fewer. I know what I want the answer to be, and I think you do too.”The overturning of Roe v. Wade and subsequent wave of red-state laws restricting or banning abortion, not surprisingly, featured prominently in Biden’s announcement video. But he also raised multiple other issues to accuse “MAGA extremists” of threatening “bedrock freedoms,” including book bans, restrictions on voting, “telling people who they can love” (a reference to state laws rolling back LGBTQ rights) and calling for cuts in Social Security.Harris, who has been the administration’s point person in delivering the freedom message, has likewise cast an expansive net. When Harris delivered a Martin Luther King Day speech to the NAACP this year that summarized the administration’s case for another term, she cited all the issues Biden did in the video and others, such as the restrictions several red states have imposed on the teaching of the nation’s racial history and the right “to live free from the horror of gun violence.”Way to Win, a liberal group that funds organizations and campaigns focusing on voters of color, has been pushing the party for several years to emphasize the freedom argument. Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, the group’s vice president and chief strategy officer, says linking all these other issues to abortion is key to portraying Trump and his allies as a threat to freedom.“If [abortion] was the only thing, it would feel different than if you are able to tick off all these other things that they are doing and that they will do,” she said. “We can even say it with other kinds of repro [rights]: We can say it with IVF, or now they are going to come for your contraception. Abortion is an entry point: because it is so visceral for people, it is a way to connect to a larger story about rights and freedoms.”Lauren Hitt, a senior spokesperson for the Biden campaign, argued freedom will be a powerful message for the president because it resonates with a broad range of voters. “It … speaks to the values of traditional Republican voters, [Nikki] Haley primary voters, and suburban voters – as well as to our base who believe deeply that the government shouldn’t be making personal decisions for people,” she said. “It’s a uniquely powerful idea grounded in traditional democratic values that will be critical in winning the swing voters we need to win in November.”The Trump campaign pushed back on Biden’s ad asking which freedom Trump would take away next. “Under Joe Biden, Americans are less free, less safe, and less prosperous,” Karoline Leavitt, the campaign’s national spokesperson, said in a statement.Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said that broad changes in societal attitudes have encouraged both parties to emphasize their commitments to personal freedom. “Each side recognizes this is something people care about,” Cox said. “It’s effective language at a time when we are increasingly individualistic. We are not as inclined to be communitarian and oriented toward the concerns of others. So I think it’s not a surprise that we’re seeing both political parties try to employ this language to their advantage.”Even with all the increased Democratic emphasis on protecting rights, Cox said, the issue remains “contested ground” that can favor either party depending on how it is framed. While Republicans have been “on their heels” defending abortion restrictions such as last week’s Arizona ruling, he said, the party has benefited in other races from positioning itself as defending “parent’s rights,” as Republican Glenn Youngkin did while winning the Virginia governorship in 2021. (It’s notable that when abortion rights and parental rights collided in the 2023 Virginia state legislative elections, Democrats stressing the former won control of both chambers over Republicans emphasizing the latter.)Polling suggests the public remains split over which party it trusts to defend basic rights and freedoms. To begin with, Democrats and Republicans hold very different priorities over which rights are most important to protect, PRRI found in unpublished national polling shared exclusively with CNN. In that survey, conducted late last year, Republicans were most likely to say their freedom to own guns, to practice their religion and to speak their mind was growing more restricted; Democrats were most likely to say that they were losing the freedom to control their own body. “The parties are talking past each other,” Deckman said. “Freedom is a word that is quintessentially American, but it depends on what freedoms you are referring to in the first place.”The public returned a similar split verdict last fall in an NBC poll that asked voters which party they trusted more to handle different issues. In the poll, Democrats held a commanding 18 percentage point advantage on dealing with abortion. But when asked which party they trusted more on “protecting our constitutional rights,” voters preferred Republicans by a margin of 43% to 35%. Even White women, who strongly preferred Democrats on abortion, split evenly over which party they trusted on the broader question of preserving core constitutional rights.That GOP advantage may reflect the traditional political dynamic that conservative voters have been more likely than liberals to believe their rights are under siege and to view government actions as a threat to their liberty. In 2022 polling by Penn State University’s McCourtney Institute for Democracy, Republicans were twice as likely as Democrats to say that they had lost rights and freedoms over the past decade. Republicans were also considerably more likely, though not by as lopsided a margin, to predict that they would lose more rights than they gain over the next decade.The real-world consequence of that imbalance was on display in the 2016 presidential campaign, when Democratic-leaning voters largely shrugged about Hillary Clinton’s warnings that a Trump victory would allow him to move the Supreme Court to the right in a way that would threaten basic rights, like abortion.Chris Wilson, a GOP pollster who worked for the super PAC supporting DeSantis in the 2024 campaign, said the Penn State polling suggests that Biden still will face difficulty mobilizing key elements of the Democratic coalition with a message about rights and freedoms. He noted that such groups as Generation Z, Blacks and Latinos were much less likely than college-educated Whites or Republicans to express fears in the poll that they would lose rights in the decade ahead.“To whatever extent the Democrats are trying to make a rights argument, it’s not as worrying to the youth and to minorities as it is to Whites, people with college degrees, and Boomers,” Wilson said. “Biden’s ‘rights’ argument might be a big hit with his peers, but might be the wrong note to strike if he wants to hold onto the parts of the Democratic coalition that are starting to look shaky.”But the Penn State polling was conducted before the Dobbs decision ended the nationwide right to abortion. And many analysts believe that seismic shift has increased the relevance of questions revolving around rights and freedoms to key groups that Democrats rely on – with younger women especially focused on these threats. While Republicans traditionally responded more to these arguments, Deckman said, “These times certainly have made freedom a more accessible, even an existential, issue for people on the left.”Fernandez Ancona agrees to an extent with both Wilson and Deckman. The 2022 elections, she said, demonstrated how strongly many people react to the risk of losing rights they believed had been settled. “When these things you take for granted are taken away in this very stark way, it’s incredibly motivating,” she said. But she also believes that Democrats need to tie their case about defending personal freedom into a broader message that portrays the 2024 election less as a personal choice between Trump and Biden than as a fundamental crossroads over America’s future priorities that will shape not only personal liberties but also economic opportunity.“We have to get people to shift their thinking about how this is a choice between two different futures,” she said. “It can get people out of this one-to-one candidate-to- candidate [comparison] and asking, ‘what I like, what I don’t like’ about Trump or Biden.”For libertarians, the escalating struggle between Biden and Republicans over the idea of freedom is a source of both bemusement and frustration. Libertarians take a purist position that advocates for minimal government intervention in both personal behavior and the economy; they usually find Republicans deficient on the first count, and Democrats on the second.David Boaz, a distinguished senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, sees those flaws in both Biden and Trump. The Biden administration, Boaz said, is “very big on reproductive freedom, and very big on a lot of aspects of LGBTQ freedom, but beyond those things, where’s the freedom in the Biden-Harris plan?” And while Trump talks about promoting economic freedom by cutting taxes and regulation, Boaz continued, Republicans have also undermined such freedom by promoting high tariffs and using government policy to punish companies they disfavor, as DeSantis did with Disney in Florida.But while Boaz believes both Biden and Trump have imperfect records when it comes to promoting freedom, he thinks one issue breaks the tie between them: Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 election. ﻿“I have friends who say Biden is the biggest spender ever and he’s regulating and he’s woke and how can anyone consider voting for him over Trump?” Boaz said.“And I’ll say that one reason is that Biden has not tried to stop the peaceful transfer of power. That’s a very fundamental issue. You can add up all these [other] issues and weigh them. But the big freedom issue that Biden has over Trump,” Boaz added, “is that Trump tried to steal an election.”",2024-04-17 00:00:00,Why Biden and Democrats are talking so much about freedom,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/16/politics/abortion-democrats-freedom-messaging/index.html
Zachary B. Wolf,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.The first ever criminal trial of a former US president got underway in state court in Manhattan on Monday with the difficult task of finding an impartial jury to sit for a trial that could last months.Despite the high stakes of prosecuting the presumptive Republican presidential candidate and the salacious subject matter involving a 2016 hush money payment to a former adult film star, the trial kickoff previewed weeks of plodding, procedural back-and-forth ﻿and an unusual request for former President Donald Trump to take part in sidebar conversations.Trump’s disdain for the proceedings in which he is the defendant was on display outside the courtroom. On his way in to court Monday, he described the entire trial as “an assault on America” and used social media posts to criticize potential witnesses. A separate hearing has now been scheduled for April 23 to determine if Trump violated a gag order against attacking people involved with the trial.A trial as described by those in the room. Without live or even taped audio or video, the play-by-play was relayed to the outside world by those few reporters actually inside the courtroom.CNN’s Kara Scannell and Jeremy Herb fed information from the court that ultimately made its way to the rest of us.The first order of business in state court in Manhattan is to begin jury selection, a process anticipated to take as long as two weeks. The trial itself, which will take place on weekdays except Wednesdays, could stretch to two full months.Of the first group of 96 potential jurors who crammed into the courtroom, more than half were immediately excused for saying they could not be fair and impartial.Trump wants to take part in sidebars, which could put him very close to jurors. According to Scannell, defendants rarely get involved in sidebars with judges during jury selection, but Trump’s attorneys have indicated he will want to be involved, either approaching the bench or in a side room. This is a rare request.“I have covered about two dozen trials, and I can’t remember one time the defendant opted to go up to the bench as the judge and the attorneys are asking questions of the potential juror,” Scannell said on CNN during a midday courtroom break. “So, this is really remarkable to me that he is choosing to do that, and he will be eye-to-eye with these potential jurors in close proximity as they answer questions.”Searching for 18 impartial people. Ultimately, the field of jurors needs to be winnowed down to 12 jurors and six alternates. Around 500 jurors are expected to be called during each day of jury selection, and Scannell said the court would begin vetting about 100 potential jurors at a time in the courtroom.They will be asked some general questions like whether they have an unbreakable commitment, need a religious exemption or don’t feel they can be impartial.What does impartial mean? It’s ridiculous to think jurors would not have heard of Trump or even have opinions about him. He is, after all, one of the most famous people in the world.Anybody so ignorant of world events so as to not have an impression of Trump would probably not be fit to serve on a jury anyway, writes Jeffrey Abramson, author of “We, The Jury: The Jury System and the Ideal of Democracy.”“An open mind does not require an empty mind,” Abramson argues in a piece for CNN Opinion as he explains the process known as “voir dire.”“We can find fair jurors who understand the difference between law and politics,” Abramson adds, noting that Trump has already faced New York juries who found him liable in civil cases related to defamation and sexual abuse of E. Jean Carroll, a former magazine columnist who said Trump raped her in a department store in 1996, although Trump denies the claim.A Manhattan jury also found Trump’s business, the Trump Organization, guilty of tax evasion, although Trump was not personally named in that case.The jurors will remain anonymous, but Abramson argues both sides in the case need to “sketch a personality profile of each potential juror.” A person with military training, for instance, who values loyalty might be a better juror for Trump, whereas someone who admires whistleblowers might be a better juror for the government, he writes.What will jurors hear? At one point, Judge Juan Merchan read off the names of more than 40 people who could feature in the trial. Potential witnesses range from former Trump aides like Kellyanne Conway and Rudy Giuliani to the women who allege they had affairs with Trump: Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal.CNN’s Kaanita Iyer has a rundown of the key players.And here is an excellent visual timeline of the entire hush money scandal.Much of the morning centered on questions about what evidence Merchan will allow jurors to hear.The judge, per Scannell and Herb’s feeds, will allow:►Testimony from McDougal – She’s the former Playboy Playmate whose story of her alleged affair with Trump was bought by the National Enquirer with the intention of killing it before the 2016 election. But Merchan will not allow testimony about McDougal’s allegation that the affair was conducted while Trump’s wife, Melania, was pregnant and after she gave birth to their son Barron. That kind of testimony, Merchan said, could prejudice the jury against Trump.►National Enquirer stories attacking Trump’s opponents – Prosecutors say Trump was involved in approving these stories.Merchan will not allow:►The infamous “Access Hollywood” tape – It included vulgar language from Trump, and the prosecution says its release just before the 2016 election helped lead to the hush money payment. It cannot be played to jurors, but it can be discussed.►Testimony from Carroll – Separate civil juries found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation of Carroll, but her deposition cannot be shown.What about Michael Cohen? There was also much discussion about what jurors can hear from or about Michael Cohen, Trump’s former fixer and the key witness in the case. It was Cohen who orchestrated the hush money payments and who pleaded guilty to federal charges of violating campaign finance law, for which he served time in prison.Trump is accused by New York of falsifying business records when he paid Cohen back for the hush money scheme. Merchan has a nuanced set of guidelines for how to include the key elements of Cohen’s side of the story without making jurors think Trump is guilty of the crimes Cohen admitted committing.New York Times reporter and CNN political analyst Maggie Haberman noted that Trump had to sit and watch while all of these uncomfortable subjects were discussed in court.“This trial is going to be filled with personal discomfort for Donald Trump, who has often been able to just attack and then walk away,” she told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “This is going to be much harder for him here.”",2024-04-16 08:34:00,Trump has an unusual request on trial Day 1,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/15/politics/trump-trial-day-1-what-matters/index.html
Zachary B. Wolf,"Pro-Palestinian protesters are resorting to ever-louder and intrusive tactics – like shutting down the Golden Gate Bridge during Monday’s morning commute and blocking access to Chicago’s O’Hare airport – as they try to shake US support for Israel and draw attention to the humanitarian disaster in Gaza.The disruptions are raising questions about the limits of free speech and led a US senator to encourage people to “take matters in their own hands.”An activist in Bakersfield, California, blew through limits on free speech when, during a public comment period on a resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, she told city council members last week they would be murdered in their homes. She now faces felony charges.<h2>Why was a valedictorian’s speech removed from USC’s ceremony?</h2>Separately, on Monday, the University of Southern California canceled the commencement speech of its valedictorian – biomedical engineering major Asna Tabassum, who is Muslim – after her social media posts were targeted by pro-Israel activists, raising questions about the existence of free speech.“Tradition must give way to safety,” USC Provost Andrew Guzman wrote in an online, campuswide letter announcing his decision to axe Tabassum’s speech. The rest of the ceremony on May 10, including the planned commencement address of the Hollywood director Jon Chu, famous for the blockbuster film “Crazy Rich Asians” and who is being awarded an honorary degree, will apparently proceed.It is not clear what Tabassum planned to say in her speech, and she would not go into details during an interview on Tuesday with CNN’s Nick Watt. She disputed the cancellation had to with security and said USC’s decision to cancel the remarks “impedes on my freedom of expression.”Tabassum’s resume, as described in the early April release announcing her selection as valedictorian, is objectively incredible and pointed to her volunteer work sending medical supplies to foreign countries and volunteering with the homeless on Skid Row in Los Angeles.In a statement after the cancellation of her speech, she noted that her minor is in “resistance to genocide,” a horror she said can be driven by hate and fear. “And due to widespread fear,” Tabassum wrote, “I was hoping to use my commencement speech to inspire my classmates with a message of hope.”In between the time when Tabassum’s valedictorian application was selected by Guzman and his cancellation of her speech, her social media activity was attacked by pro-Israel activists. In her Instagram profile, she links to a website that calls for the abolishment of the state of Israel.The content of the commencement speech was not mentioned in Guzman’s letter announcing the cancellation, and he argued it was not about speech but about security.“The intensity of feelings, fueled by both social media and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, has grown to include many voices outside of USC and has escalated to the point of creating substantial risks relating to security and disruption at commencement,” Guzman wrote, noting 65,000 people are expected to attend the ceremony.While Tabassum will not get the chance to speak at USC, and it remains to be seen if there will be any kind of protest to disrupt the commencement ceremony, there’s a growing frustration expressed by lawmakers and presumably by Bay Area commuters with protesters adopting an in-your-face strategy.<h2>Senator wants people to ‘take matters in their own hands’ against protesters</h2>A Republican senator, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, encouraged people whose lives are disrupted by pro-Palestinian protests to go rogue.“I would encourage most people anywhere that get stuck behind criminals like this who are trying to block traffic to take matters in their own hands,” Cotton said on Fox News on Monday, intentionally referring to the protesters as “criminals.”This worldview is to be expected from Cotton, who wrote a controversial op-ed for The New York Times in 2020 calling on the government to call in the military to put down the occasionally violent protests sparked by the death of George Floyd.But the frustration extends across party lines. Sen. John Fetterman, the Pennsylvania Democrat, shared a video on X on Tuesday of a brief but loud protest at an Ann Arbor, Michigan, Starbucks, with the comment, “blocking a bridge or berating folks in Starbucks isn’t righteous, it just makes you an asshole.”<h2>Grabbing the mic</h2>Erwin Chemerinsky, the University of California, Berkeley’s law school dean, is a bona fide expert on the First Amendment who is also dealing with the real-world example of his wife – fellow Berkeley law professor Catherine Fisk – essentially taking Cotton’s advice to take matters literally into her own hands.A celebration Chemerinsky and Fisk hosted for third-year law students at their Oakland, California, home was interrupted when one of the celebrants, Malak Afaneh, who is co-president of Berkeley Law Students for Justice in Palestine, pulled her own microphone and amplifier out of a backpack and began loudly calling on the University of California system to divest from Israel.When Fisk tried to grab the microphone from Afaneh, the mixer turned into a social media moment.The added context is that before the mixer, posters had been hung around campus depicting Chemerinsky with a bloody knife and fork and referring to him as a Zionist.Chemerinsky explained his view of free speech to CNN’s Jake Tapper on “The Lead” last week:CHEMERINSKY: I found the image of me with a bloody knife and fork deeply offensive; it does raise the antisemitic trope of blood libel. But I also took the position that they had the right to put it out in bulletin boards around the school. Many students and staff, Jewish and non-Jewish, said that it made them feel unsafe. But I said under the First Amendment, they have the right to put those things on bulletin boards.But when something is happening at my house, that’s quite different. We invited the graduating students over at the request of the class president to celebrate their graduation. When a student took out of her backpack a microphone and an amplifier and began talking about what’s going on in the Middle East, that’s not OK in my home. No one was speaking that night. It wasn’t in any way an occasion for anything but socializing and celebration.<h2>More reports of bias</h2>Meanwhile, there are more and more reports of both anti-Muslim and antisemitic bias. Here are key lines from two separate CNN reports this month:The Council on American-Islamic Relations said “it received 8,061 complaints of anti-Muslim bias incidents last year – the highest number in the 28 years CAIR has tracked hate.” Read more about the group’s annual civil rights report.The Anti-Defamation League “tracked 8,873 antisemitic incidents in the United States in 2023 – the highest number of incidents reported since the organization began tracking data in 1979, according to the organization’s annual audit of antisemitism.” Read more about the ADL’s report.",2024-04-16 18:03:00,Deepening US divide over Israel tests the limits of free speech,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/16/politics/us-israel-free-speech-what-matters/index.html
Stephen Collinson,"There are two Donald Trump criminal trials now taking place.There’s the one in a Manhattan courtroom, where a judge, attorneys for both sides and prospective jurors are making strenuous efforts to lay the foundation of the fair trial to which the ex-president and every other citizen is entitled.And there’s the imaginary trial that exists in Trump’s rhetoric, led by “heartless thugs” and a “very conflicted judge” who is “rushing the trial” that the presumptive GOP nominee claims is a “Biden inspired witch-hunt.”In court on Tuesday, Trump made eye contact with potential jurors and was admonished by Judge Juan Merchan for muttering while one was questioned. But the surprisingly snappy pace of the process confounded initial expectations that putting on trial possibly the most famous man on Earth would be a laborious and prolonged process. While there were occasional moments of levity in the court and reminders that Trump’s status make him a defendant like none other, conversations that members of the jury pool had with the judge and defense lawyers and prosecutors hinted at the gravity of what will unfold in the coming weeks. One potential juror, for instance, noted: “This is real. This man’s life is on the line, the country’s on the line, this is serious.”As Trump’s hush money trial quickened on its second, compelling day — with seven jurors seated — Trump stepped up efforts to discredit the proceedings and the legal system itself. He bolstered the argument that is both his primary defense and his main campaign message — that he’s a persecuted victim being prosecuted because he’s on course to win back the White House in November. The former president’s strategy encapsulates one of the most consequential challenges to the American courts system in modern memory — one that is likely to leave it tarnished in the eyes of tens of millions of his supporters whatever the jury decides. And it exemplifies the unprecedented circumstances of the first former president going on trial in the middle of an election campaign that is now running more through multiple court rooms than swing states.But outside the courtroom, the former president raged, offering a skewed commentary on the good faith efforts inside.When the search for 12 jurors plus alternates paused for the day, Trump motorcaded to a bodega uptown, to highlight what he says is rising crime faced by the owners of small stores that are often open all night and especially serve immigrant communities. Trump was in his element, waving to a crowd that chanted “Four more years” and “We love Trump,” as he belted out quotes that dripped with falsehoods about foreign nations emptying their prisons and asylums to send a tide of migrants to American cities.In a rowdy event in which he looked more like a mayoral candidate than a presumptive presidential nominee, he made two points. First that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg should be going after ‘real’ criminals and not him, and that his obligation to attend the trial was keeping him off the campaign trail, as his rival, President Joe Biden, sweeps this week through swing-state Pennsylvania.“It’s Alvin Bragg’s fault, he goes after people like Trump, who did nothing wrong,” the former president said standing under a sign for an ATM, in a scene the long-time master self-publicist seemed to be offering up for a front page in the New York Post. “It makes me campaign locally and that’s OK,” Trump said, wrapping up his spot of street politicking in the city that made his name and that will send forth 12 jurors with his legal destiny, and potentially even his liberty, in their hands.For his part, Biden offered his first comments on Trump’s legal challenges since the trial proceedings began, saying in an interview with Nexstar, “His lack of ethics has nothing to do with me.”<h2>An unusual defendant faces the conventions of the court</h2>Trump is accused of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to Stormy Daniels, an adult film star who alleged she had an affair with Trump before he became president. Bragg’s theory of the case is that this alleged conduct resulted in Trump keeping vital information from voters ahead of the 2016 election. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies having a sexual relationship with Daniels. This is only one of four trials looming over Trump; the others focus on his attempts to overturn the 2020 election and his hoarding of classified documents.The current trial is not televised, meaning that Trump is deprived of a platform. But that restriction does allow him to mount a misleading daily commentary on what is taking place inside the courtroom that is likely to be the most that many viewers of conservative media learn about the case.In line with the four-day-a-week schedule for the trial, proceedings will halt on Wednesday. Trump is expected to have dinner with Polish President Andrzej Duda, a nationalist who was one of the ex-president’s favorite foreign leaders during his term. Criminal defendants don’t generally take a break from their trials to sup with visiting presidents. The visit will be another reminder of the extraordinary circumstances of an election entangled with Trump’s legal fate and may be seen as a highly symbolic endorsement by Duda of his friend during his hour of need.As the trial reaches its first break, two things are already becoming clear.First, the conventions of the criminal trial – like those in thousands of courtrooms every day – mean this case will grind on relentlessly. There’s little the former president can do to stop it, despite the pre-trial delaying tactics and complex litigation common to all his cases. This sense of order was reflected in the solid progress in seating jurors on Tuesday.“It is remarkable how normal it is in this situation,” Mimi Rocah, a former division chief at the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, told CNN’s Erin Burnett. “The criminal justice system, the jury system, is working the way it’s supposed to work.”The second major takeaway two days in is that Trump – who carved a public persona as a ruthless real estate shark, told victims “You’re fired” on “The Apprentice,” sees himself as a strongman president and has his own Boeing that can take him where he wants, when he wants – must cede total control when court is in session. He can’t act out and is being forced by a gag order not to attack witnesses or family members of officers of the court.When he was muttering in court on Tuesday, Merchan told the ex-president’s lawyer, “I will not have any jurors intimidated in the courtroom.” The incident was likely just a taste of clashes to come between Trump and the judge. In previous civil trials, Trump challenged the dignity of the rule of the court and feuded with other judges. The fact that his time is not his own is also highlighted by his complaints that he’s unable to attend a US Supreme Court hearing arising from his federal election interference trial next week. And he’s also complaining the judge won’t let him attend his son Barron’s high school graduation – even though Merchan is yet to rule on the issue.<h2>A swift jury selection process</h2>For anyone wondering whether a former Republican president who alienates his opponents could get a free trial in New York, Tuesday’s jury selection process might prove something of a relief. There is great debate among legal scholars and partisans on whether Bragg’s case is a legal stretch and whether Trump is guilty of the alleged conduct. But potential jurors appeared to take their obligation deeply seriously. It was notable that a large group admitted that they couldn’t honestly say they could judge Trump fairly – testimony to the extreme reactions that the former president evokes.“I don’t think I can be as impartial and unbiased as I thought I could be,” said one man who was excused.But other potential jurors said they’d be able to put any political feelings about Trump to one side and focus on the evidence and the law. “I feel that politically, we have big disagreements, your client and myself,” one person said. “There are certain things he’s said that I don’t care for. But lots of people say things I don’t care for.” She added: “But when I’m coming here, that can’t count, that has to go away.”In a sign of the times, the judge and lawyers spent hours combing through social media postings of potential jurors and family members, seeking evidence of bias. And in another revealing trend that hinted at the ex-president’s political appeal, some potential jurors mentioned that they viewed his rhetorical eruptions as those of someone who speaks his mind, unlike conventional politicians.When one potential juror asked Merchan if attendance at her sister’s wedding in September could be a reason not to serve, the judge sparked laughter in court by replying: “If we were still here in September that would be a big problem.”Jury consultant Robert Hirschhorn told CNN’s Burnett that Trump should be happy with the process so far. “It’s a mixed group, that’s exactly what you want.” He added: “The former president caught himself some pretty good jurors today.”Trump has asked the Supreme Court to agree with his expansive claim of presidential immunity in a bid to derail his trials. But so far, his hush money trial suggests that despite the former president’s undiluted craving for power, every American remains equal under the law.Courtroom artist Christine Cornell has sketched some of the most notorious defendants in modern history, including crime family boss John Gotti and financier Bernie Madoff, and has been drawing Trump for years. She conjured up Trump’s new reality best when she told CNN Tuesday: “It’s just another human being. He’s just a guy in a pinch.”",2024-04-17 09:23:00,A jury that will decide Trump’s fate begins to take shape as first criminal trial powers ahead,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/16/politics/donald-trump-trial-narrative-analysis/index.html
Stephen Collinson,"Israel and Iran have now thrust the Middle East into a dangerous new era by erasing the taboo against overt military strikes on one another’s territory.The question now is whether each side’s imperatives to demonstrate deterrence and to save face have been satisfied – or whether the enemies are destined to enter a new cycle of escalation that could make the crisis even more perilous.Most immediately, the ball is in Iran’s court after Israel conducted strikes near the city of Isfahan early Friday.Initial reports suggest that the action was limited and, according to US officials, did not target Iranian nuclear sites in the area. Instead, it may have been intended to demonstrate Israeli capacity to penetrate deep into Iran following Iran’s unprecedented missile and drone attack on Israel last weekend, which was largely thwarted.Still, the fact that Israel chose a target inside Iran rather than confining its response to Iranian proxies in Syria or Iraq, for instance, significantly ups the ante in the confrontation and raises the possibility that the showdown could quickly get out of control.The Israeli action last weekend that was largely repulsed by Israeli, US and allied defensive systems followed an Israeli strike on Iranian consular buildings in Damascus, Syria, that killed two senior Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps officers.With the latest twist of the crisis, Israel’s strikes appeared to be trying to thread a needle in demonstrating that it can evade Iranian defenses at will – and in the vicinity of Iranian nuclear facilities – while not creating a situation that would oblige Iran to respond with another escalation that could push the rivals toward all-out war.The risk in trying to navigate this narrow path is that the region is so on edge six months into Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza and the political tensions are so acute inside both countries that it is hard for each side to accurately assess exactly how the other might react.Hours before the Israeli strikes, for instance, Iran had warned that any Israeli attack would be met with a robust response. Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian told CNN that such action would be “immediate and at a maximum level.”Still, early indications were on Friday that Iran is prepared to end this particular phase of escalation without stepping up another rung on the confrontational ladder and that Israel – while rebuffing international calls for restraint – may still have taken US and Western concerns about the possibility of sparking a major regional war into account.Iranian official media and government officials were downplaying the attack on Friday. And a regional intelligence source with knowledge of Iran’s potential reaction to Friday’s strike said that direct state-to-state strikes between the two enemies were “over.” The source, who was not authorized to speak publicly, told CNN that, to his knowledge, Iran was not expected to respond to the strikes — but did not give a reason.If subsequent events bear this out, Israel may succeed in fulfilling a strategic maxim laid out by President John Kennedy in 1963 as he reflected upon the Cuban missile crisis the previous year when he said that statesmanship must aim to “avert those confrontations which bring an adversary to a choice of either a humiliating retreat or a nuclear war.” The danger was not a nuclear war in this case but a tit-for-tat climb into a major conventional conflict that could have consumed the entire region and killed many Iranians, Israelis and people in neighboring countries. As it stands, neither Iran nor Israel have been forced into a humiliating retreat – and that may be the key to containing the situation.<h2>Netanyahu defies Biden again</h2>Israel’s attack on Iran also represents a rebuff by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of President Joe Biden’s advice to treat the successful interception of nearly all the drones and missiles directed at Israel as a victory. The president had argued that the massive defensive operation proved Iran couldn’t pose a threat to Israel’s security and that further retaliation was not required.While there does seem to have been an effort by Israel to consider US and Western anxieties about a wider war, Netanyahu has repeatedly ignored Biden’s entreaties — including months of US complaints about the Israeli conduct of the war in Gaza and its toll on Palestinian civilians following the October 7 Hamas terror attacks. The president, though getting increasingly frustrated with Netanyahu, has not been willing to lay down red lines for the Israeli prime minister or to condition the use of US arms shipments in Gaza.But Biden also came up against the reality that Israel is a sovereign state, and while strongly reliant on the United States, was unlikely ever to allow a mass air attack directed at its territory to go unanswered. In the aftermath of latest developments, Washington is concentrating on a new effort to stop tensions from rising further while distancing itself from the Israeli action.“What we’re focused on, what the G7 is focused on, and again, it’s reflected in our statement and in our conversation, is our work to de-escalate tensions,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a conference of foreign ministers from industrialized nations in Italy.The White House did make clear in recent days that it would not join any Israeli offensive actions against Iran. But US military forces will almost certainly be called upon to defend Israel again in the event of a major Iranian retaliation. Biden thus could get dragged ever deeper into a military conflict in the region that he has repeatedly tried and failed to stop. The political consequences would be grave for the president in November as presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump warns the world is spinning out of control on his watch. Biden has already paid a heavy price among progressive, young and Arab American voters over his support for Israel, which could have serious implications for his performance in swing states that will decide the presidential election. And any spike in oil prices caused by uncertainty in the Middle East ahead of the election could push up the cost of gasoline and exact a painful political price on the president.<h2>A chilling geopolitical picture emerges</h2>Israel, for all its military prowess, is in a deeply vulnerable position. It is now effectively fighting on three fronts — against Hamas in Gaza; another Iranian proxy, Hezbollah, in a simmering conflict over the Lebanon border; and directly against Iran itself.The threat from Hezbollah is especially acute since the radical group has tens of thousands of missiles that could cause carnage in Israeli cities far greater than the threat posed by Hamas rockets at the start of the Gaza war. A full-scale entry by Hezbollah into the conflict to support Iran would be certain to trigger a massive Israeli response. That would bring war back to Lebanon, a nation already cursed by a desperate modern history and home to the Iran-backed militia.Events of the last few days mean that even if the region doesn’t tip into a large-scale war immediately, previous assumptions that Iran would never openly attack Israel and Israel would not strike at Iranian soil have been shattered.“Even if you get through this phase without a major Iranian retaliation, the reality is that Israel and Iran are going to be locked in this competitive struggle,” Aaron David Miller, a veteran Middle East peace negotiator for Republicans and Democratic presidents, told CNN. “There is no solution to the problem of Iranian proxies. There’s no solution to the fact that Iran is a nuclear weapons threshold state. And this relationship is going to be hanging over the region and perhaps the international community like some sword of Damocles.”Israel faced intense pressure to show restraint not just from the United States but also from European and Arab powers, several of which joined the US and Israeli operation to shoot down Iran’s drones and missiles last weekend. While US support for Israel is assured, the reaction of those other countries will be critical now that Netanyahu decided to ignore advice from Israel’s defenders. One argument for Israel not retaliating against Iran had been that it could benefit from a wave of sympathy and support and begin to repair ties with allies that fervently criticized its conduct of the war in Gaza. That opportunity might already have been squandered.Israel, however, regards itself as locked in an existential battle with Iran, one that played out until now in covert and cyber-attacks on its nuclear program, scientists and military and intelligence infrastructure. History shows that when Israeli leaders feel their country’s survival is threatened, they often act unilaterally even when the United States counsels restraint. Such a doctrine led to previous Israeli attacks on nuclear facilities in Iraq and Syria.By striking back at Israel after the Damascus attack, Iran was making an implicit statement that Israel could not escape paying a price for such attacks anymore and that they’d be met by a direct response.For Israel’s war cabinet, which mulled for days its response to the airborne Iranian barrage, the idea that Iran enjoyed the advantage in their geopolitical game of chicken would have been untenable.Malcolm Davis, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, told CNN’s Michael Holmes that the latest actions did set the stage for a long-term escalatory cycle that generates from instability in the region. But the apparent Israeli capacity to elude Iran’s air defenses may also reestablish Israel’s strategic edge. “I do think it sends a message to Tehran that really they are more vulnerable to Israeli strikes than they would like to admit,” Davis said.Some experts worry that the new reality of direct exchanges with Israel may prompt Iran – which is estimated by experts to be only weeks away from being able to produce its own nuclear weapon – to rush across the nuclear threshold. That would be a situation that neither Israel – nor probably the United States – could accept, so the rising danger of recent days may only be a taste of what is to come.",2024-04-19 12:13:00,Israeli and Iranian strikes transform Middle East geopolitics,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/19/politics/israel-iran-strike-analysis/index.html
Kylie Atwood,"US Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell met with Niger’s Prime Minister Ali Lamine Zeine on Friday and they agreed – after Niger’s demands – that the US would militarily withdraw from the country, according to a State Department official.In the coming days, there will be conversations over the timeline for the withdrawal with the Department of Defense, the official said.The major drawdown will significantly impact the US troop presence on the continent of Africa, and the move comes amid serious US concerns about the country’s deepening relationships with Russia and Iran. The New York Times first reported on the expected withdrawal.Campbell’s meeting with Zeine was their second this week, while he was in Washington, DC, for the World Bank’s spring meetings.Just last month, Niger said it was revoking its military cooperation deal with the US, and these conversations followed what have been contentious interactions between officials from the two countries in recent months. Last summer the US troops stationed in Niger became inactive after a military coup that pushed out the democratically elected president, Mohamed Bazoum, and installed the military junta.Throughout the conversation with Campbell this week, Zeine stressed a desire for partnership with the US to continue and made an effort to differentiate this situation from that of the French, the State Department official said. Still, it appears that both countries will be militarily forced out of the country within a year of one another. The US will maintain a diplomatic presence in the country, the official said.Earlier this week in Niger, a senior airman filed a formal whistleblower complaint, warning that the US ambassador to Niger and the defense attache had “intentionally suppressed intelligence” in an attempt to “maintain a façade of a great country-to-country relationship.”And US forces on the continent faced another blow last week when Chadian officials threatened to cancel the Status of Forces Agreement, or SOFA, which determines the rules and conditions under which US military personnel can operate in the country. While the letter did not directly order the US military to leave Chad, officials told CNN that it said all US forces would have to leave a French base in N’Djamena.",2024-04-19 21:45:00,"US troops set to withdraw from Niger, State Department official says",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/19/politics/us-troops-to-withdraw-from-niger/index.html
"Melanie Zanona,Annie Grayer,Manu Raju,Shania Shelton","Rep. Paul Gosar on Friday signed on to the effort to remove Speaker Mike Johnson from his job, the Arizona Republican announced in a news release, becoming the third member to do so.Gosar huddled on the House floor earlier in the day with GOP Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie, the other two co-sponsors of the motion to vacate the speakership.They have not taken steps to force a floor vote on the resolution. The House adjourned for the rest of the day on Friday afternoon, meaning the earliest Greene could move to oust Johnson is Saturday.If Greene takes that consequential step, the House will have to consider it within two legislative days. This means leadership could wait to handle it on the floor after the weeklong recess if they so choose. A floor vote to oust Johnson would require a majority to succeed.Conservative lawmakers, who are unhappy with the speaker over his proposed foreign aid bills among other priorities, have attacked the speaker for relying on Democrats to advance the bills.Rep. Chip Roy, a key hardliner who sits on the House Rules Committee, accused Johnson of giving away Republicans’ leverage on border security. However, he would not say if he would support ousting the speaker.“I’m not getting into that right now,” he said, but when pressed on whether moving to oust the speaker would hurt the House GOP conference, he replied, “I mean, it’s bad for our party not to lead,” and lamented the GOP’s inaction on border security.Other GOP hardliners were also seething on Friday.“It’s tough to defend him right now. You know, and that’s hard to say, but it’s just a reality,” said Rep. Eli Crane.The Arizona Republican, who voted to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall, didn’t rule out supporting efforts to remove Johnson.“My position is that I’m open, and I’m not going to tell you guys what I’m going to do. We’ll see if that materializes, we’ll see if the trigger is pulled on this. That won’t be up to me, but I’m definitely frustrated like a lot of the conference and like a lot of the American people,” he said.“He knows how frustrated I am. I do it as respectfully as I can, but I’m not going to pull punches because at the end of the day this is so much bigger than me or the motion to vacate or Speaker Mike Johnson,” Crane added. “To me, this comes down to, ‘Are we going to try to save this country, or are we just going to continue on with the Washington uniparty that continuously sells out the American people?’”Rep. Dan Bishop targeted his ire at the House GOP Conference’s leadership as a whole, calling their actions “pathetic.”“My purpose is not really criticism of the speaker, per se, it’s the whole – it’s the power sources within the Republican Conference and the way – and the speaker, unfortunately, has acceded to it – but it’s the way that they never prioritize center-right Americans’ priorities. Never. And that’s where we’ve ended up again, and I think it’s pathetic,” he said.Bishop was clear that he is not supporting removing Johnson from the speakership – for now. “I don’t see any particular advantage in solving the problem I just described by moving against the speaker at this time,” said the North Carolina Republican.Gosar’s move comes as Johnson has faced growing threats to his speakership for his handling of legislation to send foreign aid to Ukraine and Israel.That threat reached its highest point yet on Thursday after CNN and other outlets reported that Johnson was being lobbied by his members to raise the threshold required to trigger the procedure to oust the speaker – a move that would help ensure the Louisiana Republican can pass foreign aid bills and still keep his job without needing to rely on Democrats to bail him out.The speaker was surrounded on the House floor on Thursday by a number of far-right lawmakers in a heated discussion. The group implored Johnson to give them assurances that he would not raise the threshold on the motion to vacate, but the speaker would not commit, leaving many of the lawmakers fuming and some even saying this was a red line that could propel the motion to oust him forward.After that pressure, Johnson said later in the day that he will not change the procedure for removing him from the speakership.Prominent conservative lawmakers echoed Bishop in refusing to back removing Johnson from the speakership until at least the election in November.House Freedom Caucus Chairman Bob Good told CNN’s Manu Raju that Johnson “has failed us,” and sharply criticized his handling of the foreign aid bills, though he added that he is opposed to ousting Johnson ahead of November.“I don’t defend the performance of the speaker, I don’t defend the actions that have been taken, including today, I think this is a terrible mistake. However, that doesn’t mean that I support what I would consider to be not the most prudent action right now. We’re 6 months before an election, we’ve got a two or three vote margin. There’s a far greater degree of uncertainty in that situation than there was back in September,” he said.Rep. Ralph Norman, another Republican hardliner, agreed that they should leave Johnson in place through the election, and said he hopes Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene holds off on her effort to oust the speaker.“We’ve got seven months until an election. We’ll have a new president, hopefully, and then we’ll see how the speaker race comes out. And to be honest, I don’t know if Mike, after all this – he’s going through a lot, he’s doing in his mind what he thinks is best. I will not criticize them. I disagree with him, I’m not going to criticize him,” said Norman.This story has been updated with additional developments and reporting.",2024-04-19 14:40:00,Gosar becomes third House GOP member to back effort to oust Johnson from speakership,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/19/politics/paul-gosar-mike-johnson-house-gop/index.html
George Ramsay,"Simone Biles has revealed that she thought “the world is going to hate me” after withdrawing from the gymnastics team event at the Tokyo Olympics.In an interview with the Call Her Daddy podcast released on Wednesday, Biles spoke about how she was affected by “the twisties” during the Games, which causes a gymnast to lose track of where their body is and how it moves through the air.The four-time Olympic gold medalist was replaced by Jordan Chiles in the team event and later explained that she needed to prioritize her mental health.“If I could have got on a plane and flown home, I would have done it,” Biles said. “As soon as I landed (the vault), I was like, ‘America hates me, the world is going to hate me, and I can only see what they’re saying on Twitter right now.’“That was my first thought … I thought I was going to be banned from America. Because that’s what they tell you, ‘Don’t come back if it’s not gold. Gold or bust – don’t come back.’”Biles went on to win bronze in the balance beam in Tokyo but took an extended break from gymnastics after the Games.She returned to the sport last year and became the most decorated male or female gymnast ever when she passed Belarusian Vitaly Scherbo’s record of 33 overall medals across the Olympics and the world championships.During last year’s world championships, Biles won four gold medals – in the team, all-around, beam and floor competitions – as well as a silver in the vault.The 27-year-old could add to her medal haul at this year’s Olympics in Paris, which begin on July 26.Speaking on Call Her Daddy, she elaborated on what the twisties feel like, comparing it to the yips in golf or baseball. In gymnastics, however, the phenomenon is potentially more dangerous if it causes an athlete to land dangerously.“It’s like your mind and your body is at a disconnect,” said Biles.“Your body is going to try to do something, and your mind is like, ‘No, you’re not doing this, you’re going to open out, you’re going to do this’ … You’ve been doing something for so long and you now no longer have control.”CNN’s Issy Ronald contributed to reporting.",2024-04-17 08:05:00,Simone Biles thought ‘the world is going to hate me’ after experiencing the twisties at the Tokyo Olympics,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/17/sport/simone-biles-twisties-tokyo-olympics-spt-intl/index.html
"Alex Marquardt,Katie Bo Lillis","Hours before Israel launched a drone strike against Iran on Thursday night, Israeli officials gave a heads up to their US counterparts in Washington: an attack was in the works, they said, and without sharing specifics, indicated it would be carried out in the next several days, according to a senior US official.It was exactly the message the Biden administration had hoped they wouldn’t receive. Throughout the week, US officials had urged Israel not to retaliate for Iran’s unprecedented attack five days prior, when hundreds of missiles and drones were fired from inside Iran at Israel.US officials worried that any Israeli counter-strike could trigger an escalating cycle of direct action between the two nations that could spiral out of control.“We didn’t endorse [Israel’s] response,” the senior official said, referencing the heads up the US received before Israel’s Thursday strike.The back-and-forth attacks of the past week have left US officials concerned that a barrier that once existed between Israel and Iran has now been breached, leading to a new form of direct confrontation that could be infinitely more volatile and difficult to predict.How Iran responds will now be a crucial test of whether the two nations have entered the opening stages of direct conflict — or whether both sides can step back from the brink.There are some signs that the situation may be defusing.US intelligence has long assessed that neither Iran nor Israel has any appetite for an outright war. Israel’s retaliatory strike appears to have been designed to be limited, striking a single military base about 275 miles from Tehran and leaving untouched two nearby facilities that are an important part of Iran’s nuclear development program.A regional intelligence source with knowledge of Iran’s reaction to the attack told CNN that the direct state to state strikes between the two countries were “over.” Iran, this person said, was not expected to respond.“No indications of further escalation at the moment,” the senior US official said, warning that things could change. “But all indicators suggest stepping back.”Still, US officials are keenly aware that after the unprecedented exchange of direct fire, it may be harder than ever to predict how Iran will respond to perceived provocations.Iran’s massive attack on Israel last week marked the first time it had fired from within its own borders directly at Israel, upending years of comfortable assumptions by the US and its allies about the limits of Iranian militancy and its willingness to attack Israel directly.Iranian officials have stated publicly that Iran’s policy toward Israel has changed.“We have decided to create a new equation, and that is if from now on the Zionist regime attacks our interests, assets, personalities, and citizens, at any point we will attack against them from the Islamic Republic of Iran,” Hossein Salami, the top commander of Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, told Iranian state TV following last weekend’s attack.And just hours before Israel’s counterstrike Thursday night, Iran’s foreign minister told CNN’s Erin Burnett that if Israel retaliated, “the next response from us will be immediate and at a maximum level.”“I have rarely seen a moment [in the Middle East] more combustible than it is today,” CIA Director Bill Burns said at the George W. Bush Presidential Center in Dallas on Thursday.<h2>A long-simmering shadow war</h2>For some former US officials deeply familiar with the Iranian regime, Iran’s unprecedented direct attack last weekend makes sense given its failure to compete with Israel in a long-simmering shadow war that has left a number of its commanders dead.Israel has carried out numerous successful strikes against Iranian military leaders across the region, and even some officials inside Iran’s own borders. Then, on April 1, an Israeli strike on what Iran claims was an embassy in Syria killed seven officials, including two senior Iranian commanders.“Imagine the pressure building up in the [Iranian] system,” said retired Gen. Frank McKenzie, the former commander of US Central Command. “‘Israel kills our people and doesn’t pay a price?’ I think that is a significant driver.”McKenzie and other analysts suggested that to Iran, the April 1 attack in Syria was an escalation on top of an already untenable situation that its leaders felt demanded a stronger-than-usual response to deter future Israeli action.One of the commanders who was killed, Mohammed Reza Zahedi, was the connective tissue between Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah, Iran’s largest and most capable proxy, according to Jonathan Panikoff, a former senior intelligence analyst who specializes in the region. Zahedi, he said, “was not a small kill.”Leading up to Iran’s missile and drone barrage against Israel, US officials still believed Iran was likely to respond through its network of proxy fighters, as it had always done before. But as the US and its allies began to see signs that Iran was moving missiles within its own territory, it sparked a frantic rethinking across Washington about what Iran was likely to do, current and former American officials said.It remains to be seen whether this shift in Iran’s posture reflects a more permanent change in the thinking of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei.“It’s not clear whether Khamenei, at age 84, has changed his longtime strategic doctrine to avoid direct confrontation with Israel, or whether this is a preview of how a post-Khamenei, military-led Iranian government may conduct itself,” said Karim Sadjadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowmernt for International Peace.Perhaps the best parallel for the current situation is what happened after the US strike that killed top Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani in January 2020. Within days, Iran— not one of its proxies— fired dozens of short-range ballistic missiles at American troops  on a US military base in Iraq.  That, too, was considered an unprecedented step that risked igniting a new and more dangerous regional paradigm.In that instance, Iran signaled enough of its intentions that US troops were able to shelter in bunkers to minimize casualties. No Americans were killed — although dozens suffered traumatic brain injuries — and when the attack had finished, Iran messaged publicly that it considered the matter closed. The US under then-President Donald Trump chose not to retaliate further.<h2>Assessing the true impact of Iran’s attack</h2>In the days following the attack on Israel, some analysts suggested that Iran may have deliberately sought to avoid casualties in an effort to keep the situation from escalating; Pentagon officials stridently rejected that hypothesis.On Saturday, Israel and its allies were able to destroy 99 percent of the Iranian projectiles before they impacted. There was little damage in Israel, and no deaths. That, combined with public and diplomatic signaling by Iran in the days leading up to the attack, has caused similar theories about Iran’s intent to circulate Washington this week.But administration officials — as well as McKenzie and other former officials — have denied the suggestion that Iran was pulling its punches this time, either. The sheer scale of the assault itself suggests that Iran intended to kill Israelis, officials and analysts said. In many ways, Saturday was a triumph of years of military planning done in preparation for precisely this kind of hypothetical assault.But air defense against such a vast array of threats is a complex and difficult operation, and although Israel and its allies were successful, that success was in no way a foregone conclusion, current and former officials say.“The Iranians used the crown jewels,” McKenzie said. “Their ballistic missiles, drones, and land attack cruise missiles. And what they launched was a maximum effort, about as much as they could do. This was not signaling.”Now, Washington and the region await Iran’s response to the Israeli counterstrike.The risk, officials say, is profound.“Israel and Iran are going to be starting higher on the escalatory ladder for every future moment of conflict and that is incredibly dangerous,” said Panikoff. “If Israel and Iran have a greater threat perception of each other, they’re more likely to think they have to act in a more robust and aggressive way.”",2024-04-19 19:22:00,Washington wrestles with ‘new equation’ of direct attacks between Iran and Israel,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/19/politics/washington-wrestles-with-new-equation-of-direct-attacks-between-iran-and-israel/index.html
Ben Morse,"The NBA has banned Toronto Raptors player Jontay Porter from the league after an investigation found that the 24-year-old had violated betting rules, the league said.The league announced in March it had opened an investigation into anomalies involving bets pertaining to Porter after unusual betting patterns around the player emerged.The NBA said its investigation found that Porter had “violated league rules by disclosing confidential information to sports bettors, limiting his own participation in one or more games for betting purposes, and betting on NBA games.”“There is nothing more important than protecting the integrity of NBA competition for our fans, our teams and everyone associated with our sport, which is why Jontay Porter’s blatant violations of our gaming rules are being met with the most severe punishment,” NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement.“While legal sports betting creates transparency that helps identify suspicious or abnormal activity, this matter also raises important issues about the sufficiency of the regulatory framework currently in place, including the types of bets offered on our games and players,” added Silver.“Working closely with all relevant stakeholders across the industry, we will continue to work diligently to safeguard our league and game.”The NBA said in a news release that the league has shared and will continue to share information with federal prosecutors. The league also said its investigation remains open and may result in further findings.The Raptors are “fully supportive of the league’s decision” and the team will continue to cooperate with the ongoing investigations, the team said in a release.CNN has sought comment from Porter’s representation.<h2>$80,000 bet frozen</h2>The investigation found that Porter informed someone who he knew to be an NBA bettor about his health status – which is confidential information – before a game on March 20.Subsequently, another person associated with Porter placed a $80,000 bet on the Raptors player underperforming in that game, which would have won $1.1 million.The $80,000 bet on the March 20 game was frozen due to the “unusual betting activity and actions of the player,” the NBA said.The NBA also found that Porter affected his own participation in games to influence bets on his performance in Toronto games.Additionally, the league also found that Porter placed at least 13 bets on NBA games between January and March this year.The bets totaled $54,094, ranging from $15 to $22,000, with the total payout being $76,059, resulting in net winnings of $21,965.While Porter was not involved in any of the games in which he bet on, there was a series of bets on a Raptors game in which he predicted that Toronto would lose. All three bets were unsuccessful.In 26 games this season with the Raptors, Porter averaged almost 14 minutes and just over four points per game.This story has been updated with additional information.",2024-04-17 18:32:00,NBA bans Toronto Raptors’ Jontay Porter for violating league’s gambling rules,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/17/sport/jontay-porter-banned-nba-gaming-rules-raptors-spt-intl/index.html
Amy Woodyatt,"At 23, only a few years into her professional surfing career, Becca Speak was sponsored by brands including Billabong, entering competitions and performing at the top of her game. She was enjoying her life and had lots to look forward to.But in an instant, she says, the sport that had given her life so much meaning “took so much away from me” when she sustained a serious head injury during a surf competition and was left unable to speak.“As soon as I hit my head, I went paralyzed for a moment,” Speak told CNN Sport of the accident, which took place in a concrete wave pool.“I didn’t really know what was happening. I just knew I couldn’t move my body, and I remember just being under the water, like, just crying, ‘please, please, please’ … not quite sure what’s happening, but I just knew I couldn’t move, and it was really scary.”Dragged from the water by friends who were watching her compete, Speak wasn’t sure whether something was seriously wrong but went to the hospital as the injury had left her bleeding. On the way, she started to experience delays with her speech.“It felt like the connection from my brain to my mouth wasn’t quite there,” she adds, but she returned home after hospital scans showed that “everything looked okay structurally.”But over the course of the few days, Speak says, she felt a little bit worse.“Eventually I felt like I was falling into a vegetative state, almost. I could barely put a couple words together. I was very overstimulated by the smallest things, just the sound of someone talking or the light from my phone or outside. Everything was just really overwhelming.”After a second trip to hospital, doctors confirmed that Speak had sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI), her sixth after a lifetime of enjoying sports including gymnastics, skiing, snowboarding, skateboarding and swimming.What followed was a grueling months-long recovery consisting of physical and cognitive therapy, a journey that is chronicled in the new film “Beyond Normal.”It took the surfer some three months to regain her normal speech patterns and even longer before she felt physically and mentally well again, thanks to neurological treatments, hyperbaric oxygen therapy and transcranial magnetic stimulation, and physical rehabilitation.“Most of the time, people tell you, ‘Oh, you’re fine. Shake it off,’ because brain injuries are an invisible injury they can’t really see or no one can see what’s happening, you know, on the inside, because you look fine from the outside,” explains Speak.<h2>A lifelong journey</h2>“I think this is a comeback story that maybe has been told a few times before, but I would think one of the unique parts of Becca’s story is how she’s explored all of these new evolving technologies that exist that didn’t exist five, 10 years ago,” director and filmmaker Jordyn Romero tells CNN.Romero has her own experience with head injuries, after sustaining a TBI snowboarding while she was in high school.“I don’t remember a whole week of my life. It was a pretty serious brain injury,” she told CNN Sport.However, she returned to cross-country training just a week later, thinking she had healed – and still feels some of the effects today.Romero and co-director Anna Wilder Burns wanted to use Speak’s story to raise awareness of the impact of brain injuries.Burns, who was a gymnast turned diver in college, says her understanding of concussions as an athlete growing up was similar to a lot of coaches, which is: you can’t see it, so it doesn’t feel as real as something like a broken ankle.“I had a teammate who had a really long concussion recovery, and I remember being kind of confused, like, ‘why is it taking so long? It’s a concussion,’ ” Burns adds.A concussion happens after a “bump, blow, or jolt to the head” or “a hit to the body that causes the head and brain to move quickly back and forth,” according to guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Any of these sudden movements can cause “the brain to bounce around or twist in the skull,” “chemical changes in the brain” and/or the “stretching and damaging” of brain cells, the CDC says.These changes can lead to symptoms, such as feeling dizzy or disoriented in the moment, or longer-lasting issues with sleep, memory, learning and even personality changes.Additionally, experts warn that subconcussive head impacts – repetitive hits to the head and body that do not cause symptoms – can still result in long-term neurological disease.The filmmakers credit a close and trusting relationship with Speak as key to allowing them to make an “intimate and vulnerable” film about her recovery, which took over two years to film.Throughout her treatment, Speak realized she had been living with the effects of her untreated head injuries for most of her adult life.While trying to get back to “normal,” she says, she realized she didn’t even know what that would mean, given the effect of her previous injuries.“A doctor one day said, ‘you have to get beyond what you think is normal.’ And that sort of became a mantra for me throughout the healing journey,” she explains.“This is just going to be a sort of lifelong journey for me, I think, and I’ve accepted that, and I’m OK with it,” Speak adds.The surfer says she has found a way to immerse herself in surfing once more, a sport that she “fell in love with” because “it was so free: it’s just you and Mother Nature.”Her accident almost changed that, she tells CNN, admitting that for a year, “I didn’t know if I ever even wanted to surf again.”“I had a lot of resentment towards surfing, because it took so much away from me.”However, she eventually got to thinking she might try it again – even if it was scary. Now, Speak once again surfs every day but now wears a foam helmet.“It’s like the next chapter of my life, and my goals are bigger than ever. Some days are still harder than others, and I’m trying to find that balance of pushing myself but also taking the time to rest and recover so I can accomplish all the things I want to do,” she adds.",2024-04-10 13:19:00,"A surfing injury left her unable to talk.

"George Ramsay,Amanda Davies,Aleks Klosok","Few athletes can claim to be as dominant in their discipline as Mondo Duplantis, the pole vault star who has broken the world record a staggering seven times.His latest record of 6.23 meters, achieved at last year’s world championships, is seven centimeters higher than anyone else has managed in the history of the sport, a testament to his supremacy in the pole vault over the past four years.Duplantis’ medal haul is also impressive, boasting an Olympic gold and four world championship titles – two indoor and two outdoor – with his sights set on further Olympic success in Paris later this year.And as for world records, Duplantis promises that he’s not done yet.“I think in the near future, I hope to just raise it up as little as I can because I think that’s all I need to do for a world record,” he tells CNN Sport’s Amanda Davies. “I know that I can jump higher. I know that I have higher heights in me.“I know what I need to do to get into those 6.30-type marks … I want to be dominant in the sport because I know that’s what I’m capable of, trying to win every competition and get the most out of myself at every meet that I’m at.“If I’m able to jump high, jump a world record, then that’s just a cherry on top.”Sporting pedigree runs in the Duplantis family: his father was a former top pole vaulter and his mother a heptathlete who competed for Sweden.He has been pole vaulting for almost as long as he could walk, taking his first steps in the sport as a three-year-old in his parents’ backyard in Lafayette, Louisiana, where a runway, bar and crash mat were installed for him and his siblings to use.While most athletes would take up the sport in their teenage years, it has been a lifelong affair for Duplantis, his childhood hobby gradually morphing into a successful career.He will never tire, he explains, of the feeling of climbing into the air, bending his body over a bar and falling back down to earth.“It’s special, and I think that it’s so hard to compare to most things,” he says. “But when you get it right, it’s like you’re kind of doing this little dance with the pole.“It happens fast. I feel like when I’m on my game and I’m dialed in and everything’s in the place where it needs to be then it’s super cool. It’s like riding a wave.”One of the more technical events in track and field, pole vault requires a unique blend of speed, strength and flexibility, though the mental aspect, says Duplantis, is just as important as the physical demands.“You have to be a little bit – or quite a bit – crazy to be able to dare to pole vault because it is a little bit of a freaky sport, in a way,” he explains.“You have to have the guts to be able to push yourself, and you’re going to be uncomfortable a lot of the time when you’re going up to stiffer poles, longer poles, trying new heights, new barriers all the time.”Born and raised in Louisiana, Duplantis has dual Swedish and American citizenship but competes for his mother’s native country on the international circuit.He is the strong favorite to defend his gold medal at the Paris Olympics, which officially begin on July 26, but had to work hard to win a second indoor world title last month after failing twice at 5.85m – a height he would usually expect to clear with ease.In the end, he managed to record a world-leading 6.05m, 15 centimeters higher than American Sam Kendricks in second and 20 clear of Greece’s Emmanouil Karalis in third.Duplantis later admitted that it was the hardest he had ever had to work in a competition, though he will be hoping that his events are more smooth-sailing as he embarks on the outdoor season with the Olympics looming.But when things don’t go as planned, Duplantis would do well to remind himself of his long history with the pole vault, even though the stakes are now higher and the audiences are much bigger than when he first took up the sport.“It’s still the same old pole vault,” he says. “The same event I’ve been doing since I was just a tiny little kid jumping in my backyard. I’m getting better as the year goes on which is a really cool thing. I’m definitely living my dream.”",2024-04-11 04:32:00,Mondo Duplantis aims for ‘dominance’ in ‘freaky sport’ of pole vault after breaking the world record multiple times,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/11/sport/mondo-duplantis-pole-vault-paris-olympics-spt-intl/index.html
Kevin Dotson,"USA Basketball unveiled the player roster Wednesday for the men’s team that will compete in the 2024 Paris Olympics.Three years after the Tokyo Olympics saw several of top US players sit out the Games in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2024 edition of the “Dream Team” will once again feature a roster loaded with future hall of famers and many of basketball’s brightest young stars.The team will be anchored by Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James, making his fourth appearance after skipping the past two Olympics.The 39-year-old James has previously brought home two gold medals (2008, 2012) and a bronze (2004).James will be joined by his Lakers teammate Anthony Davis, the Golden State Warriors’ Stephen Curry, the Phoenix Suns’ Kevin Durant and Devin Booker, the Boston Celtics’ Jayson Tatum and Jrue Holiday, Anthony Edwards of the Minnesota Timberwolves, the Los Angeles Clippers’ Kawhi Leonard, Tyrese Haliburton of the Indiana Pacers and the Miami Heat’s Bam Adebayo.This will be the 36-year-old Curry’s first Olympic Games, making him the fifth player to represent the Warriors at an Olympics with Team USA.The squad will also feature Philadelphia 76ers’ big man and reigning NBA MVP Joel Embiid, who has decided to make his Olympic debut competing for the US.Embiid could have chosen to play for his native Cameroon or France.The team’s head coach will be Golden State’s Steve Kerr, who takes over the role from Gregg Popovich, who led Team USA to gold in the Tokyo Games.The US team will hold a training camp and exhibition games in Las Vegas in July, before traveling to Paris.The Opening Ceremony for the 2024 Paris Olympics will take place on July 26 with men’s basketball play beginning the following day.",2024-04-17 08:58:00,LeBron James headlines Team USA’s 2024 Paris Olympics men’s basketball squad,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/17/sport/lebron-james-headlines-usa-2024-paris-olympics-mens-basketball-squad-spt-intl/index.html
Ben Church,"Jason Kelce is continuing to do Jason Kelce things even after retiring from the NFL.In the latest episode of the ‘New Heights’ podcast, which he does with his brother Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, the legendary center revealed that he recently lost his Super Bowl LII ring in the most unlikely way possible: in a pool of chili.It occurred at the recent Great “Lombaby Games,” a live show hosted by the brothers which sees teams compete in ridiculous games. One challenge saw participants wade through pools of Skyline chili, searching for replica Super Bowl rings tied to socks.Crucially, though, one of those ‘replicas’ was actually Kelce’s genuine ring, which he won with the Philadelphia Eagles in 2018.“I legitimately lost my Super Bowl ring in this event, they could not find it,” Jason said, with his brother Travis less than impressed.“We have still yet to find it. All of this stuff has been thrown away, so I think we can safely assume that my Super Bowl ring is now in a landfill someplace in the Cincinnati tri-state area. I didn’t think that would happen.”Jason said people had searched through the pools after the event, but that no one could salvage it from the three-way mess of chili, spaghetti and cheese.A metal detector was also used, but to no avail.“The only thing I can think of is, at some point, the sock got kicked out of the three-way and it made its way out of the pool and it was thrown away in some shape or form,” he continued.“The Super Bowl ring is officially gone. We’ve already put the insurance claim in, which I think the insurance company might have some things to say about whether they’re going to cover that.”Travis had little sympathy for his older brother, calling him an “imbecile” for willingly putting such a precious item into a large tub of chili.The exact cost of each a ring is generally kept secret and can vary wildly depending on specifications and size.New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft’s Super Bowl LI championship ring was auctioned off for just over $1 million in 2020, while the auction record for a ring once owned by a player is $230,401.A New England Patriots Super Bowl LI ring which had the name “Brady” on it – because it was made for a family member of quarterback Tom Brady – also fetched $344,927.“So ridiculous. Kids, if you’re watching at home, don’t do what Jason is doing,” Travis said, laughing as he listened to his brother try defend himself.Earlier this year, Jason announced he was retiring from the NFL in an emotional press conference.He had spent his entire 13-season NFL career with the Eagles, including the team’s 2018 Super Bowl win.With such memories locked away in his head forever, the seven-time Pro Bowler didn’t seem too bothered by losing the ring.“It’s just a hunk of metal. I’ll just have another one made, I think,” he added. “They can do that, right? Guess we’re gonna find out.”",2024-04-18 16:46:00,Jason Kelce says he’s lost his Super Bowl LII ring… in a pool filled with chili,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/18/sport/jason-kelce-super-bowl-ring-chilli-spt-intl/index.html
Aaron Pellish,"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will appear on Hawaii’s presidential ballot following a Friday ruling that blocked an effort by Hawaii Democrats to disqualify his campaign’s ballot access petition.Hawaii marks the third state where Kennedy has officially qualified for ballot access. He gained ballot access in Michigan, a key battleground state, earlier this week after qualifying for Utah’s ballot earlier this year.The ruling, issued by hearings officer Aaron Schulaner, said an objection filed by the Democratic Party of Hawaii “did not meet its burden of proof in this case” and the Kennedy campaign’s We the People Party – a minor party the campaign established to circumvent ballot access requirements – will be allowed to appear on Hawaii’s ballot in November.A spokesperson for the Hawaii Office of Elections confirmed to CNN that Friday’s ruling means Kennedy will appear on the state’s ballot. The Kennedy campaign and the Democratic Party of Hawaii did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Democratic Party of Hawaii’s objection centered on the validity of the We the People Party’s internal organization. Hawaii Democrats accused the Kennedy-aligned party of violating its own bylaws and Hawaii state laws by listing as part of its leadership people who had been previously registered as Democrats and people who weren’t registered voters.Kennedy’s campaign has said he’s gained enough signatures to qualify for the ballot in North Carolina, New Hampshire, Nevada, Nebraska, Idaho and Iowa. A super PAC backing Kennedy has said it has collected enough signatures to put Kennedy on the ballot in Georgia, Arizona and South Carolina.The Democratic Party of Hawaii’s failed effort to block Kennedy’s ballot access petition is part of a broader opposition to Kennedy’s candidacy from Democrats nationally. The Democratic National Committee has filed multiple Federal Elections Commission complaints against the Kennedy campaign and its allies, and Democrats have frequently run advertisements attempting to paint Kennedy as a spoiler candidate who will help former President Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee.Kennedy’s team has pushed back on Democrats’ messaging, previously telling CNN that donors “from across the political spectrum are supporting the Kennedy campaign as they are tired of the corruption in the two-party system.”“Instead, donors want an independent candidate who will heal the divide, restore the middle class, end the forever wars, unravel corporate capture, and the end chronic disease epidemic,” Kennedy campaign spokeswoman Stefanie Spear said in a February statement.Kennedy, 70, initially launched his presidential campaign as a Democrat challenging Biden in the primary last year, before pivoting to run as an independent in October. Last month, he announced attorney Nicole Shanahan, 38, as his vice presidential nominee at a campaign rally in Oakland, California.",2024-04-20 00:28:00,"RFK Jr. will appear on Hawaii ballot, third state to include him",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/19/politics/rfk-jr-will-appear-on-hawaii-ballot-third-state-to-include-him/index.html
Brian Lowry,"As war movies go, “The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare” ends up in a kind of no-man’s land, draping elements of “Mission: Impossible,” “Inglourious Basterds” and director Guy Ritchie’s brand of violent action-comedy over the bones of a fascinating World War II true story. The underwritten, somewhat messy results are broadly entertaining if not fully seaworthy from a dramatic point of view.Given that Henry Cavill (having entered his spy phase, between this and “Argylle”) and Alan Ritchson (“Reacher”) bring their considerable brawn to the festivities, it’s somewhat ironic how thin and un-fleshed-out the characters are. While Ritchie might have been in a hurry to get into the action, it comes at the expense of an investment in the individuals beyond the dire nature of the plot.That plot involves a secretive version of a nascent special-ops team – given the go-ahead by Winston Churchill himself (an unrecognizable Rory Kinnear) – a real group whose existence remained classified for decades before being detailed in a 2014 book. Adding a pinch of “The Dirty Dozen,” the squad operated under the leadership of a bad-attitude agent, Cavill’s Gus March-Phillipps, who had to be sprung from military prison to lead the group.Known as Operation Postmaster, the mission played a vital role in the war effort, seeking to sideline the supply chain outfitting Germany’s U-boats, knowing that the submarines’ presence in the Atlantic had, among other things, helped keep the US out of the war. Specifically, March-Phillipps and company are tasked with blowing up a supply vessel that requires overcoming enormous odds, understanding that the British government will disavow them, and the Germans will torture and kill them.The central quintet (rounded out by Henry Golding of “Crazy Rich Asians,” Hero Fiennes Tiffin and Alex Pettyfer) also receives logistical help from a female spy (“3 Body Problem” star Eiza González) tasked with seducing and distracting the German commander (“Basterds’” Til Schweiger) and a resourceful businessman (Babs Olusanmokun) operating out of the port, on the Spanish island Fernando Po, where the boat is docked.From the opening sequence, Ritchie (who previously teamed with Cavill on “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.”) works from the well-founded theory that the cathartic act of killing Nazis during World War II doesn’t require explanation. In keeping with a long tradition of movies built around dangerous wartime assignments (“The Guns of Navarone” also comes to mind), the best-laid plans never quite follow the script and inevitably call for improvisation.Still, the desire to adapt the film to fit producer Jerry Bruckheimer’s blockbuster filmography and Ritchie’s kinetic style keeps dragging it in that direction and away from the grit that would bolster its historical underpinnings. The closing crawl provides a clearer sense of those, in a way that merely heightens a wish Ritchie and his script collaborators had toned down the embellishment.Those who choose to can enjoy the movie strictly for its red-carpet-friendly cast and muscular mix of a caper with check-your-brain-at-the-door-type action. Even so, a bit more brains to go with all that brawn would have improved things considerably, and maybe even made these gentlemen (and lady) operators seem a bit more special.“The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare” premieres April 19 in US theaters.

Ben Morse,"In Istanbul in June 2023, Manchester City lift the Champions League trophy to cap a historic Treble-winning campaign.Over a billion dollars has been spent by the club’s Abu Dhabi-based owners since 2008 in recruiting players to transform City into a footballing and commercial juggernaut.Further down the soccer pyramid, Reading FC – recently relegated to the third tier of English football – is struggling to survive.Failure to pay players and tax bills have resulted in multiple points deductions for Reading, as it slides down the league amid numerous fan protests over the way the club is run.The contrast between the fortunes of Manchester City and clubs like Reading highlights the widening gap between the 20 teams in English soccer’s top-tier and the other 72 clubs, which come under the umbrella of the English Football League.So much so that football finance expert Kieran Maguire told CNN that British football currently has a “peasants vs. Marie Antoinette” relationship. A hated figure symbolizing wealth and conspicuous consumption, Marie Antoinette is famed as the last queen of France before the revolution.<h2>Disparity</h2>Thanks to its multi-billion-dollar TV deals, the Premier League is often celebrated as a UK Inc. success story. Meanwhile, EFL clubs vainly to try to play catch up.The financial disparity between the Premier League and EFL clubs is evident in their respective TV rights agreements. The most recent Premier League domestic broadcast deal is worth £6.7 billion ($8.5 billion) whereas the EFL’s TV deal with domestic package is worth £935 million ($1.19 billion).According to the Premier League website, the TV money is divided amongst the teams in the league, with 50% divided equally between the clubs, 25% awarded on a merit basis determined by final league positions and 25% distributed as a facilities fee for televised matches.While billion-dollar TV rights deals allow top-flight teams to sign the best talent from across the world, Premier League clubs are also very adept at hoovering up the most promising prospects from lower league sides.For example, a member of Liverpool’s recent League Cup winning side – James McConnell – was signed from the Sunderland academy, while highly-touted 17-year-old Welsh forward Gabriele Biancheri was snapped up Manchester United from Cardiff City.By targeting talents from lower-league academies, Premier League clubs don’t have to pay inflated transfer fees. It’s a sensible financial and recruitment strategy, but arguably denies lower league additional transfer revenue if they had been able to keep those prospective talents for a few more years.According to reports in UK media, a recent proposed deal would have seen $1.14 billion (£900 million) shared by the Premier League with the rest of the English football pyramid. But reportedly only 10 Premier League clubs agreed to the deal, thereby not meeting the 14-out-of-20 requirement for it to pass.Chair of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee and British MP, Caroline Dinenage said the actions of Premier League clubs “threatens the financial sustainability of clubs in communities up and down the country,” accusing the top-tier teams of “parking the bus.”The EFL’s stance is that more money should filter down through the English football pyramid to help its sustainability, a move which wouldn’t affect the Premier League’s success story.According to Maguire, the current impasse speaks to the lack of negotiating power the EFL has and the Premier League’s current voting structure.“Ultimately, the Premier League is a member’s club. It has 20 shareholders; it needs two thirds of those shareholders to agree to a change in any of the rules or to give [Premier League chief executive] Richard Masters a mandate to negotiate and sign off the deal with the EFL,” Maguire told CNN.“Therefore, it comes down to owners who have not been prepared to give up anything or give up very much because they would much rather have the cash now,” said Maguire.“Everybody’s acting in self-interest as opposed to the greater good of the game and you can understand that. We’d all rather pay less tax than more tax but sometimes you need somebody to knock heads together and see the bigger picture.”CNN contacted the Premier League for comment and they pointed towards Masters’ recent interview with The Times in which he talked about his concerns about an independent regulator.“It is a risk to bring politics and lobbying into football, especially when there are also genuine concerns regarding how truly independent the regulator will be,” Masters wrote.“We have spent the past year in discussions with the EFL about an even more generous financial settlement. But these talks have only served to highlight how destabilising intervention could be.“The EFL has indicated it would happily accept a generous new deal from the Premier League but would also immediately use the new regulator to seek even more money for its clubs, including the Championship, which is already the sixth-richest league in Europe, with many very wealthy club owners of its own.”<h2>‘Historic moment for football’</h2>The UK government’s legislation for an independent regulator would grant powers to a body, independent of football and government authorities, that will oversee men’s soccer in England’s top five tiers.The regulator will be able to block breakaway leagues like such as the European Super League, strengthen the tests for owners and directors of clubs and have powers to backstop the financial distributions between the Premier League, the EFL and National League, with the new body able to ensure a settlement is reached.The mooted introduction of an independent regulator comes against the backdrop of some Premier League clubs falling foul of the Premier League’s Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSR).Everton and Nottingham Forest have been handed points deductions for breaching financial rules previously agreed by the 20 top-flight clubs. Earlier this month, Everton were handed a further two-point deduction for allegedly breaching Premier League financial rules.And Manchester City – winners of five of the last six Premier League titles – has also been accused of breaching more than 100 financial rules, which includes failing to provide accurate financial information, failing to comply with UEFA’s financial fair play (FFP) regulations, and failing to follow Premier League rules on profit and sustainability.The club has continuously denied any wrongdoing and a conclusion to their case reportedly remains some time away.With both Nottingham Forest and Everton appealing the deduction of points, the final standings come the end of the Premier League season might be subject to change depending on the outcome of those appeals.The final round of Premier League fixtures are played on May 19 with the outcome of Nottingham Forest’s appeal reportedly expected by May 24, five days after the final day of the season.Both Forest and Everton are mired in a relegation battle near the bottom of the Premier League table, meaning the outcome of these appeals could have a dramatic impact on not only this season, but also the next one.The Premier League has said it hopes to resolve Everton’s appeal before the May 19 finish of the current season.The possibility of financial penalties ultimately deciding the fate of a 38-game Premier League season will potentially “damage the integrity” of the whole competition, according to Maguire.“You have to be honest, as far as international fans are concerned, their focus is very much on the top of the league,” he explains. “I think there’s far more concentration on all the positions in the table domestically and yes, the Premier League will suffer short term reputational damage.“As we’ve seen on many issues, football fans have remarkably short memories when it suits them and the focus within a few weeks, once the dust has settled on relegation, will be on who’s coming up, who’s going to be signed and so on in terms of summer transfer activity.”When contacted by CNN for comment, the Premier League pointed to their commitment to the implementation of a “swift development and implementation of a new League-wide financial system.”It added: “Premier League clubs also re-confirmed their commitment to securing a sustainably-funded financial agreement with the EFL, subject to the new financial system being formally approved by clubs.“The League and clubs also reaffirmed their ongoing and longstanding commitment to the wider game which includes £1.6 billion distributed to all levels of football across the current three-year cycle.“The Premier League’s significant funding contributions cover all EFL clubs and National League clubs, as well as women and girls’ football, and the grassroots of the game.”<h2>Value of Premier League status</h2>It’s not just in the Premier League where teams are falling foul of financial regulations.Leicester City, who sit near the top of the second tier of English football, was charged in March by both the Premier League and the EFL for breaching financial rules.Relegated from the Premier League in 2023, Leicester denies any wrongdoing and opened legal proceedings against the Premier League and the EFL, but could face a points deduction if found guilty.If it is promoted at the end of the season, it could begin its return to life in the Premier League with the points deduction.“Leicester City announcing that they’re going to issue proceedings against both the Premier League and the EFL has thrown a major spanner into the works,” Maguire said.“Clearly the club is very unhappy with what has happened in regards to charges from both parties and therefore they’ve decided to fight back as best they can to defend their position.”",2024-04-18 04:22:00,‘Peasants vs. Marie Antoinette’: What the Premier League does with its billions of dollars is riling 72 other soccer clubs,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/18/sport/premier-league-efl-regulator-spt-intl/index.html
George Ramsay,"Real Madrid will face Bayern Munich in the Champions League semifinals after defeating Manchester City in a tense penalty shootout on Wednesday.Defender Antonio Rüdiger struck the decisive blow for Real Madrid, burying his penalty into the bottom-left corner before his teammates piled on top of him in celebration.That saw a thrilling tie featuring eight goals across the two games draw to a close as the 14-time European champion triumphed 4-3 on penalties.“Madrid always deliver, that’s part of football,” said Los Blancos midfielder Federico Valverde. “The opposition came into the game stronger, playing better football than us and were favorites.“But we are Madrid and we dug in, defended well and fought hard. That’s how we won the game.”After a thrilling first leg between the two teams ended 3-3 in Madrid, City was fancied to advance in what transpired to be a night of high drama at the Etihad Stadium.Real gained the upper hand in the tie following Rodyrgo’s well-worked goal in the 12th minute.A superb piece of control from Jude Bellingham set up the prelude to the goal, allowing Valverde and Vinícius Jr. to combine and send in a cross to Rodrygo, who scored with his second attempt after his first shot was parried back to his feet by City goalkeeper Ederson.City pushed for an equalizer, and minutes later Erling Haaland struck the bar with a header before Kevin De Bruyne and Jack Grealish also went close.With Real happy to sit deep and defend, the home side continued to press in the second half and was rewarded when De Bruyne slammed a shot into the top of the net after Jérémy Doku’s probing cross into the box.De Bruyne had further chances to win the game for Man City but Real’s rear guard stood firm and the game remained 1-1, 4-4 on aggregate, after extra-time.In the penalty shootout, Luka Modrić’s first attempt was saved by Ederson but City’s advantage disappeared when Bernardo Silva struck his effort straight at a static Andriy Lunin.The Real goalkeeper then saved Mateo Kovačić’s penalty to swing the contest in his side’s favor. Lucas Vázquez, Phil Foden, Nacho, and Ederson all scored with their attempts before Rüdiger stepped up and sent Real into the semifinals.“We showed the attitude and commitment demanded by this jersey,” manager Carlo Ancelotti said after the game.“This is a very special competition for us and we always deliver something that people are not expecting us to produce. Everyone was writing us off but we’re still here.”For City, the chances of once again winning a treble – the Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup – have gone, making this weekend’s FA Cup semifinal against Chelsea even more important.“Congratulations to Real Madrid - they defended so deep with incredible solidarity,” said City manager Pep Guardiola. “We did everything. I don’t have any regrets about what we have done.“Always as managers we try to create more and concede less in every single game because that helps to win. We did everything, defensively and offensively … We played exceptionally in all departments. Unfortunately, we could not win.

"Homero De la Fuente,George Ramsay","The sale and relocation of the Arizona Coyotes to Salt Lake City, Utah has been approved by the National Hockey League’s (NHL) Board of Governors, the league announced on Thursday.The NHL team has been sold to Smith Entertainment Group, which is led by Ryan and Ashley Smith, who also own the Utah Jazz.The franchise will relocate to Salt Lake City immediately, playing at Delta Center alongside the Jazz, and will drop the puck in Utah later this year.“As everyone knows, Utah is a vibrant and thriving state, and we are thrilled to be a part of it.” NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement.“We are also delighted to welcome Ashley and Ryan Smith to the NHL family and know they will be great stewards of the game in Utah. We thank them for working so collaboratively with the League to resolve a complex situation in this unprecedented and beneficial way.”The NHL has left the door open for a new Coyotes team to return to Arizona.In order to gain reentry, current owner Alex Meruelo would need to construct a “new, state-of-the-art facility appropriate for an NHL team within five years,” the league said.Bettman added, “The NHL’s belief in Arizona never wavered. We thank Alex Meruelo for his commitment to the franchise and Arizona, and we fully support his ongoing efforts to secure a new home in the desert for the Coyotes.“We also want to acknowledge the loyal hockey fans of Arizona, who have supported their team with dedication for nearly three decades while growing the game.”On Thursday, Ryan Smith said that he wants to win championships and explained how he’s confident the new franchise will pull in lots of fans.“The one thing I do know about Utah is people show up,” said Smith, also a co-owner of Major League Soccer team Real Salt Lake. “We just had the NCAA Tournament here for basketball, and the entire arena was full. It’s just different here.“I mean, (the Jazz have) 291 straight sellout games at the Delta Center. I think every concert that’s come into town has sold out. It’s just what we do. We show up.

Matias Grez,"Dallas Mavericks star Kyrie Irving said he “just didn’t fit” into the 12-man basketball roster selected to represent Team USA at the upcoming Olympic Games.Irving has twice enjoyed success with USA Basketball (USAB) – winning gold at the 2014 FIBA World Cup and the Rio 2016 Olympics – and had outlined his desire to once again be part of an Olympic roster.However, Irving was left off the roster as selectors opted for first-time Olympian Steph Curry, Devin Booker, Jrue Holiday, Anthony Edwards and Tyrese Haliburton at the guard positions.The USA is looking for redemption of sorts after a disappointing FIBA World Cup last year in which the team finished without a medal. Only Haliburton and Edwards remain from that squad.“I wish my brothers well.

But again, I have nothing but respect for those guys over at USAB.“At this point in my career, I think my focus should be on winning a championship and in the summertime just going to support those guys when I get a chance.”Irving then began reminiscing about the old selection format for the national team, which he said included the group of players competing against each other in practices and scrimmages before the roster decisions were made.This year’s announcement process was certainly different, with USA Basketball managing director Grant Hill traveling across the country to personally deliver the Team USA jerseys to each player that was selected.“I grew up in a time, too, where we actually had to try out for USAB and we did meet up as a group and as peers and there was a mutual respect that we earned from one another, trying out and then seeing what five meshed well,” Irving said.“I think obviously the timing is a little bit different, but I kinda miss those days of just being able to get everybody together, break bread and then compete against one another. Then the deliberation process happens at the end of the four- or five-day process, even though people know who’s going to be on the team.“I miss that fun part of it, just getting together, but I wish my brothers well.”The US team will hold a training camp and exhibition games in Las Vegas beginning on July 5, before traveling to Paris.The Opening Ceremony for the 2024 Paris Olympics will take place on July 26 with men’s basketball play beginning the following day.",2024-04-19 06:27:00,Kyrie Irving says he ‘grew up in a time’ when you had to try out for USA Basketball after omission from Paris 2024,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/19/sport/kyrie-irving-team-usa-olympics-selection-spt-intl/index.html
Elisabeth Buchwald,"Columbia University President Minouche Shafik’s Wednesday testimony before a House committee on how the school responded to a professor’s controversial piece labeling Hamas’ October 7 attack a “resistance offensive” is at odds with the account the professor shared with CNN.Multiple lawmakers at Wednesday’s hearing on antisemitism at Columbia took particular issue with the professor, Joseph Massad’s, use of the word “awesome” in the piece describing scenes from the day of the attack, though not the attack itself.In the piece, Massad also said, “The sight of the Palestinian resistance fighters storming Israeli checkpoints separating Gaza from Israel was astounding.”Shafik told members of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce that she condemned the statements he made in the piece and was “appalled” by them. A university spokesperson confirmed that Massad was under investigation for allegedly making discriminatory remarks, as Shafik noted in her Wednesday testimony. Massad told CNN the investigation was “news” to him and he was not aware of it prior to Wednesday.When asked at the hearing if Massad, a tenured professor, faced any disciplinary action, Shafik responded he had been “spoken to” by the head of his department of Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies and his dean.Shafik said she did not participate in those discussions but that Massad was told the language he used in his piece “was unacceptable.”Massad told CNN no one said anything to him along those lines and he had not been reprimanded in any way.“I was shown solidarity by my chair and deans based on the death threats that I received and the campaign targeting me,” he said in an email to CNN.CNN reached out to his department chair and to the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to confirm Massad’s statements.The department chair did not respond, while the dean, Amy Hungerford, referred the inquiry to a university spokesperson who did not offer any comment.“Both stories cannot be true,” Republican Rep. Tim Walberg, who inquired at Wednesday’s hearing about any disciplinary actions regarding Massad’s piece, said in an emailed statement to CNN on Thursday.“If Professor Massad’s department chair showed ‘solidarity’ following his comments, it undermines President Shafik’s testimony and raises even more concerns about the antisemitic atmosphere amongst faculty,” he added. “We must figure out who is telling the truth.”Initially, Shafik said Massad was no longer chair of the Academic Review Committee at Columbia and that he “does not have a leadership role.” But when Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik pointed out that he’s still listed as the chair of the committee on a Columbia site, Shafik said she “wasn’t sure.”Massad told CNN he remains chair of the committee that oversees all areas of Arts and Sciences, which covers five different schools within Columbia, until his one-year term expires in a few weeks. “No one has contacted me at all from the university with regards to my current chairmanship,” he said, adding that he intends to remain a member of the committee next year for a three-year term.“Professor Massad has chaired his final meeting of the academic review committee,” a different Columbia spokesperson told CNN. The spokesperson did not respond when asked by CNN to clarify if that meant he had been removed.CNN reached out to other professors who were criticized during the hearing, as well.Mohamed Abdou, who Shafik said expressed support for Hamas on social media following October 7, did not respond to a request for comment.Columbia Business School assistant professor Shai Davidai, who Shafik said was under investigation for harassment, told CNN that he has never spoken against students by name, only “pro-Hamas” student organizations and professors.“They’re investigating me for the entire reason this hearing was held in the first place. Columbia is investigating me for my social media tweets and only my social media tweets,” he said.",2024-04-18 14:19:00,Professor who Columbia president said was ‘spoken to’ for calling Hamas invasion ‘astounding’ says he wasn’t disciplined,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/17/business/professor-columbia-president-hamas-attack/index.html
Ben Morse,"Major League Baseball superstar Shohei Ohtani’s record-setting $700 million deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers has been the talk of the baseball world on the field since the two-way star agreed to his 10-year contract in early December 2023.At the other end of the income scale is Gary Cooper.Born in 1956 in Savannah, Georgia, Cooper was drafted in the third round of the 1975 MLB Draft by the Atlanta Braves. Cooper, who played as an outfielder, was known for his speed.“If (Cooper) wasn’t the fastest man in baseball, he was right up there with the next guy,” Paul Snyder, longtime scouting director for the Atlanta Braves, told ESPN’s Andscape.Cooper spent 42 days with the team and on the 43rd day – the threshold for earning a mandatory MLB pension – was set to play a game before it was canceled due to rain. Before his next appearance, though, he was moved down to the minor leagues, never to return.And so for 44 years, Cooper has stood just one day off earning that mandatory league pension.CNN Sport has learnt that Cooper made two appeals to a committee comprising representatives of MLB and the Major League Baseball Players Association. Both appeals were rejected under the 43-day rule.However, the rainout had no impact on the number of days of service as the system doesn’t need a game to be played for that day to count.But now, an online petition seeks to rectify that. Started by Robert Jonas, the initiative aims for Cooper – aged 67 and long past his playing days – to be given a one-day contract on the Braves’ coaching staff so he reaches the 43-day minimum to qualify for the MLB pension. The petition has received nearly 5,000 signatures.“Still, Mr. Cooper has no car, no home to call his own, no savings, no pension, and struggles just to pay his phone bill every month,” Jonas writes at change.org. “To help support himself, Mr. Cooper works part-time as a landscaper, but lately work has been scarce.”Jonas told Georgia Public Broadcasting that he employed Cooper for a landscaping company he owns.It wouldn’t be unheard of for Cooper to be granted this request.In 1968, the Braves signed pitcher Satchel Paige, then in his 60s, to the coaching staff to help him get his pension.Cooper says he’d appreciate any help he could get.“Whatever they give me, I’ll accept it because it’s been so long, you know?” Cooper, who still lives in Savannah, told Georgia Public Broadcasting. “So anything’ll help.”Cooper has also received the support of Savannah Mayor Van R. Johnson II.“I am asking the @Braves to sign 67-year-old Gary Cooper of #Savannah to a 1 day contract to qualify for a @MLB pension,” Johnson posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.CNN has contacted the Braves for comment.Pension plans are nearly extinct in the US. About half of private sector workers were covered by those so-called defined-benefit plans in the mid-1980s, but by 2022, only 15% of private sector workers had them.",2024-04-18 13:43:00,"Gary Cooper missed out on an MLB pension by one day.

Matias Grez,"The Philadelphia 76ers had to overcome some early boos from their own fans as they edged past the Miami Heat, 105-104, to clinch the No. 7 seed in the Eastern Conference and book a playoff showdown with the New York Knicks.Some sloppy play early on helped the Heat open up a 14-point lead near the end of the first half of the Play-In Tournament game, with the home fans making their displeasure known as the 76ers continued to give up cheap turnovers.However, after struggling for three quarters, Joel Embiid came up big down the stretch, scoring 11 of his 23 total points in the fourth and helping the Sixers secure the comeback.Embiid, the reigning league MVP, also added 15 rebounds and five assists, but the Sixers were kept in the game by veteran Frenchman Nicolas Batum, who had 20 points – including six three pointers – off the bench.“It means a lot,” Embiid said of reaching the playoffs, per ESPN. “Being down a lot … we stuck together. It shows you that I don’t play my best, I don’t get to my spots the whole game until the fourth quarter and we still found a way to win.“They like to make it nasty and we can do it, too, and we made it nasty, too.”The 76ers were flying high in the Eastern Conference until Embiid underwent knee surgery back in February, with the team’s record falling off a cliff in the big man’s absence.He returned to the court at the beginning of April after eight weeks out and the 76ers now boast a 32-8 record this season with Embiid on the floor.However, after another unconvincing postseason performance, questions will likely continue to be asked about Philly’s championship aspirations with Embiid previously never making it past the conference semifinals.<h2>Bigger problems for the Heat</h2>On top of the Play-In defeat, the Miami Heat could now be without talisman Jimmy Butler who suffered an apparent knee injury during Wednesday’s contest.Butler stayed down clutching his knee after a hard landing at the end of the first quarter, with Kelly Oubre Jr. also falling on top of him. He managed to finish the remainder of the game but was clearly hampered as he scored 19 points on just 27.8% shooting.“I fell, he landed and my knee just didn’t do well, I guess,” Butler said, per ESPN. “I don’t know. It’s not a good feeling, I can tell you that.“It felt like I couldn’t do too much, which sucks with the timing of the game and everything. I hope that I’m fine. I hope that I wake up tomorrow and can still stick-and-move. Right now, I can’t say that’s the case.”Butler said he will undergo an MRI on Thursday, but reports from the Athletic and ESPN say the Heat are fearful he has an MCL injury.It is now déjà vu for the Heat who, as they did last season, find themselves in an elimination Play-In game to try and secure the No. 8 seed.The Heat will face the Chicago Bulls, who beat the Atlanta Hawks in Wednesday’s other play-in game, for a chance to face the overall No. 1 seeded Boston Celtics in the playoffs.",2024-04-18 06:30:00,Philadelphia 76ers silence boos from home crowd to edge past Miami Heat and reach playoffs,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/18/sport/philadelphia-76ers-miami-heat-play-in-tournament-spt-intl/index.html
Ben Morse,"‘Jurassic Park’ has just been released. The Chicago Bulls have won their third NBA title in a row. The last episode of ‘Late Night with David Letterman’ has been broadcast.Fast forward – there have been five more ‘Jurassic Park’ films since June 1993. The Bulls won another three-peat of titles. The ‘Late Night’ show franchise has seen multiple hosts.However, if you were a fan of German soccer club Bayer Leverkusen, little changed for you over those 31 years – there was just a lot of disappointment.Since winning the German Cup in 1993, Leverkusen relentlessly explored increasingly agonizing ways of spurning chances to win trophies.A 42-year-old man from Spain’s Basque Country has changed that though now.Xabi Alonso’s Midas touch has brought a modern day footballing miracle to Leverkusen, sweeping in a wave of positivity and optimism for a team often associated with heartbreak.Alonso might only have just set out on his managerial journey, but a 44-game unbeaten run is imperious for even the great teams in soccer history, but for one with Leverkusen’s history, it’s pretty remarkable.The current season has already reaped rewards in the form of the Bundesliga title, with potential domestic and European competition success transforming this into a season for the ages.But more than that, it has sought to banish the demons of years past.<h2>A new story</h2>“Neverkusen.” “Vizekusen” (“Second-kusen”). “The Eternal Bridesmaids.” “The Nearly Men.All nicknames Leverkusen had acquired for its uncanny ability to stumble at the last hurdle.It lost in painful circumstances to Real Madrid in the 2002 Champions League final due to one of the greatest goals in European Cup history. Die Schwarzroten have finished second in the league multiple times. The club has seen cult figures grace its doors before leaving for pastures new after the catalogue of gut-wrenching defeats.For Leverkusen’s long-suffering fans, they were there just to be ridiculed by rival fans.“When you’re going to the stadium and in the Bundesliga, all the other team’s fans say, ‘You’ll never win the Bundesliga,’ and this is hurting a little bit,” Olaf Schmidt – Leverkusen fan and volunteer at the club’s BayArena – told CNN Sport after traveling to London to watch his team play its Europa League quarterfinal second-leg tie against West Ham United.But Alonso has restored Leverkusen’s pride.The former Liverpool, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Spain international midfifelder has instilled a never-say-die attitude into his players; his squad has become renowned for its propensity to pull late goals out when the odds seem stacked against them – including on Thursday night when Jeremie Frimpong scored in the 89th minute to keep the longest unbeaten run in the history of Europe’s top four leagues (Germany, England, Spain and Italy) alive.Alonso has brought bravery to a team which has been personified by fragility.His players must be courageous to execute Alonso’s possession-based style of play and, through his signings and temperament, the Leverkusen coach has asked for bravery from those around him to believe in the system.Whether it be Florian Wirtz’s wizardry on the ball and incisive passes or the discipline needed from his defenders and goalkeeper to recycle possession in their own penalty area, this Leverkusen team has become a winning machine under the man from Tolosa.Not in their wildest dreams could Die Werkself fans have imagined their team would supplant Bayern Munich, the Bundesliga champion for the past 11 seasons, and in such emphatic fashion.And to the pocket of vocal Leverkusen supporters – dressed all in red, hopping up and down, celebrating their ‘Deutscher Meister’ campaign while serenading their favorite players – at the Olympic Stadium in London to see Bayer advance to the Europa League semifinals after drawing 1-1 with West Ham to win the quarterfinal tie 3-2 on aggregate, this means so much more.Leverkusen sealed its first league title in its 119 year history with five games to go, battering Werder Bremen 5-0 in front of the home fans to kickstart the party of all parties.Alonso was doused in beer, there were tears and fans streamed onto the pitch to celebrate an until now once-in-a-lifetime achievement.“It was unbelievable. I’ve only been a fan for around about 20-25 years, but I know a lot of people who were fans when the club came to the Bundesliga, which was 45 years ago,” Schmidt told CNN.“And we never could win the Bundesliga and it was so impressive. Everybody was on the pitch this evening, everybody was crying.”After years being the butt of the joke, Leverkusen fans could finally spin the narrative.“All our supporters, we sang: ‘We will never win the Bundesliga.’ It showed the verbal (middle) finger to others,” added Schmidt.German football values the structure of its club ownership, as evidenced by the 50+1 rule – where supporters will always retain a majority ownership of a team, even by one vote – to ensure fans retain a say in the running of the organization. This has historically meant that the Black and Reds aren’t beloved by their contemporaries due support and backing from pharmaceutical company Bayer.But Leverkusen’s seminal season under Alonso has superseded that and captured the imagination of many German football fans given it has come at Bayern Munich’s expense.And the season isn’t done yet. As well as reaching the semifinals of the Europa League, the 2023-24 campaign could finish with a famous treble as Leverkusen faces second-tier FC Kaiserslautern in the German Cup final in May.And as for all that pain and the mocking that came with it?“That’s history,” Uwe Schewiola, a Leverkusen fan since 1992, told CNN.",2024-04-19 05:58:00,Record 44-game unbeaten run brings to an end 31 years of hurt and ridicule for Bayer Leverkusen,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/19/sport/bayer-leverkusen-xabi-alonso-2024-spt-intl/index.html
Ben Morse,"The times they are a-changin’ in Buffalo this season.After years of falling short in the playoffs, the Bills decided to trade their star No. 1 receiver Stefon Diggs to the Houston Texans, a move which signaled a turning of the page for the organization.It leaves Buffalo with a glaring hole at the wideout position heading into next week’s draft and quarterback Josh Allen devoid of offensive options as they look to get over the hump and win their first ever Super Bowl title.Speaking ahead of what could be a crucial week for the Bills, Allen spoke about losing someone he loves “like a brother” and how tough team building in the NFL can be.“[Diggs] meant a lot. Look at the statistics. The numbers don’t lie,” Allen told reporters.The 27-year-old continued: “It’s definitely hard to part ways with a guy that’s been instrumental to our success here.“I wish we could keep everybody. We lost a lot of veteran leadership. It is what it is. I don’t get paid to make changes on the team.”Diggs, 30, was traded to the Texans in exchange for a 2025 second-round draft pick. Houston also receives a 2024 sixth-round pick (No. 189 overall) and a 2025 fifth-round pick.In four seasons with the Bills after being traded there in 2020, he racked up 5,372 receiving yards and 37 touchdowns. Diggs led the NFL with 127 catches and 1,535 yards in his first year in Buffalo.However, with consistent playoff struggles and the team struggling with its salary cap, the decision to move on from the veteran wide receiver was made.Allen’s current receiving crew lacks the star power associated with a team vying for a Super Bowl title, and the team is now predicted to target a pass catcher in the first round of the draft in late April.Luckily for the Bills, this year’s draft looks well stocked for wide receiver talent, with NFL’s draft expert Daniel Jeremiah ranking 12 out of his top 50 prospects as wide receivers, including three of the top four.However, general manager Brandon Beane – the man who is tasked with making personnel decisions for the organization – wouldn’t confirm whether Buffalo will select a pass catcher with its first round selection.“We have not filled a No. 1 role,” Beane told reporters. “I would say we have a group of guys as we sit here today who we believe bring different skill sets.“We like the group. Would we like to add to it at some point? Yes. But I’m not sitting here thinking we have a glaring hole. But I get the question, and I get the perception.”The Bills currently have the No. 28 pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, with the first round taking place on April 25 in Detroit.",2024-04-19 07:12:00,‘I wish we could keep everybody’: Buffalo Bills QB Josh Allen reflects on trade of star WR Stefon Diggs to Houston Texans,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/19/sport/josh-allen-trade-stefon-diggs-buffalo-bills-spt-intl/index.html
,"Ashley Moyer-Gleich will become only the second woman to referee an NBA playoff game after being selected as one of 36 first-round officials, the league announced on Thursday.It has been over a decade since a woman last officiated a playoff game. Violet Palmer became the first woman to be selected for a postseason assignment, featuring in nine games between 2006 and 2012.Moyer-Gleich – a former Division II college basketball player at Millersville University in her native state of Pennsylvania – described her selection as “surreal.”“I worked four games as an alternate last year, so obviously, my goal was I wanted to be an alternate again because that’s just sustaining the growth that I’ve had in my career,” she said, per NBA.com. “And then to see my name on list of working floor officials … I mean, my mom was with me, she came with me on my last two games for a little trip, and to open that email and have her there with me and share that news, it was really quite amazing.”Per the National Basketball Referees Association, Moyer-Gleich joined the NBA’s full-time officiating staff in November 2018, having previously refereed in the NBA’s G-League as well as in the WNBA. She worked over 200 regular season games across six seasons before receiving the postseason nod this year.The 36-year-old is one of three officials making their playoff debut, alongside Marat Kogut and J.T. Orr.As the playoffs progress and the field of teams is trimmed down, so is the officiating crew. Only 12 referees are selected for the NBA Finals and receive a coveted white warmup jacket, something that Moyer-Gleich has made a long-term ambition.“Obviously that’s an aspiration and that’s a goal way far down the road,” she said. “And hopefully I can continue on the same trajectory, continue to increase my responsibility on the floor, maybe going from the referee to a crew chief at some point and then hopefully getting to the finals — the epitome of what we do.“Whether I’m the first or not, I think just a female breaking through and getting that opportunity would be monumental.”",2024-04-19 06:46:00,Ashley Moyer-Gleich becomes second woman ever to be selected to officiate in NBA playoffs,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/19/sport/moyer-gleich-nba-second-woman-playoff-spt-intl/index.html

Ramishah Maruf,"A federal agency accused a popular gas station chain of discriminating against Black, Native American and multiracial applicants in its hiring practices.The Sheetz criminal screening process disproportionately screened out applicants from those legally protected groups, the lawsuit announced by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on Thursday alleged. The gas station chain screens and rejects applicants who have criminal records, the EEOC said.Those employment practices violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination in the workplace, the suit said.Criminal records have been a barrier for certain workers to find jobs. More than half of unemployed men in their 30s have a history of criminal conviction or arrest that keeps them from fully participating in the labor market, a 2022 study from nonprofit research group RAND Corporation found. And minority groups who are incarcerated at higher rates relative to Whites can be put at even more of a disadvantage.The lawsuit doesn’t claim Sheetz was actively motivated by race when rejecting applicants. In a statement, Sheetz said it “does not tolerate discrimination of any kind.”“We take these allegations seriously.  We have attempted to work with the EEOC for nearly eight years to find common ground and resolve this dispute.  We will address the claims in Court when the time comes,” Nick Ruffner, PR Manager for Sheetz, said in a statement.The EEOC said the case is going to court after failing to reach a pre-litigation settlement.The alleged illegal hiring practices have taken place in Maryland since at least 2015, the lawsuit said.As part of the hiring process, applicants must answer questions about their criminal justice history and go through a background check through a third-party vendor. Those who fail the screening do not get hired.About 14.5% of Black applicants failed the screening, while less than 8% of White applicants failed, according to the lawsuit. Native Americans and multiracial applicants failed at a rate of about 13%.“Black job applicants comprise a disproportionately high number of the total number of job applicants whom Defendants have refused to hire because of criminal justice history information,” the lawsuit said. The lawsuit added that according to published statistics, Black people and Native Americans in the United States “are subject to arrest, conviction, and incarceration at significantly higher rates relative to White persons.”The EEOC said there are other screening methods available that wouldn’t discriminate.“Even when such necessity is proven, the practice remains unlawful if there is an alternative practice available that is comparably effective in achieving the employer’s goals but causes less discriminatory effect,” said EEOC Regional Attorney Debra M. Lawrence in a statement.The lawsuit seeks an order for Sheetz to end its current hiring practice and create equal employment policies and programs. It also seeks back pay for the affected applicants.Sheetz has more than 600 stores in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, Ohio and North Carolina.

Ben Church,"Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp said he was “disappointed” to see his side knocked out of the Europa League quarterfinals against Atalanta on Thursday, but insisted talisman Mohamed Salah was not to blame.Liverpool couldn’t overcome the 3-0 deficit from the first leg, winning 1-0 in Italy but losing 3-1 on aggregate.Salah had converted a penalty in the seventh minute to give his side hope of an unlikely comeback, but the English Premier League side failed to make the most of its dominance in large portions of the game.Salah himself missed a glorious chance to put his side 2-0 up in the first half, getting his lobbed finish all wrong after catching Atalanta goalkeeper Juan Musso off his line.It’s the latest in a long run of missed chances, with the Egyptian failing to rediscover his clinical form after sustaining a muscle injury at the Africa Cup of Nations in January.Had he scored it, which he probably should have, Liverpool would have piled pressure on Atalanta which was forced to defend resolutely for much of the first half.“I am not particularly concerned,” Klopp told reporters when asked about Salah’s recent form.“That’s what strikers do, that’s what happens to strikers, that’s how it is. We have to go through this, he has to go through that. He is one of the most experienced players we have in the squad. We will go through that but that’s pretty much all.“It’s not that Mo [Salah] didn’t miss chances before in his life, that’s a part of the game. The penalty was super-convincing, a super penalty, then the next chance, that was obviously unlucky but it is not the first time he missed a chance like that.”After Klopp announced his decision to step down as Liverpool manager at the end of the season, many involved with the club had hoped to send off the 56-year-old German with another European trophy.Fans had earmarked the Europa League final in Dublin, Ireland, as Klopp’s potential last game in charge, but those plans came crashing down on a frustrating night in Italy.Klopp insisted the game was not lost in the return leg, but in the disappointing 3-0 defeat at Anfield last week.“It’s very easy to congratulate Atalanta because they deserved to go through. When you win a tie against us 3-1, especially in this way, you deserve to go through, absolutely,” added Klopp after his last Euorpean game in charge of Liverpool.Elsewhere on Thursday, fellow Premier League side West Ham crashed out of the Europa League quarterfinals after losing 3-1 on aggregate to Bayer Leverkusen.It followed the defeats suffered by Arsenal and Manchester City in the Champions League on Wednesday, meaning there will be no English team in the semifinals of either competition for the first time since the 2014/15 season, per Opta.<h2>English Premier League title race</h2>With such disappointment in Europe for English clubs, all attention now turns back to the Premier League title race.After Liverpool and Arsenal suffered shock defeats on Sunday, reigning champion Manchester City moved top of the table and look favorites to go on to win the title.But with both Arsenal and Liverpool just two points behind, there is all to play for with just six games remaining.Klopp, hoping to leave Liverpool with the perfect present of a league title, said his side can now fully focus on the remainder of the campaign. It faces Fulham in its next league game on Sunday.“We have a few days to recover, we will do that, and then will travel the day after tomorrow to London and will play Fulham, which will be tricky but we will give our absolute all.

Michael Nam,"A male columnist has apologized for a cringeworthy moment during former University of Iowa superstar and college basketball’s highest scorer Caitlin Clark’s first news conference as an Indiana Fever player.The Wednesday exchange went viral on social media, and critics said it underscored the difficulties many female athletes have in gaining respect and equal treatment from sports journalists, who are frequently male.The discussion began with Gregg Doyel, a columnist for The Indianapolis Star newspaper’s IndyStar website, making a heart with his hands to Clark, a gesture Clark often used during her college basketball career.Clark responded, “You like that?” Doyel replied, “I like that you’re here,” and Clark explained, “Yeah, I do that at my family after every game.” Then Doyel added, “Start doing it to me and we’ll get along just fine.”Doyel apologized later that same day.“Today in my uniquely oafish way, while welcoming @CaitlinClark22 to Indy, I formed my hands into her signature [heart hands emoji],” he wrote in a post on X shortly after the incident. “My comment afterward was clumsy and awkward. I sincerely apologize.”In a separate post on X, he added: “Caitlin Clark, I’m so sorry. Today I was part of the problem,” the title of his apology column that published Wednesday.Even though Doyel posted his apologies to the social media platform, and in his own column, for the sexist remarks he made to the basketball phenom, the discussion he provoked about misogyny in sports hasn’t come to a close.Doyel’s back and forth with Clark was almost universally panned online. Media figures from Nicole Auerbach of The Athletic and NBC to Dave Portnoy (whose own Barstool Sports has been accused of upholding a sexist culture) slammed Doyel after the clip spread across the internet.Meanwhile, the Indy Star writer went so far as to use the stages of grief to illustrate how he arrived at his moment of clarity.“After going through denial, and then anger — I’m on the wrong side of this? Me??? — I now realize what I said and how I said it was wrong, wrong, wrong. I mean it was just wrong,” he wrote in his column. “Caitlin Clark, I’m so sorry.”But users on X accused him of using the incident as a way to produce content and of missing the point of the offending behavior.The controversy also comes as conversations about how WNBA players are compensated heat up and as the power of women in entertainment and sports reaches unprecedented heights.",2024-04-18 15:23:00,Sports columnist apologizes for ‘oafish’ comments directed at Caitlin Clark.

Bryan Mena,"Mortgage rates soared this week, breaching the key 7% threshold and extending America’s housing affordability crisis.The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.10% in the week ending April 18, up from 6.88% the previous week, according to Freddie Mac data released Thursday. A year ago, the average 30-year fixed-rate was 6.39%.Breaching 7% represents a psychological threshold that hadn’t yet been crossed this year and adds to pressures buffeting the US housing market during the crucial spring homebuying season.Mortgage rates are climbing based on expectations that the Federal Reserve won’t cut interest rates anytime soon. The Fed doesn’t directly set mortgage rates, but its actions do influence them, and persistently hot inflation readings are keeping the Fed on hold.“As rates trend higher, potential homebuyers are deciding whether to buy before rates rise even more or hold off in hopes of decreases later in the year,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, in a statement.In a separate report, the National Association of Realtors reported that US home sales declined sharply in March in a sign that homebuyers are waiting on the sidelines as they contend with a tough housing market.<h2>Americans might not get much of a break this year</h2>Fed officials have already signaled they expect fewer rate cuts this year than they previously thought, based on recent economic data showing that progress on inflation has stalled. Some economists have floated the possibility that the Fed might not cut rates this year at all — and a couple of central bank officials have even mentioned the possibility of another rate hike.That has sent bond yields soaring. Mortgage rates track the benchmark 10-year US Treasury yield, which has risen to its highest level since November at 4.637%. The Consumer Price Index for March came in hotter than expected, weighing on the stock market and also prompting forecasters to push back their estimates for the first rate cut.If inflation stalls further, or even worsens, mortgage rates could climb higher.“Homebuying is such a major decision that people have the calculator in front of them. So if it’s 7.01% then it’ll be an emotional shock, but nonetheless I think they’re going to plant a number into the calculator and see whether their monthly payment is manageable or not,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said on a call with reporters Thursday.Home buyers are being stymied not just by high mortgage rates, but also by elevated home prices nationwide.The median price of an existing home was $393,500 last month, NAR reported Thursday, an increase of 4.8% from a year earlier. That was the highest March price on record. February prices also reached a record high. Today’s housing market is tough by many measures, but Americans are also enjoying one of the strongest job markets in history.<h2>A persistent undersupply of housing</h2>A lack of inventory has been a longstanding issue for America’s housing market.That has slowly improved in recent months, rising 4.7% in March from the prior month and up 14.4% last month year-over-year, according to NAR data. But housing supply overall still isn’t keeping up with demand, which is weighing on affordability.“We need more inventory, definitely, for the health of the market,” Yun said.Homeowners who locked in a low mortgage rate before the Fed began to hike rates in 2022 have largely preferred to not sell their homes. Yun has said previously that life changes such as marriage, divorce and new children could eventually force those homeowners to just give up on waiting for mortgage rates to fall and sell their homes.At the current pace of sales, it would take 3.2 months to exhaust the current level of homes on the market, up from 2.9 months in February and 2.7 months in March 2023.<h2>Uncertainty over NAR settlement</h2>There is also lingering uncertainty over the historic NAR settlement that was announced in March and is expected to change how homebuyers and sellers pay their real estate agents. It hasn’t been approved by the courts yet, but it is already changing the behavior of home shoppers and sellers — even before new rules take effect in July.Yun said first-time buyers trickled back into the market last month “because people heard about the lawsuit settlement where the buyers possibly need to come up with extra funds to pay for professional representation, but they want to do it before the new rules take place.”Prospective homebuyers have told CNN they’re hopeful that the settlement will mean lower homes prices, offsetting the pain of elevated mortgage rates, but many Realtors say there are many unknowns.“This is unchartered territory,” Debra Dobbs, a Realtor in Chicago, told CNN previously of the potential new rules.This story has been updated with additional developments and context.",2024-04-18 14:54:00,"Mortgage rates surge past 7%, reaching highest level since November",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/18/economy/mortgage-rates-7-percent/index.html
"Laura He,Olesya Dmitracova","Oil prices jumped overnight after explosions were reported near the Iranian city of Isfahan, but those gains dissipated Friday as officials sought to play down the latest escalation in Middle East tensions.Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, was down 0.4% at $86.8 per barrel, having earlier spiked more than 3%. US crude futures slipped 0.3% to trade at $82.50, also reversing earlier gains.Israel carried out a military strike inside Iran, a US official told CNN, a move that could push the oil-rich region deeper into conflict. The Israeli military has not commented, and Iran has not identified the source of the attack.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had said Thursday that the country would make its “own decisions” when responding to Iran’s unprecedented airstrikes last weekend, most of which were intercepted. Iran launched the attack in retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike on its embassy compound in Syria earlier this month.The overnight attack on Iran and “the threat of retaliation to it” has increased the risk to physical supply of oil, although the market response in European hours “suggests that some of that risk has already been priced in,” Neil Shearing, chief economist at consultancy Capital Economics, wrote in a note Friday.Oil prices have gained about 15% so far this year, driven higher by fear of a wider Middle East conflict, supply curbs by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and expectations of stronger Chinese demand.The oil market’s biggest fear is that a wider war could disrupt shipping through the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway off Iran’s southern border through which more than a quarter of global maritime oil trade flows each day.Iran is a big oil producer but exports most of its crude to China because of long-standing international sanctions. Still, a reduction in Iranian oil exports would have a “massive” impact on the global market as China would be forced to compete with other countries for supplies, according to Richard Bronze, co-founder of data firm Energy Aspects.There are also risks to oil supply elsewhere, analysts at ANZ, a bank, noted Friday.The United States has announced that it will reinstate sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry, which could disrupt its exports. Mexico also said earlier this month that it would cut back oil exports because of strong domestic demand.Other markets also reacted strongly initially to the latest salvo in the Middle East conflict. Gold prices jumped as traders rushed into safe-haven assets, although they trimmed those gains in European hours.Most stock markets in Asia closed sharply lower. Taiwan’s Taiex index tumbled 3.8%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 ended 2.7% down. South Korea’s Kospi closed 1.6% lower. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell 1%.The market impact weakened as Iranian state-aligned media reported that the attack appeared to be limited in scope. A regional intelligence source with knowledge of Iran’s potential reaction to Friday’s strike said direct state-to-state strikes between the country and Israel were “over.”European stock markets were trading only slightly lower by 6:30 a.m. ET. The region’s benchmark Stoxx 600 index was 0.4% down.Meanwhile, Israel’s benchmark Tel Aviv 125 Index, which comprises the 125 most valuable companies on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, was flat.On Thursday, S&P Global Ratings cut the country’s sovereign credit rating to A+ from AA- on increased geopolitical risk from its war with Hamas and friction with Iran.“We expect a wider regional conflict will be avoided, but the Israel-Hamas war and the confrontation with (Iran-backed) Hezbollah appear set to continue throughout 2024,” S&P analysts wrote.Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages.",2024-04-19 06:48:00,Oil prices get short-lived boost from attack on Iran,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/19/investing/oil-prices-gold-stocks-israel-iran-attack-intl-hnk/index.html
Juliana Liu,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.Apple has removed WhatsApp and Threads from its app store in China, following an order from the country’s internet watchdog which cited national security concerns.“We are obligated to follow the laws in the countries where we operate, even when we disagree,” an Apple spokesperson told CNN on Friday. “The Cyberspace Administration of China ordered the removal of these apps from the China storefront based on their national security concerns. These apps remain available for download on all other storefronts where they appear.”The apps, both owned by Meta (META), were already blocked in China and not widely used. They could be accessed in the country only by using virtual private networks (VPNs) that can encrypt internet traffic and disguise the user’s online identity.The removal of the apps by Apple (AAPL) represents a “further distancing between already separated tech universes” in the country and beyond, said Duncan Clark, chairman of Beijing-based investment advisory BDA China.“It will cause inconvenience to consumers and businesses (in China) who deal with family, friends or customers overseas. Even if they use VPNs to access their existing WhatsApp apps, these over time will become obsolete and require updating,” he said.Other popular Western social media apps including X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, Instagram and Messenger are still available on Apple’s China app store, according to a check by CNN.The tech giant’s announcement comes against a backdrop of plunging iPhone sales in the world’s second largest economy. Its smartphone sales tumbled a stunning 10% in the first quarter of this year, according to market research firm IDC.The company has lost momentum in China as nationalism, a rough economy and increased competition have hurt Apple over the past several months.The resurgence of Huawei and other Chinese brands, including Xiaomi and OPPO/OnePlus, will likely continue, according to IDC. Chinese consumers who once would have considered Apple are now turning to the country’s national brands.Besides being a key production center, China remains an important market for Apple as it is the largest market behind the United States.

Bryan Mena,"Taylor Swift is continuing her lucrative legacy with the release of her 11th studio album, “The Tortured Poets Department.”Swift commands a fiercely dedicated fan base — one that helps her break streaming records, crashes websites, and sells out major stadiums across the world. Her latest album – a surprise double album that had fans up all night to stream a whopping 31 tracks – is expected to draw that same burning enthusiasm from fans, yet again.It’ll be an extension of her legacy not just as a pop superstar, but also as a businessperson.Swift proved just how much economic power she wields in 2023. Tickets for her career-defining “Eras” tour sold out almost immediately, fans splurged on merchandise while attending her concerts, the film of her tour broke box office records in its opening weekend, and Swift herself became a billionaire along the way.Swift achieved remarkable feats that would be impressive for any typical business leader running a Fortune 500 company. She provided an excellent case study of understanding your customers and giving them what they want.“She’s a powerhouse, business-wise,” Armen Shaomian, an  associate professor of sport and entertainment management at the  University of South Carolina, told CNN.Here’s a look at Swift’s booming track record as a businessperson.<h2>The commercially successful ‘Eras’ tour</h2>The Eras tour was massively successful in 2023 and it’ll stretch through the end of this year. StubHub said Swift’s tour “was the biggest” in the ticket company’s two-decade history, outpacing other successful acts in terms of ticket sales.“Taylor Swift wasn’t just performing; she was rewriting the  playbook, leaving a trail of glitter, economic stimuli and friendship  bracelets wherever she went,” the company’s year-end report said.Swift herself hasn’t released official sales figures, but some estimates show the tour is already raking in 10 figures. Pollstar estimated that the tour’s first 60 shows grossed more than $1 billion.An analysis shared exclusively with CNN last year projected that Swift’s shows in North America alone could bring in more than $2 billion in revenue, making it the highest-grossing tour ever.Swift’s gravitational pull was so strong that fans were  aggressively bidding up ticket prices on the re-sale market. SeatGeek  previously told CNN the average resale price of an “Eras” ticket was  $1,607, up 741% from her “Reputation” tour in 2018, for which the average resale ticket price was $191.She is a generous boss, too, awarding $100,000 bonuses to Eras Tour truck drivers during the summer.The tour itself was like a traveling ball of economic activity, crisscrossing through major American cities as fans descended with cash burning holes through their wallets.Hotel rooms in cities hosting Eras shows filled up fast,  retailers said they got a boost from concertgoers seeking clothes to  match the tour’s theme, and a Federal Reserve report even noted how the  tour boosted hotel revenue in Philadelphia, according to one business in  the survey.<h2>Swift’s business acumen</h2>What really highlights Swift’s business acumen is how the  singer capitalized on that burning enthusiasm to drive even more sales.  Electrified fans opened their wallets to snap up shirts, sweaters, hats,  posters and other kinds of merchandise exhibiting the singer in all her  glory.“The merchandising aspect of the tour was so important  because it allowed fans to bring home some of that experience since it’s  all about the memories,” Shaomian of the University of South Carolina  said.“Fans were lining up hours before the arena even opened  because the merchandise was set up in a different area and they wanted  first dibs on buying. Even if only a quarter of those people bought  something, that’s easily at least a million dollars a night,” he said.That’s on top of merchandise available online. From guitar  picks to nail gems, Swift gave her ardent fans another reason to spend  more, and spend they did.Swift’s business strategy went beyond the concert stage to  the big screen, again capitalizing on the already-feverish hype for the  singer and her signature tour.The singer-songwriter released a film of last year’s shows in mid-October, titled “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour.” The film raked in a staggering $96 million in its opening weekend in the United States and Canada, according to movie theater chain AMC. That made it the highest grossing concert film domestically for an opening weekend.“It took less than 24 hours for the Taylor Swift The Eras  Tour concert film to shatter AMC’s US record for the highest  ticket-sales revenue during a single day in AMC’s 103-year history,” AMC  said at the time.And what business leader doesn’t benefit from some good publicity?In addition to countless other news stories, Swift was named Time magazine’s Person of the Year in 2023, an honor usually reserved for changemakers such as Barack Obama, Angela Merkel and Pope Francis.“It feels like the breakthrough moment of my career,  happening at 33,” Swift told Time. “And for the first time in my life, I  was mentally tough enough to take what comes with that.”",2024-04-19 08:50:00,‘The Tortured Poets Department’ will expand Taylor Swift’s reach as a businesswoman,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/18/business/economic-sales-new-album-taylor-swift/index.html
"Diksha Madhok,Rachel Wilson","Indians have started casting their votes in an election that’s expected to hand Prime Minister Narendra Modi another five years in office to steer the country’s rapid economic expansion.Under his leadership, India is poised to become a 21st-century economic powerhouse, offering a real alternative to China for investors and consumer brands hunting for growth and manufacturers looking to reduce risks in their supply chains.While ties between Beijing and the West are becoming increasingly frayed, India enjoys healthy relations with most major economies and is aggressively wooing large companies to set up factories in the country.So, is the hype around Modi’s India, which remains a largely impoverished country, justified?The quality of economic data in India can be unreliable, which makes it tough to evaluate the reality on the ground in the world’s most populous nation.But by using data from official or authoritative sources, CNN has created five charts to show how the country has performed since Modi first rose to power in 2014, and to look ahead at the challenges the next leader will face in managing the world’s fastest growing major economy.<h2>Still very poor</h2>India’s economy was worth $3.7 trillion in 2023, making it the world’s fifth largest, having jumped four spots in the rankings during Modi’s decade in office.The South Asian giant’s economy is comfortably placed to expand at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years, but analysts say it should be targeting growth of 8% or more if it wants to become an economic superpower.Sustained expansion will push India higher up the ranks of the world’s biggest economies, with some observers forecasting the country to become number three behind only the US and China by 2027.However, India could do much more to raise its gross domestic product (GDP) per person, a measure of living standards according to which it ranked a lowly 147 in 2022, according to the World Bank.According to Guido Cozzi, professor of macroeconomics at the University of St Gallen in Switzerland, there will be “trickle down effects on per-capita GDP” as the economy grows. But he cautioned that “trickle-down economics is not guaranteed to reduce income inequality, and policies that promote inclusive growth may be necessary.”<h2>Building modern India</h2>Much as China did more than three decades ago, India is beginning a massive infrastructure transformation by spending billions on building roads, ports, airports and railways. Meanwhile, private investors are building the world’s biggest green energy plant.In this year’s federal budget alone, $134 billion was carved out for capital spending to boost economic expansion.The results can be seen on the ground with furious construction underway across the nation. India added nearly 55,000 kilometers (around 35,000 miles) to the national highway network, an increase of 60% in the overall length, between 2014 and 2023. Infrastructure development has many benefits for the economy, including creating jobs and improving the ease of doing business.In recent years, the country has also built a range of tech platforms — known as digital public infrastructure — that have transformed lives and businesses.For example, the Aadhaar program, launched in 2009, has provided millions of Indians with proof of identity for the first time ever. The world’s largest biometric database has also helped the government save millions by reducing corruption in welfare initiatives.Another platform, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), allows users to make payments instantly by scanning a QR code. It has been embraced by Indians from all walks of life, from coffee shop owners to beggars, and allowed millions of dollars to flow into the formal economy.In September 2023, citing a World Bank report, Modi said that thanks to its digital public infrastructure “India has achieved financial inclusion targets in just six years which would otherwise have taken at least 47 long years.”<h2>Stock market superpower</h2>The excitement around India’s growth potential is reflected in its stock market, which has been hitting record highs. The value of companies listed on India’s exchanges surpassed $4 trillion late last year.India has two major exchanges: the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) and the BSE, Asia’s oldest bourse formerly known as the Bombay Stock Exchange.Thanks to the sizzling rally, the NSE has overtaken both the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Exchange to become the world’s sixth largest bourse, data from the World Federation of Exchanges showed in January.Domestic investors, both retail and institutional, have been driving India’s stock market to unprecedented peaks.According to Macquarie Capital, retail investors alone own 9% of India’s equity market value, while foreign investors are at slightly less than 20%. Analysts, however, expect foreign investments to pick up in the second half of 2024, once the election is out of the way.<h2>Humming factories</h2>The Modi government is aggressively trying to capitalize on the massive rethink underway among companies on supply chains. International firms want to diversify their operations away from China, where they faced obstacles during the pandemic and are threatened by rising tension between Beijing and Washington.Asia’s third largest economy has launched a production-linked incentive program worth $26 billion to attract companies to set up manufacturing in 14 sectors, ranging from electronics and automobiles to pharmaceuticals and medical devices.As a result, some of the world’s biggest firms, including Apple (AAPL) supplier Foxconn, are expanding their operations significantly in India.Billionaire Elon Musk said last week on X that he is “looking forward” to meeting Modi in India, without giving a date. The Tesla (TSLA) boss is expected to announce a major investment in India soon, with the automaker reportedly scouring the country for a suitable location for its first Asian factory outside China.Until two years ago, Apple would typically start assembling models in the country only seven to eight months after launch. That changed in September 2022, when Apple started making new iPhone 14 devices in India weeks after they went on sale.Analysts have called the change in strategy a big win for Modi, as growing manufacturing ties with a US giant like Apple will in turn attract other global players in the electronics manufacturing ecosystem to India.According to market research firm Canalys, up to 23% of iPhones will be made in India by the end of 2025, up from 6% in 2022.<h2>Where are the jobs?</h2>Still, India’s economy, much like its democracy, is far from perfect. If re-elected, Modi has to tackle the enormous challenge of creating hundreds of millions of jobs for a population that remains largely impoverished.With an average age of 29 years, India has one of the youngest populations globally, but the country is not yet able to reap the potential economic benefits from its large, youthful population.According to a report last month by the International Labour Organization, educated Indians between the ages of 15 and 29 are more likely to be unemployed than those without any schooling, which reflects “a mismatch with their aspirations and available jobs.”Youth unemployment rates in India are now higher than global levels, it added.The unemployment rate for young Indians with a graduate degree was over 29%, almost nine times higher those who can’t read or write, the report said.“The Indian economy has not been able to create enough remunerative jobs in the non-farm sectors for new educated youth labour force entrants, which is reflected in the high and increasing unemployment rate,” it added.",2024-04-18 23:30:00,Can India become an economic superpower?

"Chris Isidore,Peter Valdes-Dapena","Tesla has been ordered to recall nearly 4,000 of its Cybertrucks due to an accelerator pedal that can stick in place when pressed down.The cause, according to the regulator: soap.“An unapproved change introduced lubricant (soap) to aid in the component assembly of the pad onto the accelerator pedal. Residual lubricant reduced the retention of the pad to the pedal,” the NHTSA wrote in the recall document.Tesla has yet to detail how many of the futuristic looking Cybertrucks it has produced. But it has said that it would be slow ramping up production of the vehicle, which had its first deliveries in late November.The NHTSA said the recall affects “all Model Year (‘MY’) 2024 Cybertruck vehicles manufactured from November 13, 2023, to April 4, 2024.”That means the 3,878 trucks being recalled are likely many, if not all, of the trucks now on US roads.Documents from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration about the recall say that “when high force is applied to the pad on the accelerator pedal, the pad may dislodge, which may cause the pedal to become trapped in the interior trim above the pedal.”The safety regulator said workers assembling the trucks at Tesla’s factory near Austin, Texas, improperly used soap to aid in the component assembly of the pad onto the accelerator pedal.The accelerator sticking issue was first raised in social media and online discussion group posts.On Monday, NHTSA told CNN it had reached out to Tesla requesting more information on the issue.Telsa did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company this month told employees it would lay off roughly 10% of its global workforce.Unlike many Tesla recalls, this one cannot be fixed with a simple over-the-air software update. Tesla will have to have owners respond to letters and bring the Cybertrucks into its service centers for a repair at no charge.",2024-04-19 09:02:00,Tesla recalls Cybertruck due to accelerator pedal that can stick,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/19/business/tesla-cybertruck-recall/index.html
Diksha Madhok,"Tesla may be close to unlocking a massive new market.CEO Elon Musk is due to arrive in India next week for a visit that is expected to include a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and confirmation that Tesla plans to build a factory in the world’s most populous country.Musk posted last week on X that he is “looking forward” to meeting Modi. The billionaire did not mention a date, but Indian media and Reuters reported, citing unnamed sources, that he is expected to meet the Indian leader next week in New Delhi.He is also planning to meet Indian space tech startups during his visit. Pawan Chandana, co-founder of Skyroot Aerospace, which launched India’s first privately developed rocket in 2022, told CNN he will be meeting Musk on Monday. Apart from Tesla (TSLA), Musk is also the boss of rocket company SpaceX and X, formerly Twitter.Currently the world’s fourth richest man, Musk is likely to announce an investment of $2 billion to $3 billion in the South Asian country, mainly for building the new Tesla factory, Reuters and Financial Times reported, citing anonymous sources.A Musk-Modi meeting next week would come just days after India commenced the world’s largest democratic election. An estimated 960 million people in the country of 1.4 billion are eligible to vote in the polls, which started on Friday and will take more than a month to complete. Modi is widely expected to clinch a rare third consecutive five-year term as prime minister.“In the last ten years we have made significant progress in the manufacturing sector,” Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said in its election manifesto this week.Tesla opened its first Asian factory in 2019 in Shanghai, and it now produces hundreds of thousands of cars for the vast Chinese market and for export. If the investment in India is announced, it would be a boost to Modi’s efforts to make India a major global manufacturing hub.“We will make Bharat a trusted global manufacturing hub through a series of programmes including simplification of regulatory processes, investment in infrastructure … bringing capital to the industry and investing in research and development,” it said. Bharat is the Sanskrit or Hindi name for India.The Modi government is aggressively trying to capitalize on the rethink underway among global companies on supply chains.Executives are trying to diversify operations beyond China, where they faced obstacles during the pandemic and are threatened by rising tension between Beijing and Washington. As a result, some of the world’s biggest companies, including Apple (AAPL) supplier Foxconn, are expanding their operations significantly in India.Apart from consumer electronics, Modi’s party also wants to promote manufacturing in areas including semiconductors and electric vehicles (EV).“We will support the growth of the automobile industry and its transition to EV manufacturing,” the manifesto said. “We will invest in establishing a nationwide EV charger infrastructure to encourage EV adoption.”<h2>A ‘natural progression’ for Tesla</h2>Tesla’s entry into the world’s fastest growing major economy would be a win for Musk as well.Even though EVs comprise less than 1% of total vehicle sales in India, it should be an attractive destination in the coming years for Tesla, which is struggling with waning enthusiasm in major markets.In the United States, overall electric vehicle sales have flattened out in recent months. China, the world’s largest EV market, is also losing momentum as a result of market saturation and a slowing economy.According to reports earlier this month, Tesla is cutting more than 10% of its global staff of 140,000 over “cost reductions and increasing productivity.”The development comes just after the company reported a year-over-year decline in sales in the first three months of this year, its first such drop since the height of the pandemic four years ago.In the fourth quarter of 2023, Tesla briefly lost its crown as the leader in global EV sales to Chinese automaker BYD. It recaptured the EV sales title from BYD in the first quarter, despite the drop in sales.<h2>As ‘soon as humanly possible’</h2>While demand for EVs has softened in other economies, India aims to have 30% of all private car sales be electric by 2030.Last year, Musk said his company is looking to invest in India “as soon as humanly possible,” following a meeting with Modi in New York.The billionaire reiterated his ambitions to make it in the South Asian nation earlier this month, when he said in an X Spaces livestream interview that it is a “natural progression to provide Tesla electric vehicles in India.”Musk’s push into the Indian market has been in the works for years.In 2017, he said Tesla was planning to sell cars in India as soon as that summer. But the plan was delayed because of the company’s efforts to negotiate lower import duties with the Indian government.Musk tweeted in 2021 that Tesla wanted to enter India, “but import duties are the highest in the world by far of any large country.”Tesla had sought to slash the duties, but the Indian government wanted the company to make cars locally before considering any tax breaks.The Modi government has now removed some of those impediments in an effort to make India a manufacturing hub for electric vehicles.Last month, it announced a new policy lowering taxes on some electric cars made by global automakers, if the manufacturer invests at least half a billion dollars in the country and sets up a local plant.India isn’t the only Asian nation where Tesla has plans. The company is also in talks with the Thai government to build a production facility in the country.Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.CNN’s Kunal Sehgal and Clare Duffy contributed to this report.",2024-04-19 09:00:00,Elon Musk is heading to India.

,"Online furniture and home furnishings seller Wayfair is set to open its first-ever namesake store next month, the company announced  Thursday.The large-format store, clocking in at 150,000 square feet and located in Edens Plaza in Wilmette, Illinois, will open to shoppers on May 23. It will also feature an onsite restaurant called “The Porch,” the company said, taking a page out of Ikea’s store setup.Although this will be the first brick-and-mortar location for the Wayfair brand, the company has tinkered with opening test stores for some of its other owned brands, including Joss & Main and AllModern.But the move to expand its flagship Wayfair brands into physical stores comes as it struggles with sluggish sales and an increased need for spending on advertising.“Wayfair’s online business has been tremendously successful at generating sales. Unfortunately, it is not profitable because of the amount of marketing that has to be done to attract and retain customers,” said Neil Saunders, retail industry analyst and managing director at GlobalData Retail.Furniture stores need to always be advertising, Saunders added, because people generally don’t buy furniture very often. Wayfair constantly needs to remind customers that it even exists, as a result.But it’s not just the big advertising spend that’s hobbling the company. Sales are down, too.Wayfair posted a 1.8% drop in its annual sales in 2023, to $12 billion, and a net loss for the year. In January, the retailer laid off 1,650 workers, or 13% of its global workforce. This follows a separate round of layoffs in 2023 that eliminated 1,750 jobs.Its CEO, Niraj Shah, who went viral for telling his employees that they should be working longer hours as well as blending work with their personal lives, explained the company’s hardships in an open letter. Wayfair “went overboard in hiring during a strong economic period,” he wrote, referencing the pandemic lockdowns when online shopping spiked as homebound families spruced up their apartments, houses and backyards, sparking a “dramatic surge” in demand that doubled Wayfair’s sales to $18 billion.But, coming out of the pandemic, and with persistent inflation, buying highly discretionary big-ticket items like furniture quickly dropped off the shopping list for more budget-conscious consumers.Saunders said the new store could help drive sales and give Wayfair a more visible presence in the market that will “throw a halo around the online operation.”“It’s basically a recognition by Wayfair that people shop in an omnichannel way, and like to visit stores as well as use online. This is particularly important in furniture and finishings where people like to see and try out products before buying,” Saunders said.Whether the store makes a difference to Wayfair’s financials remains to be seen. “If this store is successful then it could be the start of wider physical expansion for Wayfair,” Saunders said.CNN’s Jordan Valinsky and Samantha Delouya contributed to this story.",2024-04-18 14:31:00,Wayfair is opening its first-ever physical furniture store,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/18/business/wayfair-first-namesake-store/index.html
Oliver Darcy,"Editor’s Note: A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.In the early stages of life, a key metric is growth. As children age, their parents measure precisely how much they are flourishing in size, using charts to keep close eyes on and document the journey.But when children mature into young adults, physical growth is no longer the barometer used to judge progress. Other metrics come into play.Netflix is trying to persuade Wall Street that it is now all grown up. After squeezing out millions of additional subscribers via its password sharing crackdown and through the introduction of cheaper advertiser-supported plans, the streamer knows that its growth spurts are coming to an end — and now it wants investors to stop obsessing over those pesky membership numbers and instead focus on other metrics.“In our early days, when we had little revenue or profit, membership growth was a strong indicator of our future potential,” Netflix told shareholders Thursday as it reported quarterly earnings. “But now we’re generating very substantial profit and free cash flow. We are also developing new revenue streams like advertising and our extra member feature, so memberships are just one component of our growth.”To that end, Netflix said that it will no longer report quarterly subscriber numbers, starting in 2025. Alas, the metric that Wall Street has forever judged Netflix on — the metric that prompted legacy media companies to burn endless piles of cash in their bids to compete with the streamer — will be retired. It’s going the way of the woolly mammoth, Netflix said. Goodbye!The decision to shut off transparency on the metric represents a significant turning point in the streaming revolution. For years, Netflix has prided itself on being extraordinarily transparent. Now it is aiming to hold its cards closer to its chest. And given that streaming giant is the trendsetter in the space, one could expect that other media companies will be inspired by the company’s move and also opt to cease reporting such data.To be fair, what Netflix is saying isn’t necessarily off base either. As the company shifts its business model away from subscriptions and toward advertising and other revenue streams, it makes sense to consider how much time users are spending on the service. The more content a user consumes on Netflix, the more likely they are to continue paying for the service, and the more money Netflix then makes from that single subscriber (particularly if they are in an advertiser-supported tier).“We’re focused on revenue and operating margin as our primary financial metrics — and engagement (i.e. time spent) as our best proxy for customer satisfaction,” Netflix underscored in its letter to shareholders.Regardless, less transparency in an already opaque industry is not ideal. The walled garden of streaming already lacks the same detailed viewership data that Nielsen collects on linear television broadcasters. Now, visibility into the streaming world will get even dimmer. Instead, Netflix said it will “announce major subscriber milestones” as it crosses them. But that’s a very general statement and it is unclear what the company defines as a milestone.The announcement from Netflix managed to overshadow its otherwise stellar quarter. The company handily beat exceptions and added a staggering 9.3 million subscribers, meaning it now boasts nearly 270 million in total. Netflix also beat analyst expectations on both earnings and revenue.But it wasn’t all good news. Netflix forecasted its subscriber growth to be lower in quarter two, chalking it up to “typical seasonality.” That led the stock to slide nearly 5% in after-hours trading.Whether “typical seasonality” is solely to blame, or whether the streamer is simply starting to hit a ceiling, is hard to tell. Perhaps it is a mix of both. Whatever the cause, the stock sliding on the less-than-ideal outlook is a prime example of why Netflix wants Wall Street to stop focusing on its subscriber numbers.

Ramishah Maruf,"Hyundai said on Thursday it paused advertising on X, formerly known as Twitter, a day after an ad from the automaker reportedly appeared adjacent to an antisemitic and pro-Hitler post on the social media site.On Wednesday, user Nancy Levine Stearns posted screenshots of a paid Hyundai ad above an antisemitic post from a verified “premium” account. The account posts tweets that deny the Holocaust and perpetuate antisemitic rhetoric.In response to a CNN inquiry that included Stearns’ post, a spokesperson for Hyundai replied: “We have paused our ads on X and are speaking to X directly about brand safety to ensure this issue is addressed.”Hyundai is the latest prominent company to pause advertising on X, after its owner Elon Musk publicly embraced an antisemitic theory favored by white supremacists in 2023.NBC News first reported the pause.X has suspended the antisemitic account that was adjacent to the ad, the head of business operations at X, Joe Benarroch, said in an email to CNN. The account’s bio also had antisemitic tropes, Benarroch said.However, as of Friday morning, the user’s account was still up. X temporarily suspended the account Thursday night because the user’s bio contained antisemitic tropes, but the user returned to the platform, writing in the bio, “Twitter forced me to delete my bio because it stated: END JEWISH SUPREMACY”. The account is under review.Benarroch said Hyundai has been running a Corporate level account on X, focused on climate change ads aimed at reaching policy makers. He said the company’s ad agency did not activate Brand Safety settings, and the campaign took place without X’s direct sales team. X’s Brand Safety settings allow advertisers to make sure their ads aren’t running alongside posts that companies might find distasteful.“As a result one ad ran adjacent to a post – that X has since acted on and even suspended the account,” Benarroch said in an email to CNN.But many of these accounts still exist, according to NBC News. An analysis from the outlet this week found 150 verified premium accounts that have “posted or amplified pro-Nazi content.”X News called the report “gotcha articles” and claimed NBC did not disclose the full extent of its research to the site.Musk in November 2023 agreed with a post on X that claimed that Jewish communities push “hatred against Whites,” calling it the “actual truth.”Musk apologized for the post later that month but told advertisers who halted their spending on X over concerns about antisemitic content to “go f**k” themselves.After visiting Auschwitz in January, he said X has less antisemitic content than other social media platforms, but conceded that he wasn’t aware until recently that antisemitism was a pervasive problem in the United States.CNN’s Clare Duffy contributed to this report.",2024-04-19 09:58:00,Hyundai is the latest brand to pause advertising on X due to antisemitism,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/18/business/hyundai-pause-advertising-x-antisemitism/index.html
,"Caitlyn Pratt is an avid Aldi shopper, so much so that she crosses state lines a few times a month, driving 45 minutes from her home in Heavener, Oklahoma to the nearest Aldi in neighboring Arkansas.The distance doesn’t bother her if it means she can do these three things: Stay within budget for her household needs, skip Walmart, and most importantly, indulge in a fun little affordable treasure hunt in a place that Aldi superfans have dubbed the “aisle of shame.”Aldi, a privately-held German discount grocer that touts a Walmart-like sales pitch of everyday low prices, has operated in the US since 1976 when it opened its first store in Iowa. It operates more than 2,000 stores nationwide and 12,000 stores worldwide.Inside every Aldi store is a single aisle of merchandise that mostly has nothing to do with groceries. The retailer describes it as “a rotating assortment of specialty items available for a very limited time.” It could be anything from a garden hammock to a furry sweater for your pooch. The prices are startling, with many of these items costing just a few bucks.Aldi calls it the “Aldi Finds” aisle. Superfans have a more colorful alternative for it – the “aisle of shame.”Novice shoppers to the grocery chain might think it’s a mishmash of randomly selected stuff shoved into the shelves, sometimes spilling onto the floor after a wave of customers descend on a Wednesday morning and make a beeline for the one item that week that went viral. But often the products are carefully selected and seasonally timed to meet what customers are already looking for.The Wednesday rush can often be pinned on die-hard Aldi shoppers, 3 million of whom are members of the very active Aldi Aisle of Shame Facebook page and frequently post about their latest aisle of shame hauls.Pratt is one of them. She happily admits that the aisle of shame is as much a catalyst for her as Aldi’s famously low prices – which research has found can be as much as 15% cheaper than a Walmart in some markets – to get her to make those monthly 42-mile Aldi trips in her car.<h2>Temptation alley</h2>Pratt, who’s been an Aldi shopper for more than 12 years, likes Aldi so much she avoids going to a Walmart supercenter just 15 minutes from her home “at all costs.”“When you go into a Walmart and you’re looking for a can of green beans, you have 18 different options. In Aldi, there’s one, and maybe one other. I can get in and out and get exactly what I need without spending forever in there,” Pratt said.When she’s done with her grocery list, she hits the middle aisle to scoop up a bargain or two on a variety of other items.Aldi Finds might include anything from shovels, plastic garden gnomes, patio rugs, deck furniture (depending on the season), to candles, bedding sets, greeting cards, sneakers, lighting fixtures, pet beds, clothing, exercise equipment and cookware at startlingly low prices.Some items, such as sneakers, are substitutes for name brands and priced at $13 for a pair.The miscellaneous mix is refreshed weekly, usually on Wednesday. “Fans love our ALDI Finds aisle because it takes the average grocery trip from errand to adventure,” the company said in an email to CNN.Pratt said her region has it’s own tongue-in-cheek descriptor for the aisle.“In the south, we call it the ‘aisle of sh*t,’” she joked. “Because on unnecessary things, I probably spend like $150 at Aldi every time that I go there,” Pratt said. “I get so much sh*t for $150, half of which are not groceries.”Those purchases have included outdoor rugs, patio sets, planters, lanterns, candles, cookware, pillows, pet beds and pet clothing. “When my friends come to my house they don’t even ask me anymore where I’ve got some new things. They know it’s Aldi,” Pratt said.Aldi, describing the process behind stocking the aisle of shame, said a team of trend experts and buyers spot rising product trends and “source the best products at the lowest possible prices.”“It often takes ALDI nine months or less, bringing in relevant items faster than competitors,” it said, and that includes food items, such as a Seafood Boil that it tested through the aisle of shame last summer, and which the company plans to bring back this year.One aisle of shame item – a sparkly $13 wrap dress – had quite a viral moment last fall and was featured across numerous media outlets, including Good Morning America, after shoppers flooded social media with photos of the versatile dress that seemed to complement a variety of body shapes. No word on whether that product will be restocked, however.Britney Henderson, who lives just north of Atlanta, Georgia, recently bought a pair of hanging bamboo pendant lamps from Aldi for $9 each for her bedroom and promptly posted about it on the Aisle of Shame Facebook group.Like Pratt, she shops at Aldi two or three times a month. It’s a 30-minute drive for her but she generally prefers the grocery quality and prices at Aldi versus other discount supermarkets, including Walmart.Before her trips, she updates herself on recent posts on the Aisle of Shame Facebook page.“If something pops up on there and I think, oh my gosh, I’ve got to have it, I try to get to the store as soon as I can. If you don’t, it is gone,” she said, sharing that she was wearing shoes she also bought at Aldi during the interview. One item she couldn’t snag was the viral wrap dress from 2022.Sometimes she tries to avoid the aisle when she’s adamant about sticking to her budget, but it’s a struggle.“I’m almost embarrassed by it,” Henderson said.<h2>A low-cost juggernaut</h2>Aldi is keen to saturate the US landscape – small towns to large cities – with its efficient, no-frills, lowest prices, small-sized hybrid grocery/discount stores. And it poses an increasing competitive threat to other retailers such as Walmart, Target and Costco.“The stores have limited assortments, heavily focused on private label products. Their overall messaging to customers effectively is that “we make things more efficient and curate an assortment for you so that you don’t have to pay all those extra costs,” said John Clear, senior director in the consumer and retail group of global consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal.It’s the perfect positioning for the current state of the US consumer, he said. “It’s a clear and succinct message for the time that we’re in, where customers are stretched both where their wallets are tight and they’re time-poor,” Clear said.The chain checks two boxes for shoppers: Low-priced, good quality affordable groceries and an efficient shopping experience lacking an overwhelming product choice in huge stores, “so it makes it easier for shoppers to get in and out quickly,” he said. It helps that stores have less than a dozen aisles.In March, the company announced plans to expand its footprint by adding another 800 stores nationwide by 2028, on top of the more than 2,300 stores it already has in the US.“Our growth is fueled by our customers, and they are asking for more ALDI stores in their neighborhoods nationwide,” Aldi CEO Jason Hart said in a statement. “With up to 40% savings on groceries, new customers are inspired to try us out, and existing customers keep coming back. “The aisle of shame serves a strategic business purpose as well. Although Aldi declined to disclose annual sales in the US or globally, Clear estimates that 10% to 15% of annual sales, and “several multiples of that” contribute to profit margins just from aisle of shame purchases.“The way I think about that middle aisle is that traditionally customers spent a lot of time shopping the outside of the store, which is frozen, chilled, fresh, freezer,” Clear said, adding that those sections tend to be lower margin areas.“Products like milk and eggs, flour and sugar drive [shopper] frequency because of Aldi’s low prices,” he said. However, stores typically don’t make big profits off of low-margin products unless they sell a lot of them.The Aldi Finds items, combined with Aldi’s own higher priced private label grocery offerings (which make up 80% to 90% of grocery items) like olive oil however, tend to be more profitable.Products in the aisle of shame are profit-boosting additions, Clear said. “It’s plastics and textiles that they import directly from overseas.”“The customers who come in and only buy milk and eggs are not great for Aldi. No one really makes money off of that,” he said. “You have to get that customer who comes in once or twice a week to also pick up some other products. That’s where this aisle of shame fits in and helps Aldi offer its low prices overall.”",2024-04-19 13:03:00,Aldi’s ‘aisle of shame’ is a middle row of goodies that have nothing to do with groceries.

Chris Isidore,"Renee Berry has been working at the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee since 2010, shortly after it opened, long enough to see the majority of her co-workers twice vote against joining the United Auto Workers union. She thinks the third vote taking place this week will be different.“It’s a totally different ball game,” she said. “The atmosphere is different. You see more pro-union than anti-union [workers]. A whole lot of people who were anti-union in the past have switched.”The union vote at the Volkswagen plant will mean more than whether the 4,300 hourly workers in Chattanooga are members of the UAW or not. It could be the start of a revolution in the US auto industry, which has not seen a new automaker unionize in nearly 50 years.Today the industry is split almost evenly between unionized and nonunion workers at US auto factories, and the unionization of a factory in Tennessee would give unions a high profile beachhead in the South, which has long been difficult territory for unions to organize.Because the plant is in Tennessee, and not Michigan or Pennsylvania or some more unionized northern state, the results could be close, as they were in the two previous votes in 2014 and 2019 at the plant. The latest vote saw 52% decide against joining the union.The plant has more than doubled its workforce from the 1,600 eligible to vote in the 2019 election. Supporters of the union are hoping that many of the new, younger workers will be more union-friendly than the workers in 2019.Opponents of the union among rank-and-file are hoping the union will lose out again, although they admit they’re not sure that will happen this time.“I don’t know. It could go either way,” said Darrell Belcher, who also started work soon after the plant opened. “The last time we were concerned it would swing [to the union]. I’m hearing people say there are more people against it than people think.”<h2>UAW deal after auto strike influences vote</h2>But it’s not just that there are more, and different workers at the Volkswagen plant than last time.Previous votes were held after the union had negotiated concession contracts in which members at the unionized automakers had given up past gains, and in the wake of a corruption scandal that would land two former union presidents in prison.This time the UAW is coming in a winner, after negotiating record wage increases at GM, Ford and Stellantis. The unprecedented simultaneous strike at all three automakers won immediate raises of at least 11% and pay increases of more than 30% over the life of the contract that runs through April 2028.Even though Volkswagen quickly matched the UAW’s contracts with the Big Three with an 11% raise of its own, Berry said their contract in Chattanooga is still not as good as the UAW deals, and people know that.“It opened up a lot of people’s eyes. That had a big impact,” Berry said.“People here were rooting for [the strikers],” said Kelcey Smith, another union supporter who has been at VW for about a year. “It [the strike and the deal that followed] showed what you can achieve.”Smith said he has never had a union-represented job, and despite his support for the union effort, it doesn’t mean that he holds anything against the company. “I love my job. I enjoy being an employee here,” he said.But he said he wants the better pay and benefits he sees workers at unionized auto plants are getting, in order to provide more for his family.Volkswagen said the average worker in its plant makes about $60,000 a year before bonuses and benefits. Production workers working under the recent UAW contract now make about $36 an hour, or about $75,000 a year before overtime, bonuses and benefits.“I want to be financially safe, to give them a cushion in life,” Smith said. “I want to do what I can to make things better for them.”But Belcher said he’s worried what will happen to his job if the union were to win the pay its supporters at the plant are promising they’ll achieve after a UAW win.“In my opinion, if Volkswagen were to agree to something like that, they’d pack up and be gone to Mexico,” he said.<h2>Volkswagen staying neutral</h2>The company said it is neutral in the election, only urging workers to vote however they want. That’s relatively rare in union representation elections, where management often lobbies workers to vote no at mandatory meetings, and sometimes takes action against union organizers. Even union supporters acknowledge that hasn’t happened in this case, however.One thing helping the UAW is that unions have much more clout in Germany than in the United States, and the main Volkswagen union there has a seat on the company’s board. This is also the only VW plant without union representation.The vote is the first of an effort by the UAW to organize workers at 13 nonunion automakers spread across the country, mostly in the South.Another vote, at a Mercedes plant just outside of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, is set to be completed by May 17. And efforts are underway to organize workers at the American plants of eight other foreign automakers beyond VW and Mercedes – BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Mazda, Nissan, Subaru, Toyota, and Volvo, as well as the plants of three US-based electric vehicle makers – Tesla, Rivian and Lucid.Together the US plants of those companies have about 150,000 workers, roughly as many as the three unionized automakers whose workers went on strike last year.Even if the union wins in Chattanooga, it could be an uphill battle to win at the other companies, said Art Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University’s Industrial and Labor Relations school. But it would be an important step in the broader organizing effort, he said. And that could change the dynamics in future auto contract negotiations.“It won’t be like dominoes where the others all fall quickly,” he said. “But it’ll start to build momentum. As you get more plants organized, you have more leverage at the table and you can set an industry [contract] pattern.”<h2>Southern governors worried</h2>Because of the potential for organizing efforts to pick up steam once one plant joins the union, the vote is closely watched by people across the auto industry and the labor movements, as well as by politicians across the South, who have worked hard to attract manufacturers to their states with promises of a union-free work force.“The reality is companies have choices when it comes to where to invest and bring jobs and opportunity. We have worked tirelessly on behalf of our constituents to bring good-paying jobs to our states,” said a letter signed by this week by Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee and five other Southern governors – from Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas – who have nonunion auto plants in their states. “Unionization would certainly put our states’ jobs in jeopardy.”Fewer than 5% of workers belong to unions in those six states, which is less than half the union representation in the seven more northern industrial states where the Big Three have most of their plants.It’s not just Republican governors who are weighing in on the vote. President Joe Biden, who became the first president to visit a picket line during the UAW strike last fall, and who has been endorsed by the UAW, congratulated the Volkswagen workers when they filed for the election last month. But Biden’s ties to the union aren’t playing particularly well among the rank-and-file who will be voting at the Chattanooga plant.“I know a lot of people on the pro side have switched over,” said Corey Linn, a 13-year employee and one of those working against the union. “The biggest argument to make the switch is once they found out that Biden was backing the UAW. He’s not very popular in Tennessee.”Union supporters say they have also heard from co-workers who are afraid that their dues money would go to Biden, even though political donations from unions don’t come from the dues money collected.“You hear all of that, ‘Why are they supporting Biden?’” Berry said.",2024-04-19 15:57:00,Volkswagen workers are voting on whether to join the UAW.

Brian Fung,"TikTok is again facing an imminent threat from Congress.On Wednesday, House Republicans added a hot-button bill that could lead to a nationwide TikTok ban to a wide-ranging foreign aid package intended to help Israel and Ukraine.House Speaker Mike Johnson aims to hold a vote on the aid package as early as Saturday. If approved, it could fast-track what has become the most serious risk to TikTok’s US business since former President Donald Trump first proposed a ban of the popular app in 2020.An earlier version of the TikTok bill sailed through the House in March, but it has become bogged down in the Senate. By including it in the aid package, House Republicans hope to force the Senate to a quick vote on a measure supporters say is necessary to protect Americans’ personal data from the Chinese government.Opponents, including TikTok and a range of civil society groups, have argued the bill risks violating TikTok users’ First Amendment rights.In pressuring Senate colleagues to approve the TikTok bill alongside military equipment for Ukraine, House Republicans are angling to avoid the lengthy regular process that could delay a Senate vote on the app, which has 170 million US users. President Joe Biden has said he would sign the House TikTok bill if it reaches his desk.The latest version of the TikTok bill contains some updates. For example, it sets out a nine-month timeframe for the app’s Chinese parent, ByteDance, to sell the social media company. If it misses the deadline, TikTok would be banned from US app stores.That proposed time limit is longer than the roughly six months proposed in previous legislation. The new bill would also give the president the option to extend the deadline by another 90 days if he determines there’s been progress toward a sale.The changes appear aimed at addressing concerns by some senators that the original six-month deadline was too short. Whether the revisions are enough to gain Senate approval, however, remains unclear, as some leading senators have signaled desires for a slower approach to a TikTok bill.One key senator who was doubtful of the initial House TikTok bill appeared satisfied.“I’m very happy that Speaker Johnson and House leaders incorporated my recommendation to extend the ByteDance divestment period from six months to a year,” said Washington Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, in a statement. “As I’ve said, extending the divestment period is necessary to ensure there is enough time for a new buyer to get a deal done. I support this updated legislation.”For years, US policymakers have expressed fears that TikTok’s links to China through its parent company could allow the Chinese government unauthorized access to TikTok’s US user data. That information could potentially help the Chinese government identify intelligence targets or facilitate disinformation campaigns, they have said. Some other countries such as India have already banned TikTok.TikTok has pushed back strongly against those claims, saying there is no evidence the Chinese government has accessed US user data to date and that the company has taken steps to insulate Americans’ personal information. That includes Project Texas, an initiative that involved moving TikTok’s US user data onto servers controlled and overseen by Oracle, the US technology giant.Some policy experts say a more comprehensive way to deal with TikTok’s potential national security risks would be for Congress to pass a national privacy law that regulates how all businesses and organizations can handle Americans’ personal information.This month, Cantwell and her Republican counterpart in the House, Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, unveiled a proposal that could do just that, breaking a yearslong deadlock over key issues including the scope and reach of a unified, national data privacy standard.",2024-04-19 11:06:00,TikTok is in the hot seat once again in Washington,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/18/tech/tiktok-ban-congress/index.html
Samantha Delouya,"Last year, Netflix made a particularly risky bet by pushing users who share passwords to create their own accounts — but it’s paid off.Netflix, the dominant player in streaming, added more than 9 million subscribers in the first three months of the year, hitting a record high of 269.6 million subscribers.“It added more subscribers than many analysts, myself included, expected,” said eMarketer senior analyst Ross Benes. “This signals that password sharing was even more common than previously thought as Netflix keeps converting freeloader viewers into paid users.”While the subscriber additions topped Wall Street’s estimates, the company still reported a drop in growth from its blowout fourth-quarter report, when Netflix added 13 million subscribers. Netflix announced Thursday that it plans to stop sharing its quarterly subscriber numbers in 2025.The company also reported $9.37 billion in revenue and earnings per share of $5.28 for the first quarter, beating Wall Street’s estimates, according to FactSet.However, the stock, which has been a darling of Wall Street this year, fell in after-hours trading.Much of the company’s past growth and success, analysts say, has come from its old, well-established business model. In recent months, Netflix has made moves to expand and even radically reinvent its business in an effort to juice profit.While streaming competitors like Disney+, Hulu, Max (owned by CNN’s parent company Warner Bros. Discovery) and Peacock work to draw in subscribers with original programming, Netflix has made big bets lately in live sports, video games, and in deals to license other providers’ content — all while transitioning from an advertising-free subscription service to a full-blown ad-supported juggernaut.<h2>Netflix’s reinvention</h2>For Netflix, last month’s Oscars were a disappointment: Though the streaming service led its rivals in nominations, it took home just one award, for best live-action short film. Going forward, the company seems to be moving away from what it was known for: spending its money on developing the big-budget films and TV shows able to win those awards.The company’s first-quarter letter to shareholders laid out several goals to “sustain healthy growth long term,” including: “Improve the variety and quality of our entertainment — with more great TV shows and movies, a stronger slate of games and must-watch live programming.”In recent months, after “Suits” exploded in popularity on the platform, Netflix has indicated that it plans to license more content from other studios. New generations are rediscovering iconic shows from the 90s and the early aughts, like “Seinfeld” and “Sex and the City” after they show up on Netflix’s platform.“They’re getting tons of viewership on both original content and licensed content,” Alicia Reese, an equity analyst who covers Netflix for Wedbush Securities, said. “It’s productive and it’s cheaper for them.”Netflix has also expanded into live and sports programming this year, encroaching on traditional TV’s domain. In February, Netflix aired its first-ever awards show, the Screen Actors’ Guild Awards, and announced a 10-year deal to air “WWE Raw” live, valued at more than $5 billion.In the fight for eyeballs, Netflix has gotten creative, partnering with Rockstar Games’ “Grand Theft Auto,” the wildly popular action-adventure video game franchise, to further push into the video game space.“We’re stoked by the performance of GTA,” Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said in January. “We were in the top mobile game downloads for several weeks, which shows it was not only big for us, but big numbers for mobile gaming in general.”Reese has faith in Netflix’s new direction.“Netflix has that winning formula right now,” she said. “They have a lot of content of various types that keep people using the service at various price points.”<h2>TV with ads, again</h2>Reese said she believes Netflix also has other avenues of growth including the company’s newer advertising-supported subscription tier.The ad tier, which costs $6.99 per month in the United States, significantly less than Netflix’s other subscription plans, has seen explosive growth since it was introduced in late 2022, according to the company. In January, Netflix’s president of advertising, Amy Reinhard, shared that Netflix’s ad-tier had more than 23 million users.While the company did not share an updated number of ad-tier users, in Thursday’s shareholder letter, Netflix said its ads membership grew 65% quarter-over-quarter.Reese said Netflix’s future growth could hinge on its success in the advertising space.In January, Peters said the company aimed to snatch more ad dollars from traditional TV competitors.“We know ad dollars follow engagement. We’ve got the most engaged audience so we believe we’re well positioned to capture some of that ad spend that shifts from linear to streaming,” he said.<h2>Netflix will stop sharing quarterly subscribers</h2>On the company’s earnings call, Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters discussed the company’s decision to stop sharing quarterly paid subscriber numbers beginning in 2025.“We’ve evolved, and we’re going to continue to evolve, developing our revenue model and adding things like advertising and our extra member features. Things that aren’t directly connected to number of members,” he said. “So, each incremental member has a different business impact.”Benes from eMarketer, said Netflix’s decision to stop sharing subscriber numbers allows the company to “quit while its ahead and go out as the world heavyweight champ in subscribers”“Netflix is emphasizing what benefits them,” Benes said. “The password sharing boosts will eventually recede and it will be very difficult to continue to add as many subscribers as they have added in the last few quarters.”",2024-04-19 06:39:00,Netflix cracked down on password sharing.

You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.The 2024 gangbusters rally in stocks has skidded to a screeching halt.The S&P 500 index has fallen 4.6% so far in April, and all three major US indexes are on track for their first negative month since last October. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is on the brink of wiping out its gains since the start of 2024 — it’s up just 0.2% — while the S&P 500 is up 5.1% and the Nasdaq Composite has added 3.9%.CNN’s Fear & Greed Index, which measures seven barometers of market sentiment, closed Thursday at a “fear” reading, down from “greed” a month ago.Behind the turmoil? Strong economic data and sticky inflation have led Wall Street to push back its expectations for when the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates. A boost to oil prices from rising tension in the Middle East hasn’t helped.Data released this month showed that inflation remains stubbornly above the Fed’s 2% target. Employers added a stunning 303,000 jobs in March, blowing past expectations. Spending at US retailers rose for the second consecutive month, highlighting the US consumers’ resilience even with rates perched at a 23-year high.Then, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday that rate cuts will likely come later than expected and that the central bank will need to see more signs of moderating inflation before pivoting.Traders now project that the Fed will begin easing rates in July or September, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Investors earlier this year expected as many as six rate cuts in 2024, starting in March.“We believe investors should prepare for a higher-for-longer regime when it comes to both inflation and interest rates,” wrote Michael Landsberg, chief investment officer at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management, in a Thursday note.The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday upgraded its forecast for American economic growth this year but warned that inflation will be tough to tamp down. While the US will be a key driver of global growth, its economy is “overheated,” the organization said.“This calls for a cautious and gradual approach to (monetary) easing by the Federal Reserve,” IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas wrote in a blog post accompanying the agency’s outlook.Bond yields have spiked this week as investors wager that rates will remain elevated for longer than expected. The 10-year US Treasury yield was trading at 4.65% at 3 pm ET on Thursday, according to Tradeweb.Investors had hoped that corporate earnings would help revive the stalled rally, but a strong start to the season hasn’t been enough to excite investors. Roughly 13% of S&P 500 companies have reported quarterly results so far. Blended first-quarter earnings growth, which combines estimates with actual results, is roughly 0.9%, according to FactSet data. Yet, stocks have continued to falter.Adding to Wall Street’s woes are brewing tensions in the Middle East. Iran launched airstrikes at Israel over the weekend in retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike on its embassy compound in Syria earlier this month. Israel carried out a strike inside Iran in response, a US official told CNN Friday. Israel has not commented, while Iranian officials and state-aligned media have so far sought to play down the incident.Oil prices initially spiked higher on reports of the attack on Iran but reversed those gains as the limited nature of the action became apparent.Brent crude futures, the international benchmark, were down 0.4% at $86.80 per barrel by 6.45 am ET, having earlier spiked more than 3%. US crude futures slipped 0.3% to trade at $82.50, also reversing earlier gains. Both contracts have fallen so far this month but are still up about 15% since the start of the year.Investors are searching for safer havens over stocks. Gold futures have risen this month as traders seek protection from geopolitical turmoil and persistent inflation. The most actively-traded gold futures contract settled at $2382.30 a troy ounce on Thursday.Mortgage rates soared this week, breaching the key 7% threshold and extending America’s home affordability crisis, reports my colleague Bryan Mena.The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.10% in the week ending April 18, up from 6.88% the previous week, according to Freddie Mac data released Thursday. A year ago, the average 30-year fixed-rate was 6.39%.Breaching 7% represents a psychological threshold that hadn’t yet been crossed this year.Mortgage rates are climbing based on expectations that the Federal Reserve won’t cut interest rates anytime soon. The Fed doesn’t directly set mortgage rates, but its actions do influence them, and persistently hot inflation readings are keeping the Fed on hold.“As rates trend higher, potential homebuyers are deciding whether to buy before rates rise even more or hold off in hopes of decreases later in the year.” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, in a statement.If inflation stalls any further, or even worsens, mortgage rates could climb higher this year.Read more here.Apple is planning to buy more components from Vietnam, underscoring a trend among global tech firms to look beyond China to secure their supply chains, cut costs and open up new markets, reports my colleague Anna Cooban.CEO Tim Cook made the pledge in a meeting with Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh in Hanoi Tuesday, according to a statement by Vietnam’s government.Apple (AAPL) has already spent almost $16 billion through its supply chain in the country since 2019, the government quoted Cook as saying.

Samantha Delouya,"Not even a beer at the movies is spared from shrinkflation, alleges a lawsuit against Cinemark. And one man is spearheading the fight against what he considers false advertising on his beer pour.The proposed class-action suit, filed this week in a Texas federal court, claims that the theater chain’s 24-ounce drink cups can only hold a maximum of 22 ounces, purposely misleading customers.According to the lawsuit, the lead plaintiff, Shane Waldrop, ordered a 24-ounce beer from a Texas Cinemark theater on Valentine’s Day this year and observed that the 24-ounce container did not seem large enough to hold 24 ounces of liquid. Waldrop then took the container home and measured it for himself, finding it only held 22 ounces, according to the lawsuit.“This lawsuit is another example of consumers unwittingly overpaying for a supposed benefit they are not receiving,” Jarrett Ellzey, one of Waldrop’s attorneys said in a statement to CNN. “While two ounces may seem inconsequential to the seller, the bottom line is the buyer is not getting what he’s promised by the seller.”The lawsuit claims Cinemark’s false advertising violates both state and federal laws.CNN did not independently verify the size of Cinemark’s 24-ounce cups, and Cinemark did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.<h2>Smaller cups, bigger bills</h2>Concessions are a major part of a movie theater’s business. For Cinemark’s most recent reported quarter, concession revenue climbed to $243 million, while admissions revenue was $322.2 million.Rising prices seem to have boosted that revenue: Cinemark reported concession revenue for 2023 exceeded revenue in 2019 by 3%, even though movie attendance was 25% lower.Waldrop’s lawsuit claims some of that revenue came through shortchanging customers. A 20-ounce drink at the Plano, Texas, Cinemark theater Waldrop visited costs $7.80 pre-tax, while a 24-ounce drink costs just $1 more, at $8.80.“The 24 oz drink should provide a deal for consumers over the 20 oz drink’s price: $0.37 per ounce vs. $0.39 per ounce,” the lawsuit said. “But due to the actual volume of 22 oz available in the “24 oz” drink, the price is $0.40 per ounce making the larger drink more expensive per ounce, which is not a deal at all.”<h2>The ‘shrinkflation’ trend</h2>During times of high inflation, some companies reduce the size of their products to cut costs rather than hiking prices. The practice, known as “shrinkflation,” has been in the spotlight recently as some packaged food brands faced accusations of quietly engaging in the practice.OREO Double Stuf Chocolate Sandwich Cookies saw a 6% decrease in size by weight from January 2019 to October 2023, according to a report from Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. Bob Casey in December, using Labor Department data.“Consumers are tired of not getting value for their hard-earned money while corporations get a windfall for providing an underperforming product or, as in this case, an incomplete product,” Ellzey said. “Though often misunderstood, class actions function as a device for changing business bad practices like this.”- CNN’s Bryan Mena contributed to reporting.",2024-04-19 17:39:00,"Your movie theater may be shortchanging your drinks, a lawsuit alleges",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/19/business/cinemark-drink-lawsuit/index.html
Chris Isidore,"Hourly workers at Volkswagen’s plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee overwhelming voted to join the United Auto Workers late Friday, a major breakthrough in the union’s effort to organize workers at plants nationwide.Shortly after 11 pm ET on Friday the National Labor Relations Board, the federal body that oversees such votes, announced that 73% of the 3,600 workers at the plant who cast ballots had voted in favor of joining the union. There was an 84% turnout among eligible voters.“This election is big,” said Kelcey Smith, a worker in the paint department at Volkswagen, in a UAW statement. “This is the time; this is the place. Southern workers are ready to stand up and win a better life.”There are roughly 150,000 workers at nonunion auto plants in the United States today, roughly the same number as at the American plants of the three unionized automakers – Gener﻿al Motors, Ford and Stellantis. If the union can win the right to represent workers across the broad swath of the nonunion auto plants, it could increase their leverage in future contract negotiations.The UAW’s victory could also provide a high-profile beachhead for unions in Southern states, which have a much lower level of union representation among workers than in Northern industrial states. Most of the nonunion auto plants are spread across the south.The union has announced an effort to represent workers at not only Volkswagen, but also nine other foreign automakers with American plants – BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Mazda, Mercedes, Nissan, Subaru, Toyota and Volvo. It has already filed to have another election at the Mercedes plant in Vance, Alabama, just outside of Tuscaloosa. That vote is set to take place next month and be concluded on May 17.It is also seeking to represent workers at three American automakers making electric vehicles – Tesla, Rivian and Lucid. But it has yet to file to hold votes at those American EV makers or at the American plants of the eight foreign automakers other than Volkswagen and Mercedes.Unlike many employers who conduct campaigns against union membership when faced with an organizing effort, Volkswagen had remained neutral in this campaign. Its statement once the vote was announced was similarly even-handed, stating only the vote results and that “We will await certification of the results by the NLRB. Volkswagen thanks its Chattanooga workers for voting in this election.”That certification is expected to come within five days if Volkswagen does not file objections to the vote, according to the NLRB. The agency said the company is expected to begin bargaining in good faith with the union at that time.One reason the company was more neutral than many employers facing a union vote is the strength of unions in its home country of Germany. The main union for its plants there has a seat on the company’s board.<h2>Auto strikes and contracts helped win vote</h2>The union’s organizing efforts follow a six-week strike against the three unionized automakers last fall, which won record pay increases for UAW members at the three companies. They received immediate raises of at least 11% and pay increases totaling more than 30% over the life of the contract, which runs through April of 2028.Many of the nonunion automakers, including Volkswagen, gave their workers similar raises in the wake of the UAW contracts. But the workers at the nonunion plants generally earn less than their counterparts at the unionized automakers.The average worker in Volkswagen’s Chattanooga plant makes about $60,000 a year before bonuses and benefits, according to the company. Production workers working under the recent UAW contract now make about $36 an hour, or about $75,000 a year before overtime, bonuses and benefits.Volkswagen once before had had an American plant where workers were represented by the UAW, in Pennsylvania. But that plant closed in 1988, in the face of weak American sales by Volkswagen. And the UAW has had little success winning the right to represent nonunion auto workers since then, until Friday’s vote.But the union’s effort had been opposed by a coalition of six southern Republican governors who have nonunion auto plants in their states.The six, including Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee as well as the governors of Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas, signed a letter this week arguing those nonunion jobs would be at risk if the union won Friday’s vote.“The reality is companies have choices when it comes to where to invest and bring jobs and opportunity. We have worked tirelessly on behalf of our constituents to bring good-paying jobs to our states,” said the letter. “Unionization would certainly put our states’ jobs in jeopardy.”But the vote represents a run of success by the nation’s unions, which won pay increases of 10% or more for nearly a million union members last year, according to an analysis by CNN. Strikes were at a decade high in 2023, and organizing activity also increased.Friday’s vote results were praised by the AFL-CIO, the main federation of unions in the country.“This victory sends a powerful message to corporate interests everywhere: Workers will no longer tolerate exploitation and mistreatment,” said the AFL-CIO’s statement. “Whether it’s autoworkers in Tennessee, film crews in Hollywood, hotel workers in Las Vegas or baristas at the local coffee shop, when working people stand together in solidarity, we have the power to enact meaningful change and usher in a brighter future for all.”This story has been updated with additional context and developments.",2024-04-19 23:46:00,"Volkswagen workers vote overwhelmingly to join the UAW, giving the union a groundbreaking win",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/19/business/volkswagen-uaw-vote/index.html
Ramishah Maruf,"This year’s musical performer at the Formula 1 United States Grand Prix in Austin, Texas, is so big, Circuit of the Americas (COTA) is offering to buy “early bird” tickets back from buyers and pay ticket holders an extra $50.Similar to a music festival, the Grand Prix has artists perform before the race. That’s usually all pretty standard, but whoever is chosen is so high-profile that many fans believe COTA can turn a bigger profit by reselling tickets at higher prices than the initial $299 fee.The identity of the musical guest, meanwhile, remains a mystery.“Taylor (Swift) was here a few years ago, and I’ll say this is the biggest we’ve had since then,” COTA founding partner Bobby Epstein told CNN on Friday.Britney Spears, Bruno Mars and Billy Joel are just some of the stars who have performed at the Grand Prix in Austin.COTA will announce the entertainment lineup on April 29, and early bird buyers have until May 6 to sell back their ticket for $350.But fans commenting on the official COTA page call the company scalpers for their own event’s tickets. Others say they could resell their tickets through a third party themselves for a much higher profit than $50.“I don’t think anyone’s going to want to sell their tickets (once the lineup is announced),” Epstein said. After the backlash, Epstein told CNN that he expects COTA to raise the price of the buyback.“It just illustrates that (early bird buyers) got a really good value on their purchase and hopefully, they’ll be there for us again in the future,” Epstein said.The offer was for any general admission three-day weekend grounds pass.Epstein said COTA sold more than 10,000 early bird general admission ground passes. He suggested the limited number of general admission tickets that will be released after the announcement of the artist will still be priced below $400. Last year’s general admission price was around $475.The Grand Prix runs from October 18-20.General admission seating is among the most basic options for a race known for its glitz and glamour. Private air-conditioned suites and club seats run into the thousands.“It’s not about buying back your ticket and making a profit on it at all,” Epstein said. “It was about just demonstrating the value that we see in our tickets and that we appreciate that those buyers saw.”",2024-04-20 03:00:00,"US Grand Prix organizers promised a star performer.

Alli Rosenbloom,"Ryan Reynolds is honoring his friend Michael J. Fox for a special occasion.Fox was named one of Time Magazine’s 100 most influential people on Wednesday, for which Reynolds wrote a moving passage about the impact that Fox has had on his family and others.In the blurb, Reynolds wrote that he knows Fox “pretty damn well,” adding that “he’s funny. He’s warm. He’s handsome and intensely smart.”“He also falls a lot,” the “Deadpool” star continued. “Not just because he has Parkinson’s. He falls a lot because he’s unafraid to fly.” He went on to write that throughout their 17-year friendship, he’s watched Fox “raise the bar for purpose and passion” for Parkinson’s research.Fox was diagnosed with young-onset Parkinson’s disease in 1991 at age 29. In 2000, the “Back to the Future” actor launched the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research, an organization dedicated to finding a cure for the disease through research and ensuring improved therapies.This week, Reynolds wrote that Fox helped his late father James Reynolds – who had lived with Parkinson’s for nearly 20 years – and millions of others “feel less alone.” James Reynolds died in 2015.Describing Fox as a movie star who “shaped the lives of people all over the planet with a uniquely electric wit and self-aware charm,” Reynolds also shared that after recently watching “Back to the Future” with his 8-year-old daughter, it’s since become her favorite film.“I know how lucky I am to call Mike a friend,” he wrote, adding that his daughter still has “no idea” that her dad knows Marty McFly. “I don’t need to teach my daughter the level of compassion Mike has mastered. Or teach her to tell stories the way Mike tells stories.”“I need to teach her that it’s OK to fall a lot,” Reynolds wrote. “It’s the absolute best way to know you’re flying.”",2024-04-17 15:26:00,"Ryan Reynolds honors Michael J.

Sandra Gonzalez,"Will Smith dusted off his black suit and Ray Bans for a surprise performance at Coachella.The actor and musician made a cameo during J Balvin’s Sunday night set at the music festival, singing his 1997 hit “Men in Black” from the film of the same name.Smith, who starred in three “Men in Black” movies, showed up toward the end of Balvin’s extraterrestrial-themed set, sporting the iconic look that became synonymous with the alien-fighting agents in the film.With green aliens dancing in the background, Smith sang a portion of the catchy tune and resurrected dance moves from the music video. (Balvin’s performance and Smith’s cameo were shown on Coachella’s YouTube livestream.)Fittingly, Smith closed his performance with a reference to the movie, whipping out a memory-erasing neuralyzer and disappearing as quickly as he appeared. This was a performance, however, that attendees and live streamers alike are unlikely to forget.In the “Men in Black” franchise, Smith starred as Agent J, a former NYPD detective who is recruited to serve in a secret organization that deals with all extraterrestrial matters.

I thought it was going to be about the same thing, but then some of you decided, ‘Oh yeah, I’m going to get a shake and dessert.’”He said his accountant called him up concerned about how long the strike was going on.“When the bills started piling up, my accountant called and was like, ‘Is there any way we can dial this back?’” he said.But Carey kept on paying, he said Sunday, because “it was the right thing to do.”“You writers, well not all of you, ‘The Drew Carey Show’ writers — made me a f***ing million. Everybody in this room makes some actor a million. And you deserve all the money you get.”Carey reportedly spent an estimated $1 million on the meals.“Deeply appreciate all the love and thanks. It as [worth] every dime.

Lisa Respers France,"Charlie Puth is a major Swiftie and it appears the admiration may be mutual.Taylor Swift shouts out her fellow singer-songwriter in the title track on her new album, “The Tortured Poets Department.”“You smoked then ate seven bars of chocolate,” she sings in the love song. “We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist.”Puth, known for such hits as “One Call Away” and singing the hook on Wiz Khalifa’s “See You Again, is well-documented in his musical appreciation of Swift.Not only has he been known to cover her songs while in concert, but in 2022 a video of him praising her musicality made the rounds.“Sidebar, this has nothing to do with anything, but Taylor Swift is the queen of these types of chords,” he told attendees at his New York City concert as he played her song, “Teardrops on My Guitar.”Part of the fun of any Swift album release is dissecting her lyrics and the Puth reference has stirred the Swifties.One person posted on X, “Charlie Puth, Underrated Legend. She knows. I know,” joining a cacophony of those co-signing Swift’s apparent endorsement.Still others saw the lyric in a less-flattering light.“Did she call Charlie Puth a flop,” another person posted.Puth and Swift share some connections beyond both being singer-songwriters.His hit 2016 single “We Don’t Talk Anymore” features Swift’s good friend Selena Gomez, who has long denied that she and Puth were ever romantically involved - something he appeared to confirm by tweeting at the time that he and Gomez were just friends.But in 2018, amid speculation that his song “Attention” was about Gomez, Puth told Billboard, “I don’t kiss and tell, but the only way a song like [“We Don’t Talk Anymore”] can come across as real is if there’s something else going on behind the scenes.”“And that’s what was happening [with Gomez].

Brian Lowry,"Zack Snyder has established himself as a gifted visual and action stylist, even in his less satisfying films. Yet the second half of his original space epic, “Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver,” primarily distinguishes the director’s recent knack for separating Netflix from lots of money, with relatively little, at least in terms of recommendable movies, to show for it.Given Snyder’s loyal fan base, earned (and mostly deserved) for his work on the DC universe and before that “300,” the relationship surely possesses intangible value to a subscription streaming service. Moreover, Snyder has indicated that he’s not done with the “Rebel Moon” franchise, although given the expense and scale of these films, Netflix will likely need to have a long talk with its algorithm before signing up for more.Accentuating the positive, after the long set-up that was “Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire,” the second movie moves faster, culminating with a sprawling battle. As it happens, the film’s connection to “The Seven Samurai” and its English-language variant “The Magnificent Seven” feels even more conspicuous and overt, including an extended sequence during which the recruited band of warriors train the village of farmers for the showdown to come.Perhaps inevitably, those preliminaries become a trifle tedious – including a section devoted to farming in slow motion – a byproduct of having more than four hours to tell what’s ultimately a fairly simple story, other than keeping track of the space-opera-style names. The two-part format also allows time for the combatants to explain why they’re in this fight, outlining their motivations for revenge while bonding with the local residents, which adds a tad more narrative heft when they finally tackle those overwhelming odds.Ultimately, “Rebel Moon’s” warriors remain more visually striking than emotionally engaging, starting with Kora (Sofia Boutella), who fled the evil empire to take refuge in this small farming outpost, burdened by guilt and a desire to atone for her past. She’s again flanked by the puppy-eyed Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) and the warriors they recruited, while given a chance for a rematch against Admiral Noble (Ed Skrein), who improbably survived their first encounter, bearing the scar to prove it.Wearing a lot of hats, Snyder (who produced the movie, shares script credit with two others and serves as the cinematographer) gets to demonstrate what he does best thanks to the prolonged nature of the climactic fight, and its muscular in the execution. Alas, the characters and dialogue remain clunky, which shouldn’t be surprising given how derivative almost every beat of this is, down to the robot voiced by Anthony Hopkins.Snyder has now delivered Netflix two genre mashups – the other being “Army of the Dead” – while capitalizing on the fan-driven demand for his “Snyder cut” of “Justice League” that elevated him to a sort-of cult-hero status.Only Netflix can judge whether that avid following, and this opulent visit to “Rebel Moon,” warrants further exploration. Strictly on the merits, though, after “Part Two” it feels like time to move on to different, if not necessarily greener, pastures.“Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver” premieres April 19 on Netflix.",2024-04-19 10:38:00,‘Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver’ builds on the original without leaving much of a mark,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/19/entertainment/rebel-moon-part-two-the-scargiver-review-zack-snyder/index.html

Dan Heching,"EGOT-winner Barbra Streisand was moved to make new music for an upcoming television series that both examines history and sheds light on an issue that persists in the present day.The recent SAG life achievement award recipient has recorded a new song, titled “Love Will Survive,” to be featured in next month’s Peacock series “The Tattooist of Auschwitz,” the streamer announced Wednesday.“Because of the rise in antisemitism around the world today, I wanted to sing ‘Love Will Survive’ in the context of this series, as a way of remembering the six-million souls who were lost less than 80 years ago,” Streisand said in a statement. “And also to say that even in the darkest of times, the power of love can triumph and endure.”The song was composed by Oscar-winner Hans Zimmer in collaboration with Kara Talve and Walter Afanasieff.

Brian Lowry,"A dual attempt to breathe life into the vampire and haunted-house genres, “Abigail” could have been called “Don’t Tell Mom the Kid I’m Babysitting’s Dead.” The simple premise, however, turns into an effective little horror movie, a bit strained toward the end, but until then a clever and inventive take on six people literally just trying to make it through the night.Of course, the child vampire has a well-established history, including the creepy Swedish film “Let the Right One In” and an American remake, “Let Me In.” Universal has also sought to continue wringing fresh blood out of its monster properties, giving rise to a mixed bag that includes “Renfield” and “The Last Voyage of the Demeter.”“Abigail” owes perhaps a more pertinent debt to the “Scream” franchise, which happens to be under the creative stewardship of the directing team behind this movie, Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, here working from a screenplay by Stephen Shields and Guy Busick. In addition, they’re reunited with “Scream” star Melissa Barrera, whose political comments prompted her split from that franchise, heading a cast that includes Angus Cloud, the late actor best known for “Euphoria.”Barrera and Cloud are joined by Dan Stevens, Kathryn Newton, Kevin Durand and William Catlett as the team of nameless crooks thrown together to kidnap a 12-year-old girl, a ballerina given the code name Tiny Dancer, a.k.a. Abigail (Alisha Weir, who played another unusual kid – if a less bloodthirsty one – in Netflix’s “Matilda the Musical”).The promised payoff from their handler (Giancarlo Esposito) is a $50-million ransom, to be extracted from the child’s wealthy father. All the sextet must do, they’re told, is keep the kid company for 24 hours in a secluded mansion without cellphones to avoid the temptation of making contact with the outside world.Simple enough, until bad things start happening, making the group wonder first who the girl’s father might be, and subsequently how somebody seems to be picking them off in the goriest fashion possible.Although there’s an obvious formula to this sort of fare, the filmmakers do their best to play with that, weaving in some pretty funny (and occasionally ominous) dialogue related to the absurdity of the whole situation. While that eventually leads to at least one wrinkle too many, by then “Abigail” has delivered enough of what audiences expect, plus a few surprises.To the extent that’s accomplished without a whole lot of unnecessary exposition, or excessive rule-breaking in terms of understood parameters of vampire lore, the movie overcomes an idea that frankly looked hard-pressed to be stretched much beyond the two-minute coming attractions.Chalk it up perhaps to modest expectations, but by that measure “Abigail” mostly makes the right steps, and by the time it’s over, that tiny dancer, and her captors, have had a busy day indeed.“Abigail” premieres April 19 in US theaters.

Lisa Respers France,"Nick Offerman’s parents may not want to read this story.During a guest appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” to promote his new film “Civil War,” Offerman told a story from years ago he said his parents didn’t know.“Some friends and I, we can say this now in California, we were smoking marijuana out behind a community theater late one night,” he said. “And some flashlights came along the creek where we were hanging out, and we realized it was police. So we began to tiptoe away, and they gave chase, and we wisely ran.”According to Offerman, the police gave chase and caught up to him and his friends.“It turned out that a restaurant had been robbed of a bunch of cash up the creek,” he said. “And they naturally saw these kids running, and we spent the whole night in jail. And the thing is, we were just these innocent, dumb theater kids, and we were saying, ‘No, we were just out there smoking and talking, officer.’”The police eventually believed them, he said, even though the crew ended up spending the night in jail.It all ended on a funny note, however.“As the sun was coming up, we walked out, and on the front lawn of this sheriff’s station, my friend Greg, who had the one-hitter, the pot-smoking paraphernalia, we said, ‘It’s a bummer you had to throw that in the creek when they were chasing us,’” Offerman said. “He reached into his crotch and pulled it out and was like, ‘You think I’m gonna throw this thing away?’ So we smoked marijuana first thing in the morning in Urbana in front of the sheriff’s station.”The “Parks & Recreation” star got high with a little help from his friends.It wasn’t the only time he went to jail, he shared.Offerman said he and a friend used to shoplift as a joke and he got caught stuffing eight Ronnie Millsap cassettes down his pants.

Elisabeth Buchwald,"Trump Media, the parent company of the former president’s Truth Social, alerted Nasdaq Inc. on Thursday of what the company suspects is illegal activity driving down the price of its shares.In a letter to the exchange, Devin Nunes, the CEO of Trump Media (DJT), laid out what he believes could be deemed “naked” short selling.Naked short selling involves someone selling shares they don’t own or have not borrowed. They will often then try to buy shares at a reduced price to cover themselves. This practice is generally illegal. Whereas legitimate short sellers, people who seek to benefit from declines in the value of a company’s shares, borrow the shares before selling.The letter was made public Friday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Nunes also noted in the letter that shares of the company were on a list the Nasdaq maintains that’s “indicative of unlawful trading activity.”“This is particularly troubling given that “naked” short selling often entails sophisticated market participants profiting at the expense of retail investors,” he said.Representatives from Nasdaq and Trump Media did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The company, which is majority-owned by former President Donald Trump, is down by around 50% from the all-time high it set on March 26, the day after it merged with a blank-check acquisition company to go public.Shares of company have been on a wild ride since.Although the company is still worth billions of dollars, it is struggling to make money and needs cash. Experts have warned investors to be careful if they choose to trade the stock, because the company doesn’t have the fundamentals to back up its sky-high valuation.Trump Media lost $58 million in 2023 and made just $4.1 million in revenue.Shares of the company ended Friday’s session about 9.6% higher.This story has been updated with additional developments and context.CNN’s Nicole Goodkind contributed to this report.",2024-04-19 16:24:00,Trump Media warns Nasdaq of suspected market manipulation,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/19/markets/trump-media-nasdaq-suspected-market-manipulation/index.html

She told Hudson she doesn’t get out much, but when she does she likes to do it up big.Since she’s a widow, Moreno said her date is often her daughter, Fernanda Luisa Gordon, who she was with when she spotted rocker Lenny Kravitz at the party.“I said ‘Let’s go say hello,’” Moreno recalled. “She said ‘Do you know him?” I said ‘No,’ but it’s a party and he was all alone.”The tripple-threat singer, dancer and actress wasn’t prepared for what happened next.“I went to him and I said, ‘Hello, I’m Rita Moreno’ and at that point - you’re not going to believe this - he fell to the floor and he got on his knees and he just went on and on and on about how much he’s admired me all these years and all that kind of stuff,” she said. “But you know I nearly peed my britches.”Moreno said she absolutely did not keep her cool and was “astonished.”In 1962, Moreno became the first Latina to win an Oscar when she when the Academy Award for supporting actress for her performance in the film version of the Broadway musical “West Side Story.”",2024-04-18 14:01:00,Rita Moreno tells a very charming story about meeting Lenny Kravitz,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/18/entertainment/rita-moreno-lenny-kravitz/index.html
Dan Heching,"Dickey Betts, a guitarist and the co-founder of the Allman Brothers Band, has died, according to a family statement shared with CNN on Thursday by his longtime manager.Betts was 80.“It is with profound sadness and heavy hearts that the Betts family announce the peaceful passing of Forrest Richard ‘Dickey’ Betts,” the statement reads. “The legendary performer, songwriter, bandleader and family patriarch passed away earlier today at his home in Osprey, FL., surrounded by his family. Dickey was larger than life, and his loss will be felt world-wide. At this difficult time, the family asks for prayers and respect for their privacy in the coming days. More information will be forthcoming at the appropriate time.”Betts’ manager David Spero told Rolling Stone the guitarist had cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.A native of West Palm Beach, Florida, Betts’ early musical influences included bluegrass, country music and later rock and roll. Credited with helping define the sound and of Southern rock genre of the ’60s and ‘70s, Betts, bass guitarist Berry Oakley, drummers Butch Trucks and Jaimoe joined brothers Gregg and Duane Allman to form the Allman Brothers Band in 1969.Betts wrote and sang on the group’s biggest hit, “Ramblin’ Man.” Initially, he wrote the song and intended for it to be sung by another artist entirely.“I was going to send ‘Ramblin’ Man’ to Johnny Cash,” Betts said in 2020, later adding that he “thought it was a great song for him.”“But everybody liked that song. Even my dad liked the song, before we recorded it or anything. And I’m thinking I’m going to send this to Johnny Cash and see if he wanted to do it,” he continued. “The producer (Johnny Sandlin) said we needed another song for the record and asked if I had anything. I said, ‘Well, I got one but I was going to send it to Nashville for Cash to record.’ He said, ‘Let’s hear it.’ And then, ‘No! we gotta do that.’”Other big Allman Brothers songs written by Betts were “Blue Sky” and “Jessica.”Tragedy struck the group when Duane Allman died in a motorcycle accident in 1971 and Oakley was killed in a motorcycle crash a year after. Betts and Gregg Allman became the band’s leaders, but creative differences and substance abuse in the group caused them to break up and reform multiple times.In 1973, a then-16-year-old Cameron Crowe followed the Allman Brothers Band while they toured for a Rolling Stone cover story, which would eventually provide the inspiration for Crowe’s Oscar-winning 2000 movie, “Almost Famous.” In 2017, Crowe said Billy Crudup’s central rock star character is “a tribute” to Betts.In an email sent to CNN later on Friday, Crowe called Betts “a guitarist for the ages, the musical glue that held together The Allman Brothers Band for many years.”“Dickey’s quiet warmth, and his timeless contribution to American music was a big inspiration for our film,” the filmmaker added.Betts left the Allman Brothers Band in a highly publicized split in the year 2000. While the band continued touring for almost 15 more years and released one additional studio album, Betts toured with his Great Southern group, featuring his son Duane, and released another studio album of new material. Betts retired in 2014.Also on Friday, the Allman Brothers Band released an official statement, writing that Betts’ “extraordinary guitar playing alongside guitarist Duane Allman created a unique dual guitar signature sound that became the signature sound of the genre known as Southern Rock.”“He was passionate in life, be it music, songwriting, fishing, hunting, boating, golf, karate or boxing,” the statement continued. “Dickey was all in on and excelled at anything that caught his attention.”When asked what he loved most about music, Betts told the Sarasota Herald Tribune in 2020 that it was primarily the effect it had on his audience.“I like the crowds mainly, and what the music did for them,” he said. “They got more out of the music than I did. … I just really get a kick out of the audience and how they could just kind of drift away to another world in a concert.”CNN’s Phil Gast contributed to this story.This story has been updated with additional information.",2024-04-18 23:36:00,"Dickey Betts, co-founder of the Allman Brothers Band, dead at 80",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/18/entertainment/dickey-betts-death/index.html

When I came up it was just on every radio station, but I wasn’t conscious of what I was listening to. But I fell in love with Katheryn, this girl from Santa Barbara,” Bloom replied.He continued, saying Perry had parents who were “pastors living on food stamps. We’re not talking glamorous Montecito. It’s the side (of Santa Barbara) that no one knows.”Bloom said Perry also “demands that I evolve, and I feel I do the same for her.”“And that makes for fireworks, pardon the pun,” he said. “But it also makes for a lot of fun and a lot of growth.”The two began dating in 2016. They welcomed a daughter, Daisy Dove, in 2020.Bloom added that he wouldn’t change the relationship for anything.“I wouldn’t change it for anything, even when sometimes it feels like, ‘How do we do this?’ Because we’ve got these two giant careers and lives, and hers is like a universe sometimes,” he said. “But I think I just keep coming back to her and trying to hold her hand and walk her back to the sand pit and be like, we’re just going to build a sandcastle.”",2024-04-19 12:18:00,Orlando Bloom opens up about his life with Katy Perry,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/19/entertainment/orlando-bloom-katy-perry/index.html
Lisa Respers France,"Jane Fonda knows what it feels like to worry about the future.In an exclusive interview with USC Annenberg Media, the Oscar-winning actor and activist, 86, reflected on her six-decade-long career and her efforts to address the climate crisis.That work, she said, helped lift her out of darkness.“Maybe five or six years ago, I was really despondent about the climate situation. I was doing stuff, but I knew I could do a lot more given that I have a platform,” Fonda said. “It was hard for me to even get out of bed, I was so depressed. Then I started Fire Drill Fridays and the minute I started my activism full-on, the depression lifted.”Being an activist helps keep her “hopeful,” she said, despite acknowledging we’re living in a “very dangerous time right now.”“I think that the most dangerous threat facing us is the climate crisis, because if we don’t confront it in time it’s going to be very hard to achieve democracy, equality, anything that we want in a stable society,” she said. “When I decided to devote myself to the climate crisis issue full-time, it was to try to alert people of what’s coming. We have about six years to reduce our fossil fuel emissions.”Fonda’s work as an activist began in earnest back in the 1970s, when her mentor, a Black attorney, offered her some words of wisdom.“I said to him, ‘I think I’m going to not be an actor anymore because it’s too hard for me when I’m working with people who are in a very different situation in the world,’” she recalled. “He said to me, ‘Fonda, the movement has a lot of organizers. We don’t have movie stars. We need movie stars. You should not only keep doing what you’re doing but you got to pay more attention, own it. Own your career, make it work for you as an activist.’”That’s just what she did, thriving as both an activist and as an actress in beloved films, including “9 to 5,” “Coming Home” and “The China Syndrome.”Now Fonda wants others to catch fire for doing good as well.“While I have the opportunity, with every ounce of my being, I want to say to the young people that will read this: please vote and vote with climate in your heart. People are worried about climate, but they don’t bring that into the voting booth with them,” she told the publication. “We have to confront this in order to have a livable future.

Lisa Respers France,"Soulful gospel artist Mandisa, a Grammy-winning singer who got her start as a contestant on “American Idol” in 2006, has died, according to a statement on her verified social media. She was 47.“We can confirm that yesterday Mandisa was found in her home deceased. At this time we do not know the cause of death or any further details,” the post reads. “We ask for your prayers for her family and close knit circle of friends during this incredibly difficult time. Mandisa was a voice of encouragement and truth to people facing life’s challenges all around the world.”Mandisa resided in Nashville, according to The Tennessean. CNN has reached out to her representative for comment.Born Mandisa Lynn Hundley in Citrus Heights, California, she got her start singing in church. Music became an integral part of her life.She studied vocal jazz at American River College in Sacramento, California, before attending Fisk University in Nashville, where she was a member of the famed Fisk University Jubilee singers.She auditioned for “American Idol” in 2005 and ended up a contestant on the fifth season of the singing competition show, which aired in 2006.Even among her fellow competitors, who included Katherine McPhee, Kellie Pickler, Chris Daughtry and eventual season winner Taylor Hicks, Mandisa stood out for her powerful voice and shining spirit.Her elimination from the competition’s top 10 didn’t stop her from pursuing her professional dreams. Mandisa would go on to release her debut album, “True Beauty,” in 2007. It debuted at No. 1 on Billboard’s Top Christian Albums chart and earned Mandisa her first Grammy nominations.Five more albums would follow: “It’s Christmas” in 2008; “Freedom” in 2009; “What If We Were Real” in 2011; “Overcomer” in 2013; and “Out of the Dark” in 2017.“Overcomer” earned her the Grammy for best contemporary Christian music album in 2014.Along with success, there were also some tough times which challenged her faith. According to Mandisa’s website, “After the prayers of a multitude didn’t stop her dearest friend from succumbing to cancer, Mandisa withdrew, wrestled with God and fell into a deep depression.”“To be honest, that’s not how I thought things were going to happen. I was disappointed with God,” she said of the death of her friend Kisha. “I was mad because as I prayed for her, I believed that God was going to heal her. I’m not the kind of person who shakes my fist at the Lord and yells and screams. I just shut down and started turning to food again for comfort.”Mandisa documented her mental health struggles in her 2022 memoir, “Out of the Dark: My Journey Through the Shadows to Find God’s Joy” with the hope of helping others.“I want to encourage the people who may have a loved one who is maybe in the middle of a mental health issue,” she said in an interview shared on Instagram in 2022. “Don’t think that even if your messages are not being responded to that they don’t hear them.”A previous version of this story featured a photo with an incorrect date in the caption.

And I’m holding my crossbody bag,” she said. “The reason I’m doing that is because I had to take my sling off.

Andrea Kane,"In this season of the podcast Chasing Life With Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN’s chief medical correspondent has explored the topic of weight: what it really tells you about your health, why it’s so hard to lose, how the new diet drugs work and its links to menopause (you can listen to the episodes here).Whether you are happy with your size or not, whether you follow a special diet or eat what you want when you want, the basic fact of life — unavoidable, inescapable, non-negotiable — is that we all have to eat. If we are fortunate, it’s usually up to five times a day, every day.How you choose to nourish yourself can make a big difference in how you feel, not only in your body, but about yourself and the world around you.“I had this babysitter who was a chronic dieter,” Dr. Linda Shiue, an internal medicine physician and trained chef, told Gupta on the podcast recently. “She would eat this colorless, aroma-less food and she was sad all the time.”That is not Shiue’s style. She is the first director of culinary medicine at Kaiser Permanente San Francisco. That’s where she founded Thrive Kitchen, a teaching kitchen for patients, so she could do more than just hand out prescriptions for chronic conditions.She wanted to create a place where she could teach her patients to make healthy food taste good. “They think it’s deprivation and, you know, loss of joy and kind of penance even,” said Shiue, who is also the author of “Spicebox Kitchen: Eat Well and Be Healthy with Globally Inspired, Vegetable-Forward Recipe.” “It’s colorless, it’s bland, it has no texture, it has no flavor and — we’re not supposed to enjoy it.”Similar to her cookbook, Shiue’s classes show patients how to use spices and herbs to flavor seasonal cuisine while following an eating pattern that supports health.“As a food lover since birth, and a physician who has seen the negative effects of chronic dieting, I encourage people to reframe their relationship to food as a source of pleasure, cultural connection and well-being, regardless of weight. This can be a hard task given the pro-diet messaging that surrounds us,” Shiue said in an email.What can you do to break out of the diet mindset and really enjoy your food? Shiue has five tips.Food isn’t intrinsically good or evil, so there is no need to feel bad about food choices.“Many of us have experienced shame or guilt around food, and a lot of that is a product of our culture and what the food industry has taught us and what the fashion and whole dieting industries have created,” Shiue   said.“Even though we, as an individual, may not even think that we care that much about that message, it’s reached all of us — it’s in all of our subconscious,” she said. “I think that most people at some point feel like, ‘Oh, I shouldn’t eat that. That’s bad for me. It might affect my weight.’”Shiue wants to help people learn how to stop thinking that way. “There’s no room for shame on the plate,” she said, choosing her language around food carefully.“In diet culture, people talk about ‘cheat’ days (but) I prefer to celebrate ‘treat’ days. Everything in moderation, and that means there is room for the occasional indulgence,” she said.Restrictive diets  are counterproductive because most of us won’t be able to stick to them perfectly and forever.“(S)tudy after study  has proven that the best eating plan is the one which any given individual can stick with — a sustainable lifestyle change,” Shiue said.“Rather than restricting, add more of the foods (that) science shows us are better for our health: lots of plants, legumes and whole grains. This will improve your health even if (you) aren’t eating ‘perfectly’ all the time, and even if you don’t lose weight,” she said.Shiue admitted to not eating perfectly all the time and having a sweet tooth; she said she allows herself to enjoy her favorite treats — just not all the time.Eat intuitively.“That means several things,” said Shiue said. “First, are you actually hungry, or are you feeding an emotional need, such as anxiety, sadness, or fatigue?“How does the food make you feel after you eat? Do you feel comfortably full, or are you feeling stuffed? How is your energy level after eating?” she said. “When you pay attention to these feelings, your body will guide you to making the healthiest food choices for you.”Also, eat mindfully, which Shiue said does not mean meditating over your food.“It means when you’re eating your food, just focus on the pleasure of that,” she said. “Eat slowly. Chew your food. … Also pay attention to when you’ve had enough.”Healthy diets can come from a variety of ethnicities and customs, and they can contain a cornucopia of flavors and ingredients.“A lot of people were taught that quote-unquote ‘cultural food’ … is not healthy,” Shiue said. “People are told, ‘Oh no, no: The food that you eat, that’s why you have diabetes. You have to eat this kind of standard, healthy American diet.’”But she said that many people from different backgrounds either don’t want to switch diets, or they don’t know how or it just doesn’t work out — and, Shiue said, they really don’t have to.“The traditional diet of every culture contains healthy foods, and should be celebrated, with pleasure,” she said.Remind yourself that food is more than a way to simply stay alive.“Nutrition and sustenance — that’s only one small part of food,” Shiue said. “Food is, for me, mainly pleasure. It’s a connection to myself, to my loved ones, to my culture.”She added food is also an expression of love and caring.“Enjoy your food,” she said.We hope these five tips help you enjoy your meals and release the guilt.

Alli Rosenbloom,"Take your seat because Taylor Swift’s “Tortured Poets Department” meeting has officially been called into session and, surprise, it’s a 31-song mega double album.The Grammy-winner first released her highly anticipated 11th studio album on Friday, with the album appearing on Apple Music some time prior to its scheduled midnight release time. At 2 a.m EDT, Swift then surprise-released an additional 15-song album titled “TTPD: The Anthology.”The initial 16-track “Tortured Poets Department” album serves overall as a relaxed and mellow listen on the surface, but if you’re paying attention to the lyrics – as most very thorough Swifties do – you’ll discover a chaotic and complicated stream of consciousness where Swift works through waves of heartbreak, longing, anger and self-reflection.An example among many comes on the album’s 12th track “loml” – which is internet-speak for “love of my life” – in which Swift sings, “I wish I could un-recall how we almost had it all.” After singing the words “love of my life,” at the very end of the song, she concludes, “You’re the loss of my life.”To mark the occasion of the album drop, Swift wrote that the album is “an anthology of new works that reflect events, opinions and sentiments from a fleeting and fatalistic moment in time - one that was both sensational and sorrowful in equal measure” on her verified Instagram page Friday.“This period of the author’s life is now over, the chapter closed and boarded up. There is nothing to avenge, no scores to settle once wounds have healed. And upon further reflection, a good number of them turned out to be self-inflicted,” she wrote. “This writer is of the firm belief that our tears become holy in the form of ink on a page. Once we have spoken our saddest story, we can be free of it. And then all that’s left behind is the tortured poetry.”The songs on which Swift chose to feature collaborators are some of the album’s highlights. The album’s eighth track “Florida!!!” with Florence + the Machine is a gorgeous match of two unique voices blending together, with Florence Welch’s signature plaintive singing style complementing Swift’s vocal range on the melodic track.“Fortnight,” the album’s lead single featuring Post Malone, is a dynamic first track, perhaps the album’s catchiest. “I love you it’s ruining my life,” Swift sings reflectively, with Post Malone’s soft vocals echoing hers.The music video for “Fortnight” will be released at 8 p.m. EDT Friday, according to Swift, who wrote on her Instagram page on Thursday that she’s been “such a huge fan” of Post Malone “because of the writer he is, his musical experimentation and those melodies he creates that just stick in your head forever.”Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner, two of Swift’s frequent songwriting and producing collaborators, are credited as co-writers on a number of songs throughout the album, with Swift being credited as the sole writer on two – “My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys” and “Who’s Afraid of Little Old Me?”The “Anthology” album released later on Friday includes the previously announced exclusive vinyl variant bonus tracks “The Black Dog,” “The Albatross,” “The Bolter” and “The Manuscript” along with numerous other new songs.“The Tortured Poets Department” comes amid Swift’s record-breaking “Eras Tour” and Grammy wins earlier this year, and is on track to more than exceed sales and streaming expectations.“This is probably the most anticipated album ever that I’ve seen in my career,” Tom Poleman, the chief programming officer & president for iHeartRadio, told CNN in a recent interview. “It’s not just a music event, it’s a pop culture event that I think that everybody in America will be talking about and celebrating together.”According to Spotify, the album on Thursday became the most pre-saved album in the music streaming platform’s history.At Spotify’s library pop-up activation event at the Grove in Los Angeles on Thursday, one self-avowed Swiftie told CNN, “I have a feeling that she’s gonna give us everything on this album and I’m really looking forward to it. I will say, I feel like she’s kind of held back a couple of years, so I’m ready for this album for her to tell her whole truth.”In February, Swift announced the album at the Grammys, while accepting the award for best pop vocal album for 2022’s “Midnights.”“It was really a lifeline for me,” Swift said of “Tortured Poets” during a February concert in Melbourne, according to video footage posted to social media.“Just the things I was going through, the things I was writing about,” she said, “it kind of reminded me why songwriting is something that actually gets me through my life.”CNN’s Elizabeth Wagmeister contributed to this story.This story has been updated with additional information.",2024-04-19 11:09:00,Taylor Swift’s surprise double album ‘The Tortured Poets Department’ is daggers wrapped in a lullaby,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/18/entertainment/album-review-taylor-swift-reaction/index.html
Madeline Holcombe,"Fans were waiting on bated breath for the emotional torment they were sure would come from “The Tortured Poets Department,” Taylor Swift’s 11th studio album.And she delivered with a double album.The first release since the end of Swift’s six-year relationship was announced, “The Tortured Poets Department” captured the anger, sadness, longing, and confusion fans love in a good breakup song.She sang about having held her breath since her love left her, her heart breaking when he pretended to put a ring on her wedding finger, and him being the loss of her life – the kind of pain listeners may turn away from in life but sometimes seek out in their music.Experts say it is normal and often helpful to connect with heartbreaking music, and Swift even shared her own philosophy in an Instagram post about the album.“This writer is of the firm belief that our tears become holy in the form of ink on a page,” she said. “Once we have spoken our saddest story, we can be free of it.”If you’ve seen a performance of “All Too Well,” you know that Swifties take great joy in scream singing the most heartbreaking parts.Why does it feel so good? Catharsis and validation, said Arianna Galligher, director of the Gabbe Well-Being Office and of the Stress, Trauma and Resilience (STAR) Program at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.It is beneficial to have an avenue to explore the more painful emotions and to feel like it is OK because other people have and are experiencing them too, she said.Even if you aren’t in the midst of a breakup yourself, tapping back into those emotions from past experiences can help, said Dr. Jaryd Hiser, psychologist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.“We all fall into this trap of avoidance of these emotions,” he said. “To be able to go back to those, think of it as a processing of that time.”That process may lead to more acceptance of those experiences and that it is OK if you never fully feel OK about them, he added.The music may be key in making people, who otherwise wouldn’t feel safe visiting those difficult experiences and emotions, revisit them, Hiser said.“I think of it as being a really easy way into mindfulness,” he said. “If we were able to be mindful all the time, that would be great, but most of us can’t … tap into that.”He likes to work with patients on mindfulness by pairing it with activities they enjoy – because it is a lot easier to stay in the present when you are doing something you like, he said.“Those types of things that can kind of draw us in and let us be with our emotions in that moment,” Hiser added.Swift’s success when it comes to her breakup songs may come from the nuance that she holds in her writing, Galligher said.While there may be grief and loss in her writing, there also tends to be themes of empowerment in her work, she added.In a song of her new album, “Fresh Out the Slammer,” Swift writes about going from “daily disappearing for one glimpse of his smile” to saying that she has learned, she is free, and she is going to take the lessons forward with her.And she doesn’t always follow the trope of the jilted ex with a vindictive break up song either, Galligher said.“A lot of her songs actually bring some balance to the conversation,” she said. “And yes, (some songs) sort of highlight ‘this is why I’m setting a boundary,’ but there are often also lyrics that speak to ‘here’s how I’ve grown and changed and what I’ve learned about myself, and maybe what I would do differently.’“I think that sort of balanced exploration is a healthy model,” Galligher said.Swift even contextualized the album in her Instagram post by saying that the expression of feelings in the songs does not mean that there is still a villain and a hero.“There is nothing to avenge, no scores to settle once wounds have healed. And upon further reflection, a good number of them turned out to be self-inflicted,” she wrote.As comforting, empowering and connecting as breakup songs may be, there can be too much of a good thing, Galligher said.“If we steep in it for too long, it starts to impact our ability to function, and that’s certainly a reason to pause and maybe visit with some other types of music,” she said.Especially if you are struggling to begin with, make sure to check in with loved ones and yourself about how you are coping, Hiser said.  If you notice suicidal ideation, contact your therapist or 988, he added.“But really, I think for most people, music is a conduit to accessing our own emotions and sometimes processing through them,” Galligher said. “Allowing space for those emotions to be present is really important, and music can really help us tap into that.”",2024-04-19 07:11:00,Why everyone is crying to Taylor’s breakup songs,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/19/health/breakup-songs-taylor-swift-wellness/index.html
Megan Thomas,"Taylor Swift and Post Malone are trying to get through a seemingly painful black-and-white era.The music video for “Fortnight,” the lead single off Taylor Swift’s 11th studio album “Tortured Poets Department,” debuted on Friday night. The duet features the two artists in various states of melancholy reflection and despair, set in a dystopian and mostly monochromatic world.The video starts with Swift chained to a matressless iron bed frame in a white observation room. After begrudgingly swallowing a “forget him” capsule given to her by an orderly, Swift wipes her face with a towel, revealing Malone’s facial tattoos on her face in the mirror.“And for a fortnight there we were forever running to you/ Sometimes ask about the weather/ Now you’re in my backyard, turned into good neighbors/ Your wife waters flowers. I wanna kill her,” Swift sings darkly.The two then sit at desks in an office – seemingly the titular “department” – surrounded by masked people in all black, typing while they sing. The video soon cuts to Swift and Malone standing face-to-tattooless-face on a stormy road as papers swirl around them.Swift is then shown strapped to a gurney with a mysterious electrical contraption attached to her head. Playing off her new album title, researchers portrayed by Ethan Hawke and Josh Charles – who appeared together in the 1989 film “Dead Poets Society” – examine Swift.“I’m still laughing from getting to work with the coolest guys on earth, @ethanhawke and @mrjoshcharles (tortured poets, meet your colleagues from down the hall, the dead poets),” Swift wrote Friday on social media about their cameos.Eventually, Swift breaks free. Papers burn, rain falls and the strange yet beautiful video ends with Swift and Malone reaching for each other’s hands as she kneels on top of a phone booth.",2024-04-19 20:40:00,‘Tortured Poets’ meet ‘Dead Poets’ in Taylor Swift’s ‘Fortnight’ video,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/19/entertainment/fortnight-music-video-taylor-swift-post-malone/index.html
Mira Cheng,"Trader Joe’s recalled its Infinite Herbs organic basil on Wednesday after the product was linked to a dozen Salmonella infections in seven states.The product was sold in 2.5-ounce packages between February 1 and April 6 in 29 states and Washington, D.C., the company said.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an alert advising consumers to throw away any Infinite Herbs organic basil purchased from Trader Joe’s and to clean surfaces and items that may have come in contact with the contaminated basil.The CDC said it has received 12 reports of Salmonella infections in seven states tied to the product — one person has been hospitalized and no deaths have been reported. Investigators are still working to identify other potentially contaminated products. The US Food and Drug Administration, CDC and local and state health authorities are investigating the outbreak.Salmonella infection is characterized by symptoms of diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps, according to the CDC. Symptoms develop 6 hours to 6 days after ingestion of the bacteria and most people recover without treatment within 4 to 7 days. People with weakened immune systems, children and the elderly may experience more severe illness that requires treatment or hospitalization, the CDC said.The CDC recommends people call their health-care providers if they have severe Salmonella symptoms such as bloody diarrhea, diarrhea that does not improve for more than three days and signs of dehydration.Consumers can contact Trader Joe’s Customer Relations directly at (626) 599-3817 and report adverse events linked to the product on the FDA MedWatch site.",2024-04-18 13:48:00,Trader Joe’s recalls basil linked to Salmonella infections,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/18/health/trader-joes-basil-recall-salmonella/index.html
Mira Cheng,"The US Environmental Protection Agency designated two widely used “forever chemicals” as hazardous substances under the United States’ Superfund law on Friday.This ruling will allow the EPA to investigate and clean up leaks and spills of these harmful chemicals, according to the official news release. It will also ensure that polluters are charged for the clean-up of contamination involving these chemicals.The two designated chemicals, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), belong to a larger class of per- and polyfluoroalkyl compounds (PFAS) considered “forever chemicals” because they take a long time to break down in the environment and in the human body.This class of chemicals helps repel water and oil and was used in products like Teflon and firefighting foam for decades. While manufacturing was largely phased out due to health concerns, the chemicals can still be found in hundreds of household items and in drinking water systems and are thought to be in the blood of 98% of the human population.The final rule classifies these two chemicals as hazardous substances, meaning that studies have shown that they are a threat to human health and can cause cancer and birth defects. Exposure to “forever chemicals” has been linked to cancers, heart and liver disease and immune and developmental damage to infants and children, according to the news release.“Designating these chemicals under our Superfund authority will allow EPA to address more contaminated sites, take earlier action, and expedite cleanups, all while ensuring polluters pay for the costs to clean up pollution threatening the health of communities,” Michael S. Regan, administrator of the EPA, said in a news release.In addition to the final rule, the EPA issued a separate enforcement policy that emphasizes that the agency will target companies that have contributed significantly to the manufacturing and release of these chemicals into the environment.“For far too long, the unchecked use and disposal of toxic PFAS have wreaked havoc on our planet, contaminating everything from our drinking water to our food supply,” Dr. David Andrews, deputy director of investigations and a senior scientist at the Environmental Working Group, said in a statement. “Urgent action is needed to clean up contaminated sites, eliminate future release of these pollutants and shield people from additional exposure.”Environmentalists say the EPA’s announcement is a good start, but groups like the U.S. PIRG Education Fund and Environment America Research and Policy Center have called on the EPA to ban the entire class of PFAS chemicals. There are more than 12,000 forms of PFAS chemicals in the environment.“No one should have to worry in 2024 about whether their well water, farm produce or even clothing is contaminated with toxic chemicals, but unfortunately that’s the reality for millions of Americans,” Lisa Frank, executive director of Environment America Research and Policy Center’s Washington office, said in a statement. “This announcement is a critical step toward getting PFAS out of our waterways and making polluters pay. Now, we need to turn off the tap on toxic PFAS everywhere.”The EPA said this ruling is part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s larger efforts to safeguard communities from PFAS contamination. The designation comes just weeks after the EPA announced new limits for “forever chemicals” in drinking water in the United States.CNN’s Jen Christensen contributed to this report",2024-04-19 12:50:00,EPA designates two ‘forever chemicals’ as hazardous substances,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/19/health/epa-rules-pfas-hazardous/index.html
Madeline Holcombe,"In the wake of the overturning of Roe v. Wade, more young adults in the United States took pregnancy off the table entirely, new research has shown.In Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization in 2022, the US Supreme Court overturned the 1973 high court decision that gave abortion federal protection. Since then, many states have partially or completely limited access to abortion.In a study that included 113 million people in all four US Census regions, researchers found that since the reversal, both vasectomies and tubal ligations — sometimes called having your tubes tied — increased significantly in people ages 18 to 30.Tubal ligation procedures increased twice as much as vasectomies, according to the study published Friday in JAMA Health Forum.“Findings from this research highlight the indirect effects of Dobbs on the reproductive autonomy of young people,” said lead study author Dr. Jackie Ellison, assistant professor of health policy and management at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health.The “findings also demonstrate how abortion restrictions disproportionately impact women and people who can get pregnant,” she said in an email.The data was examined on a national level, which means it could not take into account the differences in states with stricter abortion restrictions, said Ellison, who is also faculty in the university’s Center for Innovative Research on Gender Health Equity.“The increase likely reflects fear or anxiety among young people about restricted access to abortion and/or contraception,” she added.“In the short term, we need to ensure access to affordable, person-centered contraceptive care. People need access to the full range of contraceptive methods, including permanent contraception,” Ellison said.The study noted that the increase in these procedures involving female anatomy were twice those involving male anatomy, which experts said was not surprising.“Pregnancy impacts the person with the uterus who has to carry the pregnancy to term,” said Dr. Kristen Mark, a professor of sexual health education at the University of Minnesota Medical School. “It makes sense that they would be more likely to take this into their own hands and make this decision.”Mark was not involved in the research.Both the impacts of pregnancy and the responsibilities of parenting often fall largely on the pregnant person, Ellison said.“It may seem obvious, but it’s important to emphasize that cisgender men may not feel the same sense of urgency to undergo vasectomy because they don’t experience the same consequences of unwanted pregnancy,” she added.A big problem is that women and people who can become pregnant often face the pressure both ways: to get the procedure and to avoid it, said Dr. Elisabeth Gordon, a sexual health psychiatrist based in New York City. Gordon did not participate in the research.Many doctors push back when patients, particularly younger people, come in asking for a tubal ligation, Mark said.It’s important that doctors make sure patients understand what goes into their procedures, Gordon said. But once a doctor knows a patient has thoroughly considered the options, they should take them at their word, she added.“There is more questioning when women go into this, and that certainly is rooted in patriarchy,” Gordon said.The pressure to take decisive steps not to get pregnant and the pressure against the very same thing can put people in a position in which their choices are influenced by factors other than what is right for them, Mark said.“Here we’re seeing bodily autonomy being threatened in a different way,” she said.Even though young women are more likely to experience sterilization regret, they need to be trusted and supported in their contraceptive decision-making.More people getting these procedures isn’t inherently concerning, Gordon said.“What I have concerns about is the climate in which these choices are being made,” she said.Vasectomies and tubal ligation are common and relatively safe procedures, but the decision to get them should not be rushed by a feeling of pressure or fear around unintended pregnancy, Mark said.“We have a lot of options available for effective contraceptive methods that are not permanent,” she added.Patients may still decide that permanent contraception is right for them, but Gordon urges them to talk with providers of the procedures first to make sure they understand what is involved, that it’s permanent and that they still need to protect against risks to sexual health.“I would prefer people not feel pressured to have to make this choice,” Gordon said. “I would prefer to have them make it in a supportive environment in which medicine and science and the individual are being put first.”",2024-04-12 12:43:00,"Greater numbers of younger people got permanent contraception after Dobbs decision, study finds",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/12/health/permanent-contraception-dobbs-wellness/index.html
Jacqueline Howard,"The US Food and Drug Administration is warning that dangerous counterfeit versions of Botox have been identified in multiple states, putting the safety of consumers at risk.Some serious symptoms – including blurred vision, difficulty swallowing, shortness of breath, difficulty lifting one’s head and even hospitalizations – have been linked to the use of counterfeit Botox, the FDA said on Tuesday.“These symptoms are similar to those seen when botulinum toxin spreads to other parts of the body,” according to the FDA announcement.The agency announced that it is working closely with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, state health departments and manufacturers to investigate and identify these counterfeit products and remove them from the market.As of Friday, a total of 19 women from nine states — Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Tennessee, and Washington — reported “harmful reactions” after receiving Botox injections from unlicensed or untrained individuals or in places that were not health care settings, such as homes or spas, according to the CDC. The patients were between 25 and 59 years old.Nine of the women were hospitalized and four were treated with botulism antitoxin medication due to concerns that the botulinum toxin could have spread beyond the injection site. Five women were tested for the illness botulism. Their results were negative.The incidents of counterfeit Botox being administered to consumers appear to be connected to products that have been purchased from unlicensed sources and then administered by either unlicensed or licensed providers.The FDA warns health-care professionals that purchasing and administering counterfeit products puts patients’ health at risk and all providers should check products for any signs of counterfeiting before using them.The counterfeit Botox products may be identified by the lot number C3709C3 found on the outer carton and vial, the FDA said.The outer carton also may display the active ingredient as “Botulinum Toxin Type A” instead of “OnabotulinumtoxinA.” Also, the carton and vial may indicate 150-unit doses, which is not a unit made by the companies AbbVie or Allergan, the FDA said, and the outer carton may contain language that is not English.<h2>What questions you should ask</h2>The growing spread of counterfeit Botox has horrified Dr. Lavanya Krishnan, a board-certified dermatologist in San Francisco who founded the practice Arya Derm and has been following the FDA and CDC warnings closely.“I think it’s horrific and honestly really sad to think that someone is going in for what should be a very simple, straightforward aesthetic injection and walking out with symptoms that are classic for botulism,” Krishnan said.In the United States, there are five different types of FDA-approved neurotoxins used for cosmetic purposes, according to the American Board of Cosmetic Surgery: Botox under the company Allergan; Dysport under the company Galderma; Jeuveau under the company Evolus; Daxxify under Revance Therapeutics and Xeomin under Merz Aesthetics. Providers purchase these products directly from the company manufacturers to ensure that they are getting the real FDA-approved product, Krishnan said.“So, the best way to find a licensed provider is to go to the company websites for these products — say you wanted Botox, you would go to the company Allergan’s website, and Allergan actually should have a list of licensed providers who they are selling their product to,” Krishnan said, adding that it also can be helpful for consumers to ask their providers where they are getting their product from.“Counterfeit products are often quoted at much lower prices, and that should be a tip-off to ask more questions about where that product was purchased from, and patients have a right to know,” Krishnan said.“Sometimes when the price is too good to be true, that should be a tip-off,” she said. “Brand name Botox typically costs a certain amount. Prices can vary a little bit from clinic to clinic, based on the practitioner and based on the location of the clinic, but if the price is way cheaper, I think that sometimes that should be a flag.”If a provider is not licensed then the manufacturer won’t sell them their product, said plastic surgeon Dr. Jimmy Sung, medical director of Tribeca Aesthetics in New York City, who has treated patients with adverse reactions from previous cosmetic services.“First of all, if you’re not licensed, you can’t get the drug legitimately. The manufacturer will not sell it to you,” Sung said.Most often, when counterfeit Botox is sold, “the injector knows they’re purchasing something counterfeit,” Sung said. “And the counterfeiter knows that they’re selling to somebody who’s most likely not a board-certified plastic surgeon or a board-certified dermatologist.”<h2>The symptoms to watch for</h2>Botox as a product contains the neurotoxic protein botulinum toxin, which, when used in small doses, can treat various medical or cosmetic concerns, such as severe underarm sweating, chronic migraines, overactive bladder or temporarily smoothing facial wrinkles.“Botox and its peer brands provide a dilute, precise, and consistent amount of botulinum toxin, whereas knock-off unregulated products are not reliably manufactured or subject to the same quality assurance, which can lead to over or underdosing,” said Dr. Michael Cameron, president and founder of Cameron Dermatology and assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Mount Sinai Health System in New York.When in the body at high levels, the toxin botulinum can cause the rare but serious illness botulism, or symptoms similar to those from the illness.“Signs and symptoms of botulism include muscle weakness, vision changes, slurred speech, difficulty moving your eyes. An emergency would be if you start to have difficulty breathing,” Cameron said.“I personally recommend if you’re getting Botox for your wrinkles, you go to a board-certified dermatologist. If you’re getting Botox for your migraines, you go to a neurologist. If you’re getting Botox for your bladder issues, you go to your urologist,” Cameron said. “If you feel like there’s any risk or the pricing doesn’t really make sense, then you could just ask to actually see the vial and inspect the vial of Botox yourself.”Sung said that counterfeit Botox could be made in a cheaper way that makes it more potent, causing serious reactions, or it could be made in a way that makes it more easily spreadable once it’s injected under the skin, raising the risks of it traveling to other parts of the face or body where it was not initially intended for.“The factories that make fake Botox usually don’t have the tightest quality control. They could have a bad batch that’s more potent, that spreads out a little more than the next batch,” Sung said. “It’s no different than getting a bad batch of fentanyl or heroin on the street.”Counterfeit toxins, used for cosmetic purposes, seem to have been circling on the market for some time, Sung said.“I’m actually surprised that it took like, almost 20 years for the FDA to actually issue something. Although I’ve never seen it, I’m aware that this is going on,” he said. “I’m aware because patients tell me.”<h2>How to find the right provider</h2>If a provider is hesitant or deceptive in sharing details about their training, their credentials, or where they purchased product from, that behavior should be a “massive red flag” and patients should not be afraid to ask questions or reconsider whether they are at the right place to receive these types of treatments, Dr. Steven Williams, president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, said in an email Tuesday.“Providers that won’t show you the original bottle or packaging that the Botox came in should be viewed with some suspicion,” Williams said. He added that rules around injecting medications like Botox can vary somewhat from state to state, but in most states, nurses, physician assistants and physicians can inject Botox, but in some places, it is required for nurses to be supervised by physicians when administering the injections.“Patients should be suspicious if they are offered Botox injections in hotel rooms or at home. Generally, the most qualified physician, physician assistant, or nurse will be working at a plastic surgeon or dermatology office,” Williams said. “These providers are not only expert injectors of these types of medications but are well prepared to manage potential complications and advise on the risks and benefits of these treatments.”Other steps that patients can take to find the right provider including checking patient reviews for the provider’s practice and making sure there aren’t any that describe concerning side effects from the Botox, such as slurred speech, difficulty breathing or double vision, Dr. Cynthia Elliott, owner and primary practitioner of Skinspirations in Florida, said in an email Tuesday.“Read the reviews that aren’t 5 stars to see what patients were not happy about and if there are a lot describing bad outcomes that sound legitimate, skip that practice because there are plenty of better ones,” Elliott said.Also, “check the before and after photos used on the provider’s website to confirm that they are their own patients’ photos. There’s often a watermark in the photo so that it can’t be used to show results on another provider’s website. Be wary if they only have before and after photos published by the manufacturer,” she said, adding, “Make an appointment for a consultation with the provider to get a feel for their knowledge before committing to a treatment. Some practices only allow you to meet with what is essentially a salesperson during your consultation, which is a red flag.”",2024-04-16 16:33:00,Counterfeit Botox has been found in several states.

Mira Cheng,"Clyde Davis battled a methamphetamine and heroin addiction for over nine years. He tried various treatment programs, but none worked for him before he reached his insurance maximum and was forced to discharge.“I was trying to die; just putting myself through torture because I didn’t feel like I deserved to live and be happy,” Davis said.Then three years ago, he became one of the first participants in a new contingency management program at the Rimrock Foundation, Montana’s oldest nonprofit addiction treatment center.Contingency management uses positive reinforcement as a behavioral treatment for stimulant addiction. People are rewarded with small-value gift cards or vouchers for submitting urine drug tests negative for stimulants.Decades of research show that it is the most effective treatment for stimulant addiction, but it has not been widely implemented due to policy barriers and stigma.The program changed the game for Davis. He said that the rewards and counseling gave him hope and made him more willing to accept help.“I was able to get myself some clothes, something to eat,” he said. “It really motivated me to want to keep showing up and keep having clean [drug tests].”Davis graduated from the 12-week program successfully and has abstained from drugs ever since. He now works as a rehabilitation technologist at the Rimrock Foundation, alongside the people who he says helped save his life.“I am living a life that I never thought I would ever dream of living. It’s beautiful,” he said.Stimulants are a class of drugs that speed up the body’s systems and can lead to increased alertness, energy and feelings of euphoria. These drugs can be very addicting because they flood the brain with dopamine, hijacking reward pathways, according to a report by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.Prescription stimulants are used to treat ADHD and narcolepsy. Other stimulants, like methamphetamine and cocaine, are considered drugs of abuse, according to the Drug Enforcement Agency. Misuse of these drugs is associated with agitation, hostility, panic, aggression, and suicidal or homicidal tendencies.Illegal stimulants, like methamphetamine and cocaine, are playing an increasingly large role in the national overdose crisis. Experts have called it the “fourth wave” of the opioid epidemic. While the first wave of opioid overdose deaths was driven by prescription opioids, the second wave by heroin, the third wave by synthetic opioids, this “fourth wave” is characterized by extremely potent synthetic opioids like fentanyl and concurrent stimulant use.Data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that overdose deaths in the United States involving cocaine increased by more than 5-fold, and overdose deaths involving methamphetamine increased by more than 14-fold between 2011 and 2021. In 2021, more than 106,000 people died of a drug overdose in the United States – and over half of those deaths involved a stimulant.Michael McDonell, professor of community and behavioral health at the Washington State University Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine, said that the increasing potency of stimulants is one factor contributing to the uptick in stimulant-involved overdose deaths. Another factor is the increasing concurrent use of stimulants and opioids, he said. Some people purposefully mix the two to use the “upper” effect of the stimulant to offset the fatigue caused by opioids, while others inadvertently end up taking stimulants contaminated with opioids.“In many cases the supply is so mixed that people don’t even know what they are using,” McDonell wrote in an email.Given the danger of deadly overdose from this mixed supply, effective treatments for both opioid and stimulant addiction are necessary and urgent, he added.While there are medication-based therapies like methadone and buprenorphine approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for opioid addiction, no such treatments exist for stimulant addiction.“What we’re finding in our program is that a lot of our patients, while they’re finding success in recovery from opioid use disorder, the concurrent stimulant use disorder is causing a lot of problems and really getting in the way of the treatment,” said Katie Chiasson-Downs, lead clinician for addiction services at West Virginia University.<h2>How contingency management works</h2>Contingency management is the most effective behavioral treatment for stimulant addiction, but it remains underutilized, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services.“We’re in the midst of a crisis of fatal overdose in the United States. It’s largely driven by opioids, but it’s also driven by stimulant use disorder,” said Dominick DePhilippis, deputy national mental health director for substance use disorders in the Veterans Health Administration. “There’s a moral imperative to make this very effective treatment available to patients. It can save lives.”Contingency management encourages abstinence using positive reinforcement. The approach has proven highly effective in multiple clinical trials at keeping people addicted to stimulants in treatment and reducing their drug use in both the short-term and the long-term.Program structures vary, but most are 12 weeks long and require participants to submit two urine drug tests over the course of a week – this schedule is based on the two-to-three-day detection window for stimulants, DePhilippis said. When a participant submits a negative urine drug test, they receive a reward in the form of a voucher or gift card ranging in value from $5 to $25. The rewards have restrictions on them so participants cannot purchase firearms, alcohol, other drugs, or anything related to gambling, he added.Often programs will escalate the amount of the reward to encourage consistent behavior, DePhilippis said. For example, the first two negative drug tests will be rewarded with $5, the next two with $6.25 and so on. If participants submit a positive urine drug test after a streak of negative ones, the value of the reward resets back to the starting amount.Consistency is critical to recovery, DePhilippis said. When someone’s brain is chronically exposed to stimulants, their reward centers become dysfunctional to the point where they can no longer derive pleasure from everyday activities such as being with loved ones or eating a good meal. However, research has shown that the brain can heal if it is given time away from the drugs.“Contingency management is like a scaffold we place on the brain to allow the brain to heal so that in the long run, when we withdraw the incentives, the naturally occurring incentives that come from recovery can maintain the behavior,” DePhilippis said.DePhilippis has been running the Veterans Health Administration’s contingency management program for stimulant addiction since 2011 – the largest implementation of the approach to date. He said the program has treated over 6,800 participants and the outcomes are comparable to what is found in research. Of the over 88,000 urine drug tests submitted, more than 92% have tested negative for the target drug, he said.“You can take this treatment from bench to bedside. It translates effectively in a complex healthcare organization,” DePhilippis said.Contingency management has been shown to reduce complications of substance use and promote better health outcomes, including better heart health and a reduction in high-risk sexual behaviors in people who use drugs, according to an HHS report. It is also associated with positive social outcomes, such as improvements in employment and in family and social relationships.<h2>‘I don’t want to feel sick like that anymore’</h2>Matt Cottrell was in his last year of high school in West Virginia when he started abusing prescription opioid pills. Things spiraled from there – for the next 22 years, he struggled with an opioid and methamphetamine addiction.“It’s a bigger struggle than anybody would ever imagine,” he said. “It’s one thing I would never wish on any human being, not even my worst enemy.”Cottrell, who is now 41 years old, entered a comprehensive opioid addiction treatment program at West Virginia University run by Chiasson-Downs in the spring of 2022 that utilized the contingency management approach. He successfully graduated from the program, and this spring marks his second year abstinent from drugs.The contingency management program “makes you feel good, it actually gives you hope,” he said. “It makes you feel like there’s somebody out there wanting to see you succeed instead of fail.”He said that the program gave him a sense of self-efficacy and helped him realize that he could do something good with his life if he tried. He used the rewards he got for negative urine drug tests to buy gas so he could drive to and from the treatment center and to buy snacks at work.Gradually, the naturally occurring rewards of recovery became clear to him and motivated him to stay sober even after the program was over.“It’s a better life being able to go to work and function,” he said. “I don’t want to feel sick like that anymore.”Nowadays, Cottrell spends his time working at a lumber yard and fixing up cars – he’s currently working on restoring a Ford Bronco. He said these activities give him a newfound sense of purpose.<h2>Barriers to implementation</h2>While contingency management was life-changing for both Cottrell and Davis, the treatment is not a perfect solution for everyone struggling with a stimulant addiction, Chiasson-Downs said.“I see it as a tool in the bigger toolbox,” she said. “There’s the therapy component, the peer support component, the contingency management component. We want patients’ recovery to be well-rounded so we as a treatment system need to be well-rounded.”Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, echoed this sentiment and said that combining contingency management with other approaches, such as community reinforcement programs, can improve outcomes in the long run.Contingency management has been criticized for being a short-term solution that does not lead to long-term recovery, Volkow said. While there are studies that show that it is does effectively lower drug use for up to one year, more research is needed to evaluate and improve the long-term efficacy of the approach. She also said that more research is needed to develop medication-assisted therapies for stimulant addiction.As there are currently no medications approved to treat stimulant addiction, contingency management remains the most effect intervention, but it faces some challenges to implementation due to stigma and policy barriers, McDonell said.The approach has received some pushback due to moral concerns about paying people for refraining from harmful, and in some cases, illegal activity, DePhilippis said. Although these criticisms are in good faith, he said, they are misguided.“In contingency management, we are reinforcing a behavior that is in the patient’s best interest,” he said.McDonell said that the stigma tends to fade once people learn more about the approach and witness its benefits.Implementation of contingency management also faces policy and funding challenges, McDonell said. Under current government fraud and abuse laws, a contingency management reward could be considered an illegal “kickback:” an incentive for a user to enter a program that the operator is compensated for on the basis of enrollment. While these laws are important for preventing fraud, they should be revised to exempt contingency management which is an evidence-based health intervention, he added.Another barrier is the $75 annual limit per client that HHS imposes on grant recipients, McDonell said. This limit is well below the scientifically established value of incentives required for effective contingency management (closer to $599 or more over 12 weeks), he said.DePhilippis added that the $75 limit is problematic because it may miscast contingency management as an ineffective treatment, when in fact it is the implementation that is wrong.“It’s like giving an effective medication, but at an ineffective clinical dose,” he said.Dr. Yngvild Olsen, director of the federal Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, said at the 2024 Rx and Illicit Drug Summit that SAMHSA is aware that the grant limit is “subtherapeutic” and the matter of increasing it is “under review.”In the meantime, certain states like California, Washington, Montana and Delaware have gained approval to use federal funds to pay for contingency management as a Medicaid benefit and to evaluate its effectiveness at scale. California launched a state-wide pilot in 2023 that aims to implement the approach at 166 sites across 24 counties.“Contingency management may have its challenges in implementation, but its effectiveness is unquestionable,” DePhilippis said. “The need for it is unquestionable.”",2024-04-16 06:32:00,"Small gift cards can be a key tool to stop stimulant addiction, but stigma stands in the way",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/16/health/addiction-stimulants-treatment-contingency-management/index.html
Jen Christensen,"Zepbound, a popular weight loss drug, also seems to help people with obstructive sleep apnea, drugmaker Eli Lilly said Wednesday.Based on results from trials in people with sleep apnea, the company said it plans to submit the material to the US Food and Drug Administration to potentially expand the use of Zepbound for obstructive sleep apnea.Obstructive sleep apnea is a disorder that causes people to briefly stop breathing while they are sleeping, sometimes several times an hour. This condition can keep a person from feeling fully rested because their brain wakes them up when the body senses that they are no longer breathing. The disorder can also make people much more prone to developing other serious health problems such as coronary heart disease, heart failure and stroke. The World Health Organization estimates about 100 million people have this disorder globally.While people are more at risk for obstructive sleep apnea as they get older, it often develops when people gain weight and have overweight or obesity. Fat deposits around the upper airway will end up obstructing it, which stops their normal breathing. Earlier studies have shown that when people lose weight, it can help improve their sleep apnea.The US Food and Drug Administration approved Zepbound to treat obesity in November. The drug contains the active ingredient tirzepatide, which originally approved in 2022 to treat type 2 diabetes under the name Mounjaro. Some doctors have been prescribing the weekly injection off label to people with obstructive sleep apnea, and Lilly has been testing the drug for obstructive sleep apnea since June 2022.The company released preliminary results of the studies on Wednesday that showed adult patients with obesity and obstructive sleep apnea who were treated with the drug saw an improvement in their sleep apnea when compared with adults who did not receive the drug. The trial enrolled more than 400 people.“We were delighted to see this really large effect that, to my knowledge, is the largest effect ever seen in this disease,” Dr. Daniel Skovronsky, Eli Lilly’s chief scientific officer, told CNN in a telephone interview.One study looked at the effect of the drug on people who were both unwilling or unable to use positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy, a machine that will pump pressurized air into a person’s airway to keep it open and prevent breathing problems while they sleep. People who use the machine must wear a mask or use a nosepiece and some people find it difficult to sleep with the device. The other study looked at a group who used or planned to continue to use the PAP machine.The late-stage trials showed that people had fewer breathing events while they were sleeping when they were on the drug, compared with those that didn’t get the drug. There only seemed to be a slight difference between those who were using PAP therapy.Those who took the drug in this part of the study also lost weight. They saw a more than 18% mean body weight reduction from when they first started the trial. Those who were on a placebo lost 1.3%, the company said.At a year, those with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea who were taking the medication and not using PAP therapy saw a reduction of 27.4 events per hour, compared with a reduction of 4.8 events per hour in the participants who got the placebo.In the second study, researchers found that people who used or planned to use PAP therapy and took the drug saw a slightly larger reduction in the number of events they had while they were sleeping. At 52 weeks, those who took the drug saw an average reduction of 30.4 events per hour compared with an average reduction of six events per hour in people who got a placebo. In the second study, people on the drug saw a weight reduction of 20.1% from their baseline compared with 2.3% among those taking the placebo.The weight loss seen with tirzepatide has typically reduced what’s known as subcutaneous fat, Skovronsky said, or “fat in the soft tissues under the skin, which is what you sort of see in the mirror and what you register on the scale, because that’s where most of the fat deposition is.”But, he said, sleep apnea is caused by “ectopic fat deposition, meaning fat deposited in places where it normally is not” — around the tongue and trachea, for example, “that push the airway closed when you’re sleeping.”A key question the studies sought to answer was whether tirzepatide also reduced those deposits of ectopic fat, he said; other studies have shown it also has an effect on visceral fat that’s found around the organs and is associated with disease.“We didn’t really know how well it would work in this particular type of abnormality, whether it would be really good at clearing the fat around the airway, or maybe that lags behind the subcutaneous fat that we’ve normally focused on,” Skovronsky said.He noted his team sees treating sleep apnea in this way not as “a symptomatic therapy like CPAP, which opens up the airways,” but instead potentially “removing natural causes of sleep apnea in these patients, which is great news.”The results have not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal. Eli Lilly told CNN that it is still evaluating the results and will share details at a meeting of the American Diabetes Association in June.CNN’s Meg Tirrell and Amanda Sealy contributed to this report.",2024-04-17 20:00:00,"Weight loss drug Zepbound may help people with obstructive sleep apnea, drugmaker says",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/17/health/zepbound-sleep-apnea-weight-loss-lilly/index.html
Meg Tirrell,"Kerry Pearl remembers the pharmacist holding up the medicine her 4-year-old son needed to help him breathe.“He was literally holding it, looking at me like: ‘I can’t give you this,’ ” she recalls. “My poor kid is at home not sleeping through the night and waking up coughing, and you’re holding the answer and the insurance company kind of holds the keys here.”It was the asthma drug fluticasone, whose brand name is Flovent. It’s used daily by the youngest children with asthma as a preventive medicine so their airways don’t get so swollen that a trigger — a virus, cold air, pollen — could cause an asthma attack.As a toddler, before Pearl’s son started it, she said he would cough all night and sometimes gasp for breath when he talked. With the medicine, she said, his asthma was finally under control.But the maker of Flovent, British drug giant GSK, removed the branded drug from the US market in January, and its replacement — an authorized generic form identical in all but branding — doesn’t have the same insurance coverage. It costs hundreds of dollars a month without it. The move has left families like Pearl’s scrambling.Asthma drugs can be pricy across the board, so much so that the Senate health committee, led by Sen. Bernie Sanders, opened an investigation into the situation in January.Shortly afterward, three of the biggest makers of asthma inhalers, including GSK, pledged to cap out-of-pocket costs for some US patients at $35.The problem, doctors and parents told CNN, is those pledges don’t apply to daily inhalers used by the youngest kids with asthma.“While the progress that’s been made with the out-of-pocket caps is great, and has left a lot of us in general feeling optimistic, children still can’t get their hands on a preventive asthma inhaler,” said Dr. Robyn Cohen, a pediatric pulmonologist at Boston Medical Center.It’s a situation that has put kids in danger of asthma flare-ups and visits to the ER.<h2>Asthma drugs for the littlest kids</h2>There are three inhalers in this category that the youngest kids with asthma can use, Cohen explained. They’re called metered-dose inhalers, and they’re paired with a device called a spacer — essentially a face mask that connects to the dispenser. That enables the medicine to be given as an aerosol so little kids can just breathe it in.“A child just needs to breathe through the face mask and we know that they’re getting the medication,” Cohen said. Other devices in the category, she explained, “require the patient to initiate a strong deep breath in, and then they have to hold their breath for 10 seconds.”That’s not something toddlers and young children can be taught to do.Since GSK took branded Flovent off the market earlier this year, the three options left have become increasingly expensive and hard to find.The authorized generic version of Flovent, fluticasone, is sold by a different company, Prasco Laboratories. So GSK’s pledge to cap monthly out-of-pocket costs at $35 across all of its asthma and COPD products doesn’t apply to generic fluticasone.But the generic isn’t covered as widely by insurers as branded Flovent was, likely because it doesn’t come with rebates paid by the manufacturer to lower its net cost. Pharmacy benefit managers, which make decisions about how drugs will be covered by insurance, told CNN the authorized generic was more expensive than the branded version.Doctors like Cohen and Christy Sadreameli, a pediatric pulmonologist at Johns Hopkins, saw this coming last year. One solution was to try to switch kids to another option, Asmanex, but that drug has now gone into shortage as a result.“It was much worse than we expected,” Sadreameli told CNN. “I have very few tools for this population.”The third inhaler in this category is called Alvesco, and it also doesn’t have broad insurance coverage, Cohen said — perhaps because it carries a higher list price. Sadreameli cited data showing it costs more than $300 a month before insurance coverage; Asmanex is less than half that.“All of us know of know of a child who has struggled as a result of this,” Cohen said.<h2>Going without needed medication</h2>Julie Leach’s 13-year-old daughter, Abby, has a very rare condition called cerebrocostomandibular syndrome that restricted her lung development, and she was doing well on Flovent until it was discontinued.And the insurance tangles for these medications can lead families through bureaucratic odysseys to get the inhalers their kids need — a process they have to go through every month.Her insurance suggested Abby use a drug called Pulmicort instead of the generic Flovent. Abby’s doctor, Sadreameli, said Abby should stick with the metered dose inhalers that can be used with spacers, since Abby has a tracheostomy tube in her airway. Sadreameli and her team spent time working with Leach’s insurance provider to agree on a solution, and they settled on Alvesco.“Then insurance came back and denied it, and I was like, ‘No, no – you just approved this,’ ” Leach told CNN.It ended up taking a month to work out, while Abby didn’t have any medication. When insurance finally did approve the drug, a patient assistance coupon was applied to it that carried a $65 copay, when Leach’s secondary Medicaid coverage should have come with none.“It took another probably two weeks for me to call around to all these people” to get the coupon removed, Leach said. “Meanwhile, she doesn’t have any inhaler … I’m panicking because she’s never really been without an inhaler ever. So I really didn’t know how her lungs were going to react, not having medicine.”Leach said every month, when she goes to fill the prescription — for just one of more than a dozen medicines Abby needs — she holds her breath.Some insurers do provide coverage options; OptumRx, one of the major PBMs, told CNN it allows children 5 and under to get the authorized generic Flovent without prior authorization review, an extra step required for certain medicines. It said for other patients who need it, “their care provider only needs to indicate that a spacer is required.”CVS Caremark, another large PBM, said patients age 6 and under are able to receive the drug without submitting a formulary exception, and for older patients, “reasonable exceptions will continue to be available based on patient-specific clinical rationale.”Yet it is not always clear which PBM a patient has when a doctor is prescribing a medicine, Sadreameli said, and they frequently encounter hurdles – including having to spend hours on phone calls or filling out paperwork to obtain coverage. And, said Cohen, out-of-pocket costs can still be high even with coverage.Alvesco and Asmanex are made by Covis Pharma and Organon, which are not among the companies that made the $35 pledges on asthma and COPD drugs. Aside from GSK, the other two manufacturers that did are Boehringer Ingelheim and AstraZeneca.Organon told CNN it’s “working tirelessly to increase supply” of Asmanex, and said it already offers a savings coupon for privately insured patients to enable them to pay “as little as $15” for each prescription.Covis and Prasco, the maker of the authorized generic fluticasone, didn’t immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment on whether they planned to implement price caps.For parents like Leach and Pearl, the lack of help for kids is incredibly frustrating.“I don’t know why we’re treating kids as kind of like a lesser population,” Pearl said. “Kids need to breathe just like adults do.”",2024-04-17 16:21:00,"‘Kids need to breathe just like adults do’: $35 price caps don’t apply to asthma meds young children need, doctors say",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/17/health/asthma-inhaler-kids-price-cap/index.html
Brenda Goodman,"The bird flu spreading through cattle in the United States is an “enormous concern” the chief scientist of the World Health Organization said Thursday as he called for more tracking and preparation for the virus.So far, there is no evidence that the highly pathogenic H5N1 flu virus can spread from person to person. This flu strain was first detected in birds in 1996 and has primarily been a threat to farmed and wild fowl, but in the past two years, an increasing number of mammals have tested positive with the virus, indicating that the virus is looking for new hosts and moving closer to people.“The great concern, of course, is that in doing so and infecting ducks and chickens — but now increasingly mammals — that that virus now evolves and develops the ability to infect humans. And then critically, the ability to go from human-to-human transmission,” Dr. Jeremy Farrar, a British medical researcher and chief scientist at WHO since 2023, told reporters on Thursday in Geneva.“We have to watch, more than watch, we have to make sure that if H5N1 did come across to humans with human-to-human transmission that we were in a position to immediately respond with access equitably to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics.”Farrar’s comments came in a response to a question during a news conference about WHO’s new definition for airborne pathogens.Though H5N1 doesn’t spread from person to person, humans can catch it when they’re exposed to infected animals. In the US, one person in Texas has tested positive for H5N1 this year. That person was working with cows when they tested positive, and it is believed they caught it from an infected cow.They are only the second documented case of human H5N1 in the United States. The first was in a poultry worker in Colorado in 2022.Though it doesn’t spread easily to humans, researchers are worried about it because of how deadly these infections can be. Since 2003, 889 human cases and 463 deaths have been reported from 23 countries, giving this virus a case fatality rate of 52%, according to the WHO.“This virus is a really scary virus. It’s something I would hate to see in humans,” Dr. Richard Webby, director of the WHO’s coordinating center for studies on the ecology of influenza and a scientist at St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital, told CNN.Webby, who has been studying H5N1 for 20 years, said even though this virus has never figured out how to efficiently make people sick, “what’s happening now there are lots more small mammals being infected with this virus and we’ve ever seen in the past 20, close to 25 years of monitoring, so that is absolutely concerning,” he said.Webby said H5N1 is more active now than it ever has been, but it still hasn’t developed key mutations that scientists are worried about that could help it infect people.“Because we haven’t seen those changes does suggest to me that this virus has got quite a hurdle to overcome to become a real sort of human pathogen,” Webby said.So far in the United States, the US Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services has reported 29 infected herds in eight states — Texas, New Mexico, Kansas, South Dakota, Idaho, Michigan, Ohio and North Carolina.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that while the current risk to public health from H5N1 is low, it is monitoring the situation carefully. In an update posted to its situation summary on Thursday, the CDC said is studying the virus isolated from the recent human case in the US and found it to be susceptible to antiviral medications.The agency also said it has created a candidate vaccine virus that can be used as a template to make a vaccine if needed.",2024-04-19 09:03:00,WHO chief scientist calls for increased monitoring and preparation for highly pathogenic bird flu,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/19/health/bird-flu-who/index.html
Lisa Respers France,"One thing about Taylor Swift is she will rip her own heart open and spill the blood in the form of her song lyrics.Welcome to “The Tortured Poets Department.” Her latest music continues Swift’s tradition of sharing insight about her feelings and relationships in her songs.The double album seems to spill quite a bit of tea, and the Swifties can’t drink it fast enough.Let’s take a look at a few of the songs and who her diehard-fan base has determined they are about.<h2>“The Tortured Poets Department”</h2>The title track could easily be thought to be about British actor Joe Alwyn, whom Swift quietly dated before splitting after six years in early 2023. That’s because Alwyn and his friends – fellow actors Paul Mescal and Andrew Scott – shared have previously shared their group chat is titled, “Tortured Man Club.”Instead it looks like the song may be about The 1975 band frontman Matty Healy, whom Swift was first linked with in 2014 and then later, briefly, after her split from Alwyn.Clues include the opening in which Swift sings, “You left your typewriter at my apartment.” Healy expressed a fondness for typewriters in a 2019 interview with GQ magazine.Healy was viewed as problematic by some Swifties because of past controversies. “But Daddy I Love Him” on the new album is thought to address that as it takes on the theme of being in a relationship that is met with disapproval by others.<h2>“So Long, London”</h2>It’s a safer bet that this single is about Alwyn, a Brit who had Swift spending a good bit of time across the pond from her native US.The song laments not only the loss of love, but also the loss of the seeming good times they had in the city she came to adore.“Thinking how much sad did you think I had, did you think I had in me?/ Oh, the tragedy,” she sings. ”So long, London/You’ll find someone.”Many see the new song as an extension to her single “London Boy,” featured on her 2019 “Lover” album, also  believed to be about Alwyn.<h2>“The Alchemy”</h2>Swift has moved on to happier times and unlike her mostly private relationship with Alwyn, she’s been loving professional football player Travis Kelce out loud. So it stands to reason that the song with all the sports references is probably about her new star player.“So when I touch down/ Call the amateurs and cut ‘em from the team,” Swift sings. “Ditch the clowns, get the crown/ Baby I’m the one to beat.”Way to score, Tay.<h2>“thanK you aIMee”</h2>Honorable mention also has to go to another celeb who may have broken Swift’s heart in a different way.Given that the capital letters in this tune spell “KIM,” listeners are convinced that this song, which on the surface appears to be about a school bully, is taking a shot at Kim Kardashian.The women famously disputed about Kardashian’s then husband, Kanye West, name-checking Swift in his song, “Famous.”“To all my southside n****s that know me best/I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex/Why? I made that b**** famous,” West raps on the song. Kardashian shared an edited video meant to prove that Swift had heard and approved the lyric in advance, which Swift denied.It all led to a whole “Taylor Swift is a snake” trend on social media, and Swift has talked about how she withdrew into herself during that time.In “thanK you aIMee” Swift sings, “I changed your name and any real defining clues/ And one day, your kid comes home singin’ a song that only us two is gonna know is about you.”Suffice it to say, there might be more than just Swift and the song’s subject in the know.",2024-04-19 13:23:00,"Joe Alwyn, Matty Healy and Travis Kelce appear to be Taylor Swift’s latest inspirations",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/19/entertainment/joe-alwyn-matt-healy-travis-kelce-taylor-swiftt/index.html
Deidre McPhillips,"Last summer was the hottest ever recorded in the United States, and heat-related health emergencies also reached record-high levels in some parts of the country.In the United States, the vast majority of emergency department visits for heat-related emergencies — such as heat stroke, heat cramps and sunburns — happen during the warm season that lasts from May through September, peaking in July and August, according to surveillance data collected by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.During the warm season last year, heat-related illnesses accounted for a 20% larger share of emergency department visits than they did in the five previous seasons. Data from hundreds of emergency departments across the country shows that 180 out of every 100,000 total visits were due to heat-related illness in 2023, compared with 151 out of every 100,000 total visits from 2018 to 2022.The risks of peak heat are also becoming more extreme, with the rate of heat-related emergency department visits surging above peaks from previous years and other parts of the same warm season. In July and August of last year, there were more than 300 heat-related emergencies for every 100,000 total emergency department visits, CDC data shows. That’s nearly 50% higher than the average peak rate from 2018 to 2022, and about three times higher than the rate from other warm-season months in the same year. In previous years, risk during the peak heat season was about twice as high as in other warm months in the same year.The US Department of Health and Human Services considers a day to be an extreme heat day if the temperature rises above 95% of the average historical temperatures in that region. The CDC assessed trends in heat-related emergency department visits against a similar threshold.In 2023, all regions of the US experienced at least one day where the rate of heat-related emergency department visits reached an extreme level, topping 95% of rates from 2018 to 2022. In a particular southern region — encompassing Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas — emergency department visits for heat-related illness reached this extreme level for more than a third of 2023’s warm season, including a period of 16 consecutive days. In four southern regions, comprised of 21 states, 2023 brought more days with extreme rates of emergency department visits for heat-related illness than any other year on record.“Deaths and illnesses associated with heat exposure are a continuing public health concern as climate change results in longer, hotter, and more frequent episodes of extreme heat,” CDC experts wrote in a report that published Thursday. “Near real-time monitoring of weather conditions and adverse health outcomes can guide public health practitioners’ timing of risk communication and implementation of prevention measures associated with extreme heat.”Last August, HHS’ Office of Climate Change and Health Equity in partnership with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched a dashboard that uses data from the National EMS Information System to track the rates of EMS responses to 911 calls for heat-related illness and injury. Data updates weekly with a lag of no more than two weeks, showing where states and counties fall relative to the national average and disparities by age, race, gender and urban-rural area.“Heat is the most lethal of all types of extreme weather and heat exposure is worsening with increasing global warming,” Dr. John Balbus, acting director of the HHS Office of Climate Change and Health Equity, said at the time. “But existing data on heat-related deaths don’t shed light on where people actually fall ill.  This new dashboard makes it possible to see where the needs are greatest, plan for the future, and save lives.”CDC has also used data collected from health departments that participate in the National Syndromic Surveillance Program Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-Based Epidemics (ESSENCE) to monitor heat-related health trends. In June and August, high levels of heat-related emergency department visits prompted the agency to issue public health alerts, according to Thursday’s report.The new CDC analysis may underestimate the prevalence of heat-related illnesses since it doesn’t capture cases among people who sought treatment elsewhere, and the Covid-19 pandemic may have generally affected health care utilization patterns. Broad regional analysis may also obscure more local trends.Understanding regional trends and differences in emergency department visits for heat-related illness can help public health officials better develop and implement intervention strategies, according to the new CDC report.“Effective implementation of heat mitigation strategies is associated with social determinants of health,” the authors wrote, such as access to air conditioning, cooling spaces and reliable power grids.Certain groups are particularly susceptible to the health risks of heat waves, including children and adults with underlying health conditions, pregnant women and outdoor workers. In July, President Joe Biden asked the Department of Labor to issue a “hazard alert” for heat and ramp up enforcement to protect workers from extreme heat.“For years, heat has been the number one cause of weather-related deaths in America. And workers, including farmworkers, farmers, firefighters, and construction workers, are disproportionately impacted by extreme heat,” the administration wrote in a statement﻿ on the “hazard alert” proposal.",2024-04-18 13:01:00,"Heat caused record-high rates of health emergencies in some parts of the US last year, CDC report shows",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/18/health/heat-health-emergencies-record-high/index.html
Jacqueline Howard,"The World Health Organization is opening up the definition of airborne pathogens – such as Covid-19, influenza and measles – to include when respiratory droplets spread through the air and when they land on a person, regardless of the size of the droplet.The new report aims to cut down on the confusion around how to “describe the transmission of pathogens through the air that can potentially cause infection in humans,” according to WHO.The phrase “transmission through the air” can be used to describe when infectious respiratory particles become airborne and spread, and the subcategories of “airborne transmission” and “direct deposition” can both fall under this blanket phrase, according to a WHO technical report published Thursday and developed in consultation with hundreds of scientists under a WHO Technical Consultation Group.“Airborne transmission” refers to when infectious respiratory particles expel into the air, such as from coughing or sneezing, and enter the respiratory tract of another person who inhales them, according to WHO. The subcategory “direct deposition” refers to when infectious respiratory particles expel into the air and directly land on another person’s mouth, nose or eyes, potentially causing infection.Those descriptors can involve particles “on a spectrum of sizes” that may expel over both short and long distances, according to WHO. That means there is no threshold or cut-off of particle size when using the updated terminology.“This report is important because it will enable better, clearer communication with the public about transmission of pathogens and how to reduce the risk of transmission,” Linsey Marr, an aerosol scientist and professor at Virginia Tech, who is a member of the consultation group behind the new report, said in an email Thursday.“Prior to this, a flawed understanding of airborne transmission of infectious diseases caused a lot of miscommunication about how Covid-19 was transmitted and how people could best protect themselves. For example, wiping down groceries was not a good use of our time,” Marr said. “Public health agencies were hesitant to use the word ‘airborne’ because of differences in understanding among experts about what it meant. I hope that this report will allow public health communicators to use the word ‘airborne’ because this word is the simplest and clearest way to explain to the average person how a disease might be transmitted.”The WHO report said that the new terminology for airborne pathogens is consistent with how other diseases may be described, such as  “waterborne” or “bloodborne.”“The descriptors included in this document should be seen as a starting point for further evidence review, urgent and detailed discussions and, multidisciplinary research with associated funding,” according to the report.The terminology in the new report can help scientists from across disciplines find agreement and clarity in describing airborne pathogens, Jeremy Farrar, WHO chief scientist, said in a video statement Thursday.“What this document does is bring the disciplines together and get common agreement. When I say ‘aerosol’, when I say ‘through the air’, it doesn’t matter whether I’m an engineer, a clinician, a nurse, a public health person. We know we mean the same thing,” Farrar said. “This actually covers many, many respiratory infections that go through the air. And that is also, I think, historic.”The need for such consensus was evident at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic.<h2>‘There were many failures’</h2>During the pandemic, various terms were used in different ways to describe how the coronavirus could spread, causing much confusion – terms like airborne, airborne transmission or aerosol transmission.“We could all see that the different disciplines were describing things in different ways. People from all of those scientific expertise were using different languages, and therefore they were in some ways talking past each other rather than working together,” Farrar said.Around that same time, a group of scientists urged WHO to be more forthcoming about the likelihood that people can catch the virus from droplets floating in the air.If the new WHO report had been in place before the Covid-19 pandemic, “public health officials might have described transmission as ‘airborne’ and recommended high-quality masks immediately, emphasized the importance of good ventilation indoors, and reduced the emphasis on distancing and hand-washing,” Marr said.The new report addresses a problem that Dr. Jessica Justman, professor of medicine in epidemiology and infectious disease expert at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, said she puzzled over when Covid-19 first emerged – whether coronavirus aerosols versus droplets were more important in transmission.“Respiratory particles exist in a wide continuum of sizes yet for decades, we used a cut-off of 5-10 microns, below which particles were considered aerosol and above which they were considered droplets,” Justman, who was not involved in the new WHO report, said in an email Thursday. “This use of a cut-off size never seemed logical to me and this report recommends we no longer use a cut-off size and instead suggests we view it as the continuum that it is.”The new report “is an improvement,” as it somewhat clarifies the terminology that was used for many years to describe airborne transmission involving larger and smaller particles, Stephen S. Morse, professor of epidemiology at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, said in an email Thursday.With the Covid-19 virus, “some agencies and scientists erroneously believed the spread was only by droplets, which don’t travel as far as the smaller particles. It took some time to recognize that both can enable transmission. This is probably true of most, probably all, respiratory viruses, although the specifics might vary,” said Morse, who was not involved in the new WHO report.“There were many failures in dealing with the pandemic, it would have been useful to have greater clarity but I don’t think it would have made a great difference overall,” he said. “It would have helped people to better protect themselves, but we didn’t have appropriate personal protective equipment available anyway.”",2024-04-18 17:43:00,WHO clarifies what counts as a pathogen that can spread through the air,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/18/health/who-airborne-pathogen/index.html
Madeline Holcombe,"There are a lot of risks when it comes to adolescents using screens — and a new multinational study shows weight-related bullying may be among them.The more time adolescents spend on screens and social media, the greater the likelihood that they will be bullied about their weight, according to the study.The study, published Wednesday in PLOS One, analyzed data from the 2020 International Food Policy Study Youth Survey and involved more than 12,000 adolescents from ages 10 to 17 in Australia, Canada, Chile, Mexico, the United Kingdom and the United States.“Each additional hour of social media use was equivalent to a 13% increase in prevalence of experiencing weight-related bullying,” said lead study author Dr. Kyle Ganson, assistant professor in the Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work at the University of Toronto.Use of Twitter, now called X, and Twitch were associated with the greatest increase in weight-related bullying, with a 69% and 49% increase, respectively, the study showed.An X spokesperson said the social media platform’s policies had evolved since the data was first collected. “X has made significant changes to all its policies and enforcement protocols to protect minors, despite having less than 1% of U.S. users aged 13-17 and strictly prohibiting children under 13 from having an account,” said Joe Benarroch, head of business operations at X, via email.A spokesperson for Twitch said the platform prioritizes user safety and applies community guidelines to all of its content.“Harassment has no place on Twitch, or anywhere online,” said a Twitch spokesperson Elizabeth Busby via email. “We actively enforce these rules and have developed a number of tools, like AutoMod, which helps prevent harmful messages from appearing in chat conversations.“We’ll continue to seek feedback from our community about their experiences on Twitch, including our Safety Advisory Council, Ambassadors, and Guilds. This feedback is invaluable, as we actively review and update our policies to better address evolving harmful behaviors.”“We also want to underscore that users under the age of 13 are not allowed to use Twitch, and we leverage a range of tools to prevent the creation of these accounts,” Busby added.The results are not surprising, given the well-established relationship between social media use and problems such as disordered eating and poor body image, said Kendrin Sonneville, associate professor of nutritional sciences at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. Sonneville was not involved in the research.“Weight stigma and bias are common on social media,” Ganson said in an email. “These findings highlight that adolescents are encountering bullying specifically related to weight, which may further increase the risk for the development of poor body image, disordered eating, and depression and anxiety.”Sometimes the desire to help your child avoid being bullied can become really unhelpful, said Oona Hanson, a parenting coach based in Los Angeles.“Every fiber of (a parent’s) being wants to prevent their kid from going through that,” Hanson said. “And because of the way our culture works, it seems like, ‘Oh, well, the simple solution is just let’s make the body different so that this child’s body won’t be teased or bullied.’”Sonneville has seen such an approach play out all too often.“Unfortunately, I have seen parents try to support their child through experiences of weight-based bullying by suggesting that they try to ‘eat healthier’ or ‘lose some weight,’” she said in an email. “Young people, no matter what their body size, do not deserve to be ridiculed or mistreated because of their weight.”If your attempts to help send the message that your adolescent should change their body, you may accidentally end up siding with the bully instead of your child, she said.“Because for the child’s experience, now the bully is telling them their body is wrong, and the parent is saying, ‘Yes, let’s fix your body,’” Hanson added.To be on your child’s side, it is important to validate their feelings, remind them that the bullying is the problem — not their body — and listen, she said.“We can talk too much as parents, and we really need to try to listen and let our kids know that their feelings matter and that we want to hear that,” Hanson said.One of the positives that can come out of this latest research is if families use it to understand the digital environment their kids are navigating better and to open up conversations around it, Ganson said.“Social media use is ubiquitous among adolescents,” he added. “It’s important for adults in their lives to be aware of their use, the content they are engaging with, and supporting media literacy to ensure they use social media appropriately and are protected from potential harms.”Ganson recommends having conversations with your kids about bullying, particularly related to weight, and how they can think about the comments they may see online.Then, you can come up with solutions together on how to handle social media moving forward, Hanson said.Your children’s school may have support resources, your kids may decide to make their accounts private, or your family might put limitations on screen time, Hanson said.“Weight-based bullying can have a significant impact on the health of young people and should be taken seriously,” Sonneville said.",2024-04-17 15:37:00,"What to do if your kid is bullied about their weight online, according to experts",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/17/health/weight-bullying-social-media-wellness/index.html
"Ted  Barrett,Clare Foran","The Senate voted late Friday to reauthorize a key surveillance authority, avoiding a lapse in the controversial program.Lawmakers voted 60-34 to reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, after the House passed the measure late last week.The House passed the bill after a new version was put forward for a two-year reauthorization instead of five years, a change that helped appease conservatives who had initially revolted against the legislation. A two-year reauthorization would give former President Donald Trump a chance to overhaul the law if he wins the upcoming presidential election.Congress had been up against a Friday deadline after authority for Section 702 was extended through that date as part of the National Defense Authorization Act.Whether Congress would avert the lapse remained in question earlier in the day as senators struggled to reach a deal to renew the key intelligence community surveillance tool.Majority Leader Chuck Schumer had told lawmakers to be prepared to work over the weekend, but by Friday evening, locked in a negotiated agreement to vote. “All day long we persisted and persisted and persisted in hopes of reaching a breakthrough, and I’m glad we got it done,” the New York Democrat said, referencing the stalled negotiations that threatened the program.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell also pressed for passage of the FISA bill, which he said had a number of changes in it to address past “abuses” by the FBI. The Kentucky Republican also warned that some critics of the bill were “fear mongering” that the legislation would allow spying on Americans in coffees shops and other places and should be ignored.Supporters argue Section 702 is a critical tool for safeguarding national security, but it has come under scrutiny from some lawmakers over alleged misuse.Under FISA’s Section 702, the government hoovers up massive amounts of internet and cell phone data on foreign targets. Hundreds of thousands of Americans’ information is incidentally collected during that process and then accessed each year without a warrant — down from millions of such queries the US government ran in past years. Critics refer to these queries as “backdoor” searches.The trove of data, including a large portion of US internet traffic, is meant to provide US intelligence agencies with quick access to data regarding foreigners in other countries.According to one assessment, it forms the basis of most of the intelligence the president views each morning and it has helped the US keep tabs on Russia’s intentions in Ukraine, identify foreign efforts to access US infrastructure, uncover foreign terror networks and thwart terror attacks in the US.The complicated politics surrounding the law have long united strange bedfellows: Some conservative Republicans have joined forces with progressive Democrats to push for reforms to the authority, while security-focused Democrats and Republicans have opposed major new restrictions.On Friday, senators argued over an amendment that would require the intelligence community to get court warrants for spying. The program is currently warrantless, in large part because it is aimed at foreigners not Americans, but US citizens do get swept up in the surveillance when they are interacting with targets abroad. A similar amendment failed in the House, but on a tied vote.Another amendment at issue was from Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, a member of the Intelligence Committee. His amendment, which was co-sponsored by several of the most liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans in the chamber, would strike a new part of the program that he argued would lead every day Americans into helping the government spy if they have “access to equipment that is being or may be used to transmit or store wire or electronic communications.”Last week, in a setback for House GOP leadership, a group of conservatives initially revolted against the bill and brought down a key procedural vote after Trump called on Republicans to “KILL FISA” in a post on Truth Social.That move threw the fate of the measure into question, but leadership ultimately steered a modified version of the surveillance bill to final passage.This headline and story have been updated with additional developments.CNN’s Katie Bo Lillis contributed to this report.",2024-04-20 00:52:00,Senate passes surveillance bill despite contentious debate over privacy concerns,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/19/politics/fisa-senate-negotiations/index.html
"Jeremy Herb,Lauren del Valle","The historic first criminal trial of a former US president begins with opening statements on Monday.Judge Juan Merchan swiftly moved through consideration of roughly 200 potential jurors to find a jury pool of 18 by midday Friday, swearing in 12 jurors and six alternates who will decide Donald Trump’s fate in the New York hush money case.There had been estimates at the start of the week that jury selection could spill into a second week, and it appeared likely after Merchan lost two empaneled jurors on Thursday. But the judge found enough prospective jurors who were willing to serve and said they could be impartial that he didn’t have to turn to a third panel of around 100 jurors in reserve Friday.Trump – whose lawyers on Friday continued to try to delay the trial – complained about Merchan’s pace as he left the courtroom for the day.“The trial starts on Monday, which is long before a lot of people thought. The judge wants this to go as fast as possible. That’s for his reasons, not for my reasons,” Trump said in the hallway of the 15th floor courtroom.Here are takeaways from the final day of jury selection in Trump’s hush money trial:<h2>The jury is set</h2>Four women and one man were added to the jury on Friday as five of the six alternates for the case. They will sit in the jury box and will hear the duration of the trial, but they will only be put on the jury should one or more of the 12 jurors be excused from the case.The final additions to the jury included a woman from Spain, a native New Yorker who is a fan of martial arts, a contract specialist, a woman who works for a clothing company, and a project manager for a construction company.All 18 of the jurors will meet as a group for the first time on Monday morning when the trial is set to begin. Five of the jurors came from an initial panel of 96 that was sworn in Monday, while the rest came from a second panel that did not begin answering questions until Thursday morning.The fourth day of jury selection played out similarly to the first three. Prosecutors focused their questions in the case on preparing the jurors to accept testimony from less-than-favorable witnesses, like Michael Cohen. Trump’s attorneys, meanwhile, were almost singularly focused on a single question: What did jurors think about Donald Trump?The former president appeared less interested in the proceedings during much of the questioning by the district attorney’s office, sitting back in his chair and fiddling with papers. But when his lawyers began asking jurors what they thought of him, the former president was turned toward the jury box, paying full attention.<h2>Final round of juror questions highlights emotional decision for potential jurors</h2>There were several emotional moments during Friday morning’s questioning of potential jurors, with two jurors telling the judge in the middle of voir dire they no longer felt they could serve.One female prospective juror who works in sales for a trading company began crying when she was handed the microphone during the voir dire process.“I’m sorry. I thought I could do this. I wouldn’t want someone who feels this way to judge my case either,” she said, adding: “This is so much more stressful than I thought.”Merchan invited her to come up to the bench to talk privately. He then excused her.At one point after that jury had left, another juror raised her hand and told the court she started feeling “high anxiety” as she sat and listened to a line of questioning about the credibility of witnesses.The woman said she was feeling “anxiety and self-doubt” as she asked to approach the bench. She too was excused.Everyone in the jury pool had the chance to be excused at the outset if they felt they could not be fair and impartial in this case, without further questioning by the judge.The jurors who took part in voir dire on Friday had known that Trump was the defendant in the case since Tuesday, giving them several days to weigh what it would be like to be on the historic panel before having to step into the jury box.But the excused jurors – along with an empaneled juror who was excused earlier in the week after she expressed concerns that part of her identity was made public – underscored how heavily trying a former president weighs on the justice system.<h2>Trump is still trying to stop his trial</h2>Despite seating a jury, Trump’s legal team again tried to stop the trial in its tracks with another strategic appeal.The move shows how Trump lawyers are likely to continue to try to throw up procedural roadblocks in the criminal trial, even as it’s already gotten underway.In a new motion filed Friday morning, Trump’s lawyers once again asked an appeals court to temporarily halt the trial until it ruled on Trump’s appeal to move the venue of the hush money trial out of Manhattan.Attorney Cliff Robert argued on Trump’s behalf at a hastily scheduled hearing Friday afternoon.Robert, speaking in a different courtroom from where the trial was ongoing, told the judge that seating a jury in three days with so many potential jurors being dismissed for cause over bias is “untenable.”Trump unsuccessfully appealed with the same request for a stay over the change of venue motion last week.The DA’s team argued at that point that the motion was premature because jury selection hadn’t happened yet. Robert said Friday that he had rightfully returned to renew Trump’s request since a jury had been empaneled.Robert also pointed to the woman who asked to be dismissed on Thursday following media attention.Trump’s lawyer argued that the juror’s fears proved it’s unfair for Trump to be tried in the city due to the publicity surrounding the former president.The Manhattan District Attorney’s Office Chief of Appeals Steven Wu argued the record actually showed that “jury selection has worked.”There’s been a “robust process,” he said, to ensure jurors can be fair and root out potentially biased jurors.<h2>A hearing on Trump’s gag order violations set for Tuesday</h2>Despite Trump’s attempts to delay, opening statements in his criminal trial will begin Monday morning.Then the trial will fully shift into details about Trump’s alleged affair with an adult film star (which he denies) and the hush-money payment made to her in the run-up to the 2016 election. Prosecutors will lay out the theory of their case, followed by Trump’s attorneys summarizing their arguments against the charges.After that, the first witness will be called. Prosecutors haven’t said who it will be – saying they don’t want to see Trump posting about any witnesses ahead of time.On Tuesday, the morning will shift to Trump’s discussion of witnesses in the case, as Merchan plans to hold a hearing on social media posts by the former president that prosecutors say violated his gag order.They’re asking the judge to fine Trump $1,000 per post and remind him that violations of the gag order could result in imprisonment.",2024-04-20 07:03:00,Takeaways from the final day of jury selection in Trump’s historic hush money trial,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/19/politics/takeaways-final-day-jury-selection-trump-hush-money-trial/index.html
Sandee LaMotte,"It’s 420 or “weed day,” and people around the world will be paying homage to their favorite guilty pleasure: marijuana.Currently, 24 states, two territories and the District of Columbia in the United States have legalized marijuana for recreational use, making it that much easier for people to take a toke or pop an edible at 4:20 p.m. on April 20 (if not all day).But not everyone joins in on the 420 festivities. Some scientists who study weed have become increasingly concerned about the potential harm cannabis can do to the body, especially when smoked or vaped.“When you burn something, whether it is tobacco or cannabis, it creates toxic compounds, carcinogens, and particulate matter that are harmful to health,” Dr. Beth Cohen, professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, told CNN previously via email.Marijuana smoke may even be more harmful than tobacco because users hold the hot smoke in their lungs longer to maximize their high, Cohen said. A March 2021 study found teens were twice as likely to report “wheezing or whistling” in the chest after vaping marijuana than after smoking cigarettes or using e-cigarettes.“I’m in Colorado, and on 420 the smoke billows out of places where people gather to celebrate — it’s like a factory smokestack,” said Robert Page II, a professor of clinical pharmacy and physical medicine at the University of Colorado Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences in Aurora.“I worry when people are in an enclosed space because new data is beginning to show that secondhand marijuana smoke may be just as dangerous as the primary smoke,” Page said. “Like tobacco, cannabis affects the central nervous system, and there are side effects which tend to primarily be cardiovascular in nature.”Any level of marijuana use raises the risk of stroke by 42% and heart attack by 25%, even if there is no prior history of heart disease and the person has never smoked or vaped tobacco, a recent study found. Weed has also been linked to cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation; myocarditis, which is an inflammation of the heart muscle; spasms of the heart’s arteries and a higher risk of heart failure.Despite these health concerns, the majority of American adults still believe smoking or vaping marijuana smoke or breathing secondhand smoke from a joint is safer than tobacco smoke, even if children are present, according to an August 2023 study.It’s not.“If a person is in a closed space with marijuana smokers, they can test positive for cannabis in their urine. They can also get some of the other physical effects of marijuana, including an increased heart rate and feeling ‘high,’ ” Carol Boyd, founding director of the Center for the Study of Drugs, Alcohol, Smoking and Health at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, told CNN in an earlier interview.It’s not just your lungs that may be at risk. A January 2021 study found people who only smoked marijuana had higher blood and urine levels of several smoke-related toxins than nonsmokers. Those toxins are linked to anemia, liver and neurological damage, cancer and other health issues.There’s more: Weed users are nearly 25% more likely to need emergency care and hospitalization, according to a 2022 study, and overuse of marijuana can lead to complications when in surgery. Weed users have more heavy metal in their bodies. Serious traffic accidents are on the rise in areas where weed is legal, a 2023 study found.Potency of weed has skyrocketed, which can heighten health risks and is leading to a global rise in marijuana addiction as well as marijuana use disorder.“Approximately 3 in 10 people who use marijuana have marijuana use disorder,” according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Experts say this condition comes with a higher risk of mental disorders, cognitive deficits, use of psychiatric services and violent behavior.Using marijuana during pregnancy has been linked to low birth weight, one of the strongest predictors of a child’s long-term health.Babies born to mothers who smoke pot or eat edibles to control nausea, for example, were twice as likely to be premature and 2.5 times as likely to be admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit, according to a 2023 study. Just as alarming: A 2020 study found children born to marijuana users had more psychotic-like behaviors and more attention, social and sleep problems as well as weaker cognitive abilities.It’s not good for older children, either. The growing use of weed by adolescents is extremely alarming, experts say, because marijuana is known to damage the developing brain.“The teen brain is actively developing and continues to develop until around age 25,” the CDC states on its website. Use during that time can have permanent effects such as damage to learning, memory, problem-solving skills and the ability to pay attention, the CDC said.“It’s disruptive to the teenage brain, so it needs to be used with extreme caution or not at all,” said Dr. Peter Grinspoon, a primary care physician and cannabis specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who authored “Through the Smoke: A Cannabis Specialist Untangles the Truth About Marijuana.”Young people who use marijuana are more likely to develop long-lasting mental disorders, including depression, social anxiety and schizophrenia, and drop out of school, the CDC said. Studies show overuse of marijuana by youth with mood disorders leads to a rise in self-harm, suicide attempts and death.Daily use by adolescents and adults can result in another unpleasant side effect: uncontrollable vomiting, according to a 2021 study.“They vomit and then just continue to vomit whatever they have in their stomach, which can go on for hours,” study author Dr. Sam Wang, a pediatric emergency medicine specialist and toxicologist at Children’s Hospital Colorado, told CNN previously.Despite these concerns, school-age kids were vaping twice as much weed in 2020 as they did in 2013. In fact, some parents told doctors they believed vaping marijuana was safer than tobacco, Boyd told CNN earlier via email.“You seem to believe that heating chemicals (including carcinogens) into a vapor and inhaling them is healthy? My answer is, ‘No, it is not a healthy behavior.’”In addition to harming the lung, vaping weed is associated with a dangerous, recently identified lung disease called EVALI, short for e-cigarette, or vaping product use-associated lung injury. By early 2020, the CDC had recorded over 2,800 hospitalizations and 68 deaths due to this condition, according to Yale Medicine.Studies do show there are some medicinal benefits from weed. An August 2023 review of literature found cannabidiol, or CBD, reduced seizures in epilepsy. In addition, some cannabinoid mixtures may benefit multiple sclerosis, nausea from chemotherapy, chronic pain and inflammatory bowel disease, “but not without adverse events,” according to the study.Those “adverse” effects may actually be less than the impact of traditional medications, said Grinspoon, who is on the board of the advocacy group Doctors for Drug Policy Reform, which addresses cannabis, psychedelic and drug regulation in general.“People are eating cannabis instead of more dangerous medications like opioids and benzodiazepines (medicines used for anxiety and seizures), which are either addictive or have terrible side effects,” he said. “People are also able to cut down on their nonsteroidals, which are not without harm.”However, there’s a note of caution in that upbeat take. Studies may use purified synthetic cannabis that is not at all like weed purchased off the street, said the University of Colorado’s Page.“Even what is bought in stores may not be what it appears,” Page said. “While the regulatory agencies do look for things like adulteration, for the most part it’s not really regulated in terms of knowing what the exact amount of CBD or THC is in an over-the-counter product.”There’s another point: Many people use medicinal edibles when they want pain relief that lasts over time and may turn to a puff when in need a quick hit of relief, Grinspoon said. Eating marijuana or using a tincture bypasses the harms to the lungs; unfortunately, there has been little research on the benefits or harms of using edibles or other options.There’s a reason for the lack of research. Studies since the 1950s have typically been green-lit for funding only if they were exploring the negative side of marijuana use, experts told CNN.On a federal level, cannabis is still classified as a schedule I substance, the highest level of drug restriction. Researchers must still navigate yards of red tape to get approval from a variety of federal, state and local agencies before a study can start.“Particularly during and after the Nixon administration, researchers could only get money if they focused on the negative consequences,” Boyd said. “Each new generation of researcher followed in their mentor’s footsteps and focused on the negative health consequences.”Another hurdle was getting legal access to marijuana to study it. For more than 50 years, the federal government only permitted the University of Mississippi to grow cannabis for research. Supply couldn’t keep up with demand. It took the US Drug Enforcement Administration until 2021 to begin the search for additional facilities to grow the plant for scientific use.Statewide legalization of recreational marijuana in the last decade has opened a new avenue of scientific inquiry — observational studies in which researchers can ask people about their marijuana use and expect a mostly truthful response. Scientists can now cross-reference insurance, medical and safety data with reported marijuana use to see how it affects the body over time.“There were 4,000 studies about cannabis done over the last two years; that’s a ton of research,” Grinspoon said.  “I think it’s more neutral, and it’s coming from independent think tanks and academia and not just from the cannabis industry.“I think it’s much better now that it’s out of the shadows, and people can be honest when they go to the doctor when they need help,” he added. “In the past, if you’re in the ER and vomiting, you couldn’t say, ‘I was using marijuana.’”Still, at this point, Page said, the data is what it is.“There’s no data to support any benefits of recreational use of marijuana, while there is data to support the use of cannabis for some medicinal purposes.”",2024-04-20 05:30:00,Here’s what marijuana researchers have to say about 420 or ‘weed day’,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/20/health/420-weed-day-expert-caution-wellness/index.html
