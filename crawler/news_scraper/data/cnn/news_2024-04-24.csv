Chris Isidore,"General Motors made more money than expected so far this year, even as union contracts reached last year increased labor costs, its customers faced higher interest rates to buy cars and its electric vehicles still aren’t turning a profit — yet.But GM said it expects its North American EV business to turn a profit in the second half of the year. That and strong demand for traditional gasoline-powered vehicles allowed it to raise its earnings forecast for the year.Reaching a profit on its EV business would be a major milestone, which have yet to make the kind of cash that hybrids and gasoline-powered cars make for traditional automakers, who are planning a shift to EVs in the years ahead. GM officials said Tuesday it believes its EV offerings will be even more profitable moving into 2025, despite the slowdown in growth of demand for EVs in its home market.The company said that it had adjusted net income of $3.0 billion, down 2% from the $3.1 billion it reported on that basis a year earlier. But the company announced a $10 billion share repurchase last fall following its labor deal with the United Auto Workers union. The fewer number of shares outstanding allowed it to report improved earnings per share, which is closely watched by investors. That resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $2.62, up 18.6%, easily topping forecasts that EPS would slip to $2.13.Revenue rose 7.6% to $43 billion, which also topped forecasts by $2 billion, despite a 3% slip in the number of vehicles sold to 1.3 million cars and trucks. But that drop in total vehicle sales came from the company pulling back on lower-priced sales to fleet customers, such as rental car companies, and concentrating more on retail sales to consumers. Fleet sales fell to nearly 16% of its overall sales, down from 19 % of year-ago sales.But more significantly it raised its full-year earnings forecast to between $10.1 billion - $11.5 billion, which is up $300 million from its earlier guidance. And it raised its adjusted earnings before interest and taxes guidance for the year by $500 million.The EPS and revenue beats and the stronger guidance helped lift shares of GM by 4% in premarket trading.Still, there have been rising concerns about the demand for electric vehicles weakening. Tesla, the world’s largest producer of EVs, just reported its first year-over-year drop in global sales since the pandemic and announced it is cutting 10% of its staff. And some established automakers, including GM, have pulled back slightly on its EV production plans.But GM said it is seeing strong retail demand for EVs. CFO Paul Jacobson told reporters on a conference call that much of the pullback on GM’s EV plans are a result of it being “more deliberate.”He said that much of the overall slowing in EV demand is due to Hertz announcing it would stop buying EVs in the near term and sell off 20,000 of the electric vehicles already in its fleet.“When you start to break down some detailed registration info, retail EVs [sales] are not down as much as a lot of folks think,” he noted. “The retail customer is actually holding up pretty strong. We feel good where we’re going with the 200,000 to 300,000 units of [EV] production this year.”Profits across the auto industry have been helped by limited supplies of some raw materials, which cut production of traditional gasoline powered cars and trucks despite strong consumer demand resulting in record new car prices.Those production constraints are largely a thing of the past, and increased production should help to push down pricing. Jacobson told reporters that the company is still looking at between a 2% to 2.5% decline in average pricing over the course of the year although he added that with continued strong consumer demand, “We haven’t seen it yet.”“Our consumer has been remarkably resilient in this period of higher interest rates,” he said. “We think in this environment we can continue to perform.”This is a developing story. It will be updated.",2024-04-23 15:26:00 PM EEST,CNN,GM earnings top forecasts despite headwinds,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/23/business/gm-earnings/index.html
Oliver Darcy,"Editor’s Note: A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.David Pecker is breaking his silence.The former National Enquirer boss on Monday became the first witness called to testify in Donald Trump’s historic hush-money trial. Sitting in the Manhattan courtroom, Pecker offered illuminating details into how the infamous tabloid operated and conducted so-called “catch and kill” operations.“We used checkbook journalism,” Pecker candidly confessed, “and we paid for stories.”It was the first time that Pecker has spoken publicly about the secret practice — buying exclusive rights to a story for the express purpose of never publishing the information — since the tactic gained widespread notoriety during the 2016 presidential election. The Wall Street Journal, which led the way reporting on the story, first broke news in November 2016 — just days before the election — that Enquirer-parent American Media Inc. had paid former Playboy model Karen McDougal $150,000 for the rights to a story about an affair she alleged with Trump.Pecker also allegedly alerted the Trump camp to adult film star Stormy Daniels’ decision to go public with her alleged affair with Trump, which was then captured in a $130,000 hush payment.But while The Journal and other news outlets reported heavily on how Pecker shielded Trump from the embarrassing affair allegations by purchasing the rights to damaging stories and then never letting them see the light of day, Pecker has never spoken a word about it — until now.The one-time Trump ally, who was granted immunity by prosecutors to testify in the case, only took the stand for a short period Monday, as court wrapped in the early afternoon. But during his brief time on the witness stand, Pecker confirmed a number of details that news organizations had previously reported about his operation.Pecker said editors could spend upwards of $10,000 on a story, but that anything more required his explicit approval. And he said that stories of significance had to be approved by him. In other words, as then-chairman of AMI, he was read in on the stories that would have touched Trump. Given their nature, they would have certainly arrived on his desk.As Pecker testified, Trump sat emotionless as he looked at his one-time ally divulge details about the scheme that has put him in serious legal jeopardy, the CNN team at the courthouse reported. Pecker smiled and said “hi” to Trump’s table after stepping down from the witness stand. But the former president, who finds himself forced to sit in a New York court, instead of campaigning across the country, cannot be happy with how this has all played out.And the trial is only getting underway.Pecker will be back on the witness stand Tuesday, when court resumes. And over the course of his testimony, he is expected to offer far more information about how the Enquirer, which boosted Trump’s candidacy in the 2016 election, protected the Republican frontrunner from the damaging stories.While the tawdry details of tabloid journalism are sure to be put on full display, by selecting Pecker as the first witness in the case, prosecutors are clearly banking on his testimony to lay bare the conspiracy to influence the election. On the stand Monday, Pecker said he maintained two email addresses, one for general work and another private one for emails that “I didn’t want my assistant to see.”Given his close friendship with Trump, Pecker’s private inbox of salacious tabloid secrets could hold the key to Trump’s legal fate.",2024-04-23 17:15:00 PM EEST,CNN,Former National Enquirer boss breaks his silence on ‘catch and kill’ as lead witness in Trump trial,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/23/media/national-enquirer-catch-and-kill-trump-trial/index.html
Nathaniel Meyersohn,"For five decades, the southern United States has been an attractive location for foreign automakers to open plants thanks to generous tax breaks and cheaper, non-union labor.Now, the United Auto Workers has dealt a serious blow to that model: winning a landslide union victory after decades of failing to unionize automakers in the South.The UAW easily won a historic victory Friday at Volkswagen’s plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, with 73% of workers voting in favor of the union. It’s the UAW’s first win in trying to represent workers at a foreign car manufacturing plant in the South.While a single win won’t alter the union landscape in the South overnight, labor experts say the Tennessee victory may be a turning point in the least unionized part of the United States. (South Carolina and North Carolina have the lowest union rates in the US; Louisiana is the sixth-lowest.)For one, it may provide momentum for current union drives at foreign auto plants in the South and spill over into organizing efforts in other industries, said Stephen Silvia, a professor at American University and author of “The UAW’s Southern Gamble: Organizing Workers at Foreign-Owned Vehicle Plants.”The UAW’s win at Volkswagen “itself will not realign the South. But it’s an important building block for southern realignment,” Silvia said, adding that the win “challenges the southern growth model.”The UAW has announced an effort to organize workers at 13 carmakers, including foreign automakers such as Volkswagen, Mercedes, BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Mazda, Nissan, Subaru, Toyota and Volvo. The union is also aiming to organize three American EV makers – Tesla, Rivian and Lucid. Of those three, however, only Tesla has a plant in the South, in Texas.The first test of the UAW’s momentum comes next month, when a union vote at a Mercedes plant in Vance, Alabama, is set to be completed. The plant has about 6,000 hourly workers.But the South’s history of difficult structural dynamics for unions is entrenched. And union wins in the auto industry are likely to generate significant political backlash.South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said earlier this year he would “fight” unions “to the gates of hell,” and Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said “the Alabama model for economic success is under attack” by unions.“Unions are an existential threat to the political economy of the South,” said Erica Smiley, the executive director of progressive advocacy group Jobs with Justice. Union members are more active politically, studies show, and likelier to push for pro-worker policies. This poses a challenge to the anti-union political and business consensus of the region.<h2>Auto industry moves to the non-union South</h2>Detroit and other industrial cities in the North dominated the auto industry for much of the 20th century, but the US auto industry has increasingly shifted to the South in recent decades.Nissan opened a plant in Smyrna, Tennessee, in 1983, followed by BMW opening in Spartanburg, South Carolina, in 1994. Mercedes-Benz came to Vance, Alabama, in 1997. Honda moved to Lincoln, Alabama, in 2001. And Volkswagen, Toyota, Hyundai and Kia built factories the South in the 2000s.Since 1990, the South’s share of auto jobs has doubled from around 15% to 30% today, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Meanwhile, the Midwest’s share has declined from 60% to 45%.The transition to electric vehicles is poised to speed up this trend. Mostly nonunion EV jobs and manufacturing investments are surging in Southern states led by Republicans. The region has picked up 66% of planned EV jobs, according to a report by the Environmental Defense Fund.Part of the reason foreign automakers have moved to the South is to escape unions. Before Friday’s win, the highest profile union election held in the South in recent years was the attempt to organize Amazon warehouse workers in Alabama in 2022. The union lost two separate votes there, although there is a hearing set for later this week about objections to that election that could order a third vote or certify the union’s loss.Every state in the South has a “right to work” law, which allows workers to opt out of paying fees to a union at their workplace, even if they benefit from union bargaining agreements, undercutting a union’s financial resources to strategize and collectively bargain.Southern political leaders have also used tax breaks and other subsidies to draw auto investments to states. These incentives have been predicated on companies keeping out unions.“In the South, you’ve had the political and economic establishment that have built an economic model based on low wages and little worker voice,” Silvia said.“When UAW has tried to organize, they’ve tried to fight against it.”GOP leaders have stepped in to block unions and preserve this model.Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee in 2019 visited Volkswagen’s plant in Chattanooga to encourage workers to reject the union, and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said in 2015 she was a “union buster” when recruiting automakers to the state.Southern states such as Georgia have passed laws threatening to cut off subsidies to companies that voluntarily recognize unions.<h2>Overcoming union opposition</h2>A major deterrent to unionizing efforts in the South is the ties between unions and the Democratic party.Rank-and-file workers who supported the UAW effort at the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga told CNN that one problem they faced when trying to drum up union votes was their co-workers’ dislike of Biden — who supported the union in its auto strike last year and whom the union has endorsed.But the Volkswagen win, said UAW President Shawn Fain to CNN, shows that politics are not an insurmountable obstacle when it comes to organizing in the South.“Trump will win Tennessee by a pretty big margin, I would guess. You know what, we just won by 73% in Tennessee,” Fain said. “I’m not worried about the political aspect of this, because our campaign is about bringing justice to workers.”In the wake of the UAW’s victory at Volkswagen, labor advocates expect to see other states pass measures to deter union efforts — but workers may be energized.“I think we’re going to see a lot of efforts to revitalize labor in the South. The gains in Chattanooga won’t stay in Chattanooga,” said Harley Shaiken, a labor historian at the University of California, Berkeley.Erica Smiley from Jobs with Justice said “unions must stop seeing the South as no man’s land” where they can’t win and invest in efforts to organize southern industries.CNN’s Chris Isidore contributed to this article.",2024-04-23 17:28:00 PM EEST,CNN,The anti-union South is starting to crack,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/23/business/uaw-south-jobs/index.html
Jeanne Sahadi,"The Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday voted to ban for-profit US employers from making employees sign agreements with noncompete clauses. Such a ban could affect tens of millions of workers.President Joe Biden soon after the announcement said, “The FTC is cracking down on ‘non-compete agreements,’ contracts that employers use to prevent their workers from changing jobs even if that job will pay a few dollars more, or provide better working conditions. Workers ought to have the right to choose who they want to work for.”The FTC’s decision was the result of a 3-to-2 vote among its five commissioners Tuesday afternoon. The two commissioners who dissented from the majority said they believed the rule to be “unlawful” and “won’t survive legal challenge.” The US Chamber of Commerce has already said it will sue the FTC as early as this week for what it views as the agency exceeding its administrative authority.<h2>What the final rule will do</h2>The FTC estimates that 30 million people – one in five US workers – are bound by a noncompete clause in their current jobs. And for most of them, the agency asserts, such a clause restricts them from freely switching jobs, lowers wages, stifles innovation, blocks entrepreneurs from starting new businesses and undermines fair competition.The final rule is a somewhat narrower version of the proposed rule that the agency put out for public comment in January of 2023.It will ban for-profit employers from issuing new noncompetes to anyone.And – with one exception – it makes currently existing noncompete agreements unenforceable after the rule’s effective date, which is set at 120 days from the rule’s publication in the Federal Register.The rule, however, does allow currently existing noncompete agreements for senior executives to remain in force. Senior executives are defined as workers earning more than $151,164 annually who also are in a “policy-making position.”An FTC staff member presenting the final rule to the commissioners during Tuesday’s meeting characterized noncompete agreements as “exploitative and coercive” for employees other than senior executives. Typically, senior executives are more likely to have a lawyer represent them in contract negotiations and secure compensation in exchange for signing a noncompete agreement. Whereas rank-and-file employees normally don’t negotiate such agreements, which may be presented to them along with other paperwork on their first day on the job.The FTC contends that businesses seeking to protect their trade secrets and other confidential information can do so through the use of confidentiality clauses.The ban would apply nationwide, overriding state laws regarding noncompete agreements. Currently three states (California, North Dakota and Oklahoma) plus Washington, D.C., already have near-complete bans on the books, while some other states – such as Colorado, Maryland, Oregon and Rhode Island – allow them but only within certain parameters, such as limiting them to high-wage earners, said Stefanie Camfield, assistant general counsel at Engage PEO, a human resources services firm.The FTC estimates that its ban would boost wages and benefits by up to $488 billion over a decade.<h2>Legal challenges may delay implementation</h2>Employment lawyers expect there to be legal pushback from employers and business groups that may delay enforcement of the rule while it is challenged in court, and possibly prevent it from ever going into effect if those suing the FTC prevail.Daryl Joseffer, chief counsel of the U.S. Chamber’s Litigation Center, characterized the FTC rule banning noncompetes as an “administrative power grab.” “They’re trying to regulate a century-old business practice across the entire economy,” Joseffer said.If the rule is allowed to stand, it opens “a pandora’s box, where they can micromanage any aspect of the economy,” the Chamber’s chief policy officer, Neil Bradley, asserted.In December of last year, New York State Governor Kathleen Hochul vetoed a bill passed by the state legislature to completely ban noncompete agreements in that state.<h2>What employees should know now</h2>A nationwide ban on noncompete clauses can make things easier for rank-and-file workers who want to change jobs and not fear retaliation from their former employer.“Having a bright line saying you can’t do it at all would be a major help to employees,” said employee-side attorney Anne Clark at Vladeck, Raskin & Clark P.C.But unless and until a nationwide ban goes into effect, any employee who has already signed a noncompete or is being asked to do so should understand the contours of it.“Understand what you’re being asked to sign. And if you don’t, ask questions,” said Amanda Wait, a partner at the law firm DLA Piper and a former lawyer with the FTC.You might start by checking the particulars of the law in your state governing employee agreements and what, if any prohibitions there are on employers. You might also consult with an attorney to help you interpret your noncompete, since courts may use a lot of different factors in determining whether a noncompete is unfairly restrictive, Clark said.This story has been updated with additional information.",2024-04-24 00:06:00 AM EEST,CNN,FTC votes to ban most employers from using noncompete clauses.

Bryan Mena,"Sales of newly built single-family homes in the United States soared in March despite mortgage rates remaining elevated that month.New home sales, which make up about 10% of the market, jumped 8.8% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 693,000, according to government figures released Tuesday. That trounced the 670,000 rate projected by economists, according to a FactSet poll, and was the strongest monthly increase since December 2022.Sales of new homes increased across the country last month, rising the most in the Northeast region by a robust 27.8% from February.Meanwhile, sales of existing homes, which make up the vast majority of the housing market, fell 4.3% in March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.19 million, the sharpest drop in more than a year, the National Association of Realtors reported last week.<h2>Housing market poised to remain difficult</h2>The broader US housing market is expected to remain tough for Americans, with mortgage rates poised to stay well above 6% this year, economists say. The Federal Reserve doesn’t directly set mortgage rates, but its actions do influence them, and the central bank isn’t expected to cut interest rates anytime soon. A persistent undersupply of housing also remains a key pressure point in the market, contributing to low affordability.Housing inventory has improved in recent months, but supply still isn’t keeping up with demand. This means homebuyers have limited options as some homeowners who locked in a low mortgage rate before the Fed began to hike rates in 2022 largely prefer to not sell their homes.“Despite high prices and mortgage rates, homebuyers have limited options on the resale market, although resale inventories have improved some over the course of this year,” Gregg Logan, managing director at RCLCO Real Estate Consulting, said in a note Tuesday.“The willingness of the major homebuilders to utilize incentives such as price reductions, mortgage rate buy-downs and paying buyers closings costs continue to support a healthy pace of new home sales,” he added.<h2>A stalled housing market recovery?</h2>The housing market began the year with some momentum as home sales surged, homebuilder sentiment perked up and inventory levels climbed, but now it seems to have fizzled out.In addition to the March drop in existing home sales, residential construction of single-family homes also fell that month, declining 12.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.022 million units, according to Commerce Department data released earlier this month. Residential construction fell throughout the country except in the West. Meanwhile, building permits for future construction tumbled 3.7% in March to a five-month low.Data from the National Association of Home Builders showed that 22% of builders cut homes prices in April, down from 24% in March. Meanwhile, the share of builders who offered a sales incentive edged lower to 57% in April from 60% in March. Sentiment among homebuilders in America held steady in April, NAHB said.“April’s flat reading suggests potential for demand growth is there, but buyers are hesitating until they can better gauge where interest rates are headed,” NAHB’s chief economist, Robert Dietz, said in a release.This story has been updated with additional context.",2024-04-23 18:19:00 PM EEST,CNN,US new home sales surged in March despite elevated mortgage rates,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/23/economy/new-home-sales-march/index.html
Chris Isidore,"Tesla reported its first quarter adjusted earnings plunged 48%, falling short of lowered Wall Street forecasts, but it assured investors that it plans to move ahead with a cheaper model due out next year.The company reported a 9% drop in total revenue, which also missed analyst estimates. And its profit margin declined by 2 percentage points.But Tesla heartened some investors by announcing it plans to move ahead with a lower priced model, which it said will go into production in the second half of 2025.Tesla did not give much in the way of details about this new, lower-priced model it is promising, such as a target price or its production volumes. And CEO Elon Musk and Tesla have a history of not living up to timelines on vehicle launches. But the promise that it is still moving ahead with a lower-priced model was assuring news in the wake of reports that it would drop plans for the vehicle altogether.Musk seemed unexcited even talking about the new lower priced model, seeming to compare it to a horse-drawn carriage, and spending far more of the call with investors hyping Tesla’s promises far beyond its current or future electric vehicles. He once again cited the company’s artificial intelligence capabilities and its self-driving technology, which he predicted could be licensed to one or more rival automakers later this year. And he spoke of its plans for sentient humanoid robots, and his vision of a fleet of millions driverless “robotaxis” owned by a combination of Tesla and Tesla owners, moving passengers who will be as comfortable riding in a driverless car as they are walking onto an elevator today.“We really should be thought of as an AI-robotics company,” he said. “If you value Tesla as just an auto company, it’s just the wrong framework. If somebody doesn’t believe that Tesla will solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company.”It was a classic Musk call straight out of the earlier days of Tesla when the company was still struggling financiallly, promising paradigm shifting technological changes to get investors excited about the future.And to a degree, it worked, with the recently battered Tesla (TSLA) shares, which had lost 42% of their value so far this year through Tuesday’s close, rising 11% in after-market trading, despite the ugly financial performance reported for the first quarter.Tesla and Musk were eager to change the story around Tesla, not just away from disappointing first quarter financial results, but also from a sustained run of bad news. Earlier this month, it reported its first year-over-year decline in global sales since the pandemic and unveiled plans to cut more than 10% of its staff. It also continued its year-long series of price cuts, with the most recent coming last weekend.The drop in stock value has even some Tesla bulls worried about the future for the world’s most valuable automaker. But it is facing increasing competition from both established Western automakers — which are rolling out their own EV offerings — and Chinese automakers, which are offering low-priced EVs.In the final three months of last year, Tesla lost its title as the world’s largest EV maker to Chinese automaker BYD.After Reuters reported earlier this month that Tesla was dropping plans for a cheaper model, popularly referred to as the Tesla Model 2, because of competition from China, CEO Elon Musk tweeted “Reuters is lying (again),” without giving any details of the company’s plans. But in January, he did warn that Chinese automakers could ‘demolish’ rivals with low priced EVs.Tesla adjusted net income came in at $1.5 billion, or 45 cents a share. Analysts had been forecasting earnings per share of 49 cents. It was the smallest adjusted quarterly profit that Tesla had reported since the first quarter of 2021, when the pandemic and supply chain disruptions were still affecting results.The company also said it had negative cash flow of $2.5 billion, the first time it had burned through cash in a quarter since the first quarter of 2020 at the start of the pandemic.The company said it experienced numerous challenges in the first quarter, from the conflict in the Red Sea, which caused ships heading from Asia to Europe to take a longer path around Africa, to an arson attack at its plant in Germany and a gradual ramp up of the updated Model 3 at its plant in Fremont, California.",2024-04-24 02:35:00 AM EEST,CNN,"Tesla’s earnings plunge, but the company promises cheaper car model",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/23/business/tesla-report-earnings-result/index.html
"Chris Isidore,John Fritze","Starbucks and the National Labor Relations Board, the federal agency charged with protecting workers’ rights, will battle each other before the Supreme Court Tuesday, in one of numerous cases now pending in which major employers are questioning the NLRB’s powers and even its right to exist.The NLRB under the labor-friendly Biden administration has been overseeing a period of significantly more organizing and strike activities by the nation’s unions. Some high-profile companies are complaining that the agency is abusing its powers. The companies are asking federal courts, often with conservative, pro-business judges, to stop the agency from standing behind the more activist unions now making their lives more difficult.Tuesday’s Supreme Court case involves the NLRB’s powers to get employees whom it judges were wrongly fired for union activity immediately rehired, rather than forcing them to go through a long, drawn-out court process. At issue are seven employees Starbucks fired at a store in Memphis in 2022 that the union said were attempting to organize. The employees, known as the “Memphis 7,” have become a nationwide symbol for labor supporters.Starbucks is arguing that the NLRB’s powers are not being applied uniformly across the country because some federal courts, including the courts that reviewed the Memphis 7 case, are using what critics describe as a more lenient standard to force employers to take preliminary action. In this case, the lower courts required Starbucks to reinstate the employees it had fired.“The NLRB has long used the federal courts … to obtain injunctions … before the merits of an unfair labor practice case are fully evaluated,” said a statement from Starbucks. “As a company, we felt obligated to stand up for what is right, not only for our partners and our company, but also for the employers across the country who are subject to NLRB requests for injunctions in federal courts.”But the NLRB argues that the only way to protect workers who are improperly terminated for union activity is to allow it to go to federal court and get immediate action against the offending employer, as it successfully did in the case of the Memphis employees.“Injunctive relief is one of the most important tools available to the NLRB to protect workers’ statutory rights through effective enforcement of the only federal labor law in the country,” said Jennifer Abruzzo, the NLRB’s General Counsel, in a statement about the case.“Congress … has empowered the agency to seek this interim relief to immediately end violative conduct and restore the status quo at the workplace while the board’s administrative process proceeds,” Abruzzo said. “Without obtaining this temporary relief, the lawbreaker will fully reap the benefits of having violated workers’ rights — such as by snuffing out a nascent organizing drive — through the passage of time.”<h2>Justices’ tough questions for the NLRB</h2>During arguments Tuesday, Starbucks’ attorney argued that the NLRB has too much power to get an injunction to order fired workers returned to work, without the district court getting to weigh evidence in the case itself.“Preliminary injunctions are extraordinary and drastic remedies,” said Lisa Blatt, a veteran Supreme Court litigator and Starbucks’ attorney in the case. “Such relief is highly inappropriate absent a clear showing.”Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson questioned how the NLRB could be abusing its powers, as Starbucks was arguing, given that there had been only 14 instances of the board seeking such injunctions in the last year out of the thousands of cases it considered.“If we’re worried about an abusive board doing things it’s not supposed to be [doing], giving undue deference, it seems like the board is pretty careful when it’s determining whether or not to even seek these injunctions since it’s only asked for it 14 times,” she said.But both conservative and liberal justices posed tough questions to the government, pressing the Biden administration’s attorney on why lower courts should review labor cases any differently than other controversies involving government agencies.“The district court is an independent check,” conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett said. “So, it seems like it should be just doing what district courts do.”Justice Elena Kagan, a member of the court’s liberal wing, appeared to agree, suggesting that lower federal courts should do “what courts normally do, which is applying the law as the court finds it to a case.”Those questions appeared to cut against the arguments raised by the government that courts should give some special deference to the NLRB’s read on a dispute between employers and employees.Justice Neil Gorsuch, a conservative member of the court, pointed out that “in all sorts of alphabet soup agencies, we don’t do this. District courts apply the likelihood of success test as we generally perceive it. So why is this particular statutory regime different from so many others?”And Chief Justice John Roberts suggested that attorneys for both the government and Starbucks could agree, “we can dispose of this in a short opinion,” prompting laughter in the courtroom.The labor law that controls what happens if an employer illegally fires a worker for supporting a union doesn’t give the workers much in the way of relief. The employer could be forced to provide back pay for the time since the improper firing, but that amount would be reduced by whatever pay the worker received at a job they held in the meantime. The employer doesn’t have to pay any interest, penalty or fine, to the fired workers, their union or the agency.“The remedies against the employer are so pathetically weak they’re almost an invitation to violate the law,” said Cathy Creighton, an NLRB attorney during the Clinton administration and a union lawyer who now serves as the head of the Buffalo, New York office of Cornell University’s school of Industrial and Labor Relations.While this is the first such case to reach the Supreme Court, other cases are emerging in which some high profile employers are challenging the agency’s right to exist. The Supreme Court’s decision is expected by the end of June.<h2>Other challenges to NLRB</h2>Rocket company SpaceX filed two federal lawsuits so far this year questioning the constitutionality of the agency itself after the NLRB announced it was looking at complaints from eight former employees of the nonunion rocket company who said they were fired for writing company management begging them to publicly condemn CEO Elon Musk’s “harmful” behavior on social media.Three other companies — Starbucks, Amazon and Trader Joe’s — have raised similar arguments in cases still before the NLRB’s administrative law judges, although they have not taken the case to federal court as SpaceX has done and have not joined its suit.The constitutionality of the NLRB was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1937, two years after the agency was created during the New Deal, said Cornell’s Creighton.She said the Supreme Court’s rulings with the current conservative majority on some other cases involving unions makes her worried that it is poised to rule against the agency on this case. And she’s also worried that if the question of constitutionality of the NLRB were to reach the high court, it could rule against the agency as well.“They’re seeking to annihilate the board,” she said about the employers’ challenges to the NLRB. “I’m worried because this court is not ruled by precedent the way other courts have been. Just taking up the issue, they’re signaling they’re not particularly labor friendly.”",2024-04-23 20:06:00 PM EEST,CNN,Federal labor board has been much more pro-worker under Biden.

Amy Woodyatt,"At 23, only a few years into her professional surfing career, Becca Speak was sponsored by brands including Billabong, entering competitions and performing at the top of her game. She was enjoying her life and had lots to look forward to.But in an instant, she says, the sport that had given her life so much meaning “took so much away from me” when she sustained a serious head injury during a surf competition and was left unable to speak.“As soon as I hit my head, I went paralyzed for a moment,” Speak told CNN Sport of the accident, which took place in a concrete wave pool.“I didn’t really know what was happening. I just knew I couldn’t move my body, and I remember just being under the water, like, just crying, ‘please, please, please’ … not quite sure what’s happening, but I just knew I couldn’t move, and it was really scary.”Dragged from the water by friends who were watching her compete, Speak wasn’t sure whether something was seriously wrong but went to the hospital as the injury had left her bleeding. On the way, she started to experience delays with her speech.“It felt like the connection from my brain to my mouth wasn’t quite there,” she adds, but she returned home after hospital scans showed that “everything looked okay structurally.”But over the course of the few days, Speak says, she felt a little bit worse.“Eventually I felt like I was falling into a vegetative state, almost. I could barely put a couple words together. I was very overstimulated by the smallest things, just the sound of someone talking or the light from my phone or outside. Everything was just really overwhelming.”After a second trip to hospital, doctors confirmed that Speak had sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI), her sixth after a lifetime of enjoying sports including gymnastics, skiing, snowboarding, skateboarding and swimming.What followed was a grueling months-long recovery consisting of physical and cognitive therapy, a journey that is chronicled in the new film “Beyond Normal.”It took the surfer some three months to regain her normal speech patterns and even longer before she felt physically and mentally well again, thanks to neurological treatments, hyperbaric oxygen therapy and transcranial magnetic stimulation, and physical rehabilitation.“Most of the time, people tell you, ‘Oh, you’re fine. Shake it off,’ because brain injuries are an invisible injury they can’t really see or no one can see what’s happening, you know, on the inside, because you look fine from the outside,” explains Speak.<h2>A lifelong journey</h2>“I think this is a comeback story that maybe has been told a few times before, but I would think one of the unique parts of Becca’s story is how she’s explored all of these new evolving technologies that exist that didn’t exist five, 10 years ago,” director and filmmaker Jordyn Romero tells CNN.Romero has her own experience with head injuries, after sustaining a TBI snowboarding while she was in high school.“I don’t remember a whole week of my life. It was a pretty serious brain injury,” she told CNN Sport.However, she returned to cross-country training just a week later, thinking she had healed – and still feels some of the effects today.Romero and co-director Anna Wilder Burns wanted to use Speak’s story to raise awareness of the impact of brain injuries.Burns, who was a gymnast turned diver in college, says her understanding of concussions as an athlete growing up was similar to a lot of coaches, which is: you can’t see it, so it doesn’t feel as real as something like a broken ankle.“I had a teammate who had a really long concussion recovery, and I remember being kind of confused, like, ‘why is it taking so long? It’s a concussion,’ ” Burns adds.A concussion happens after a “bump, blow, or jolt to the head” or “a hit to the body that causes the head and brain to move quickly back and forth,” according to guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Any of these sudden movements can cause “the brain to bounce around or twist in the skull,” “chemical changes in the brain” and/or the “stretching and damaging” of brain cells, the CDC says.These changes can lead to symptoms, such as feeling dizzy or disoriented in the moment, or longer-lasting issues with sleep, memory, learning and even personality changes.Additionally, experts warn that subconcussive head impacts – repetitive hits to the head and body that do not cause symptoms – can still result in long-term neurological disease.The filmmakers credit a close and trusting relationship with Speak as key to allowing them to make an “intimate and vulnerable” film about her recovery, which took over two years to film.Throughout her treatment, Speak realized she had been living with the effects of her untreated head injuries for most of her adult life.While trying to get back to “normal,” she says, she realized she didn’t even know what that would mean, given the effect of her previous injuries.“A doctor one day said, ‘you have to get beyond what you think is normal.’ And that sort of became a mantra for me throughout the healing journey,” she explains.“This is just going to be a sort of lifelong journey for me, I think, and I’ve accepted that, and I’m OK with it,” Speak adds.The surfer says she has found a way to immerse herself in surfing once more, a sport that she “fell in love with” because “it was so free: it’s just you and Mother Nature.”Her accident almost changed that, she tells CNN, admitting that for a year, “I didn’t know if I ever even wanted to surf again.”“I had a lot of resentment towards surfing, because it took so much away from me.”However, she eventually got to thinking she might try it again – even if it was scary. Now, Speak once again surfs every day but now wears a foam helmet.“It’s like the next chapter of my life, and my goals are bigger than ever. Some days are still harder than others, and I’m trying to find that balance of pushing myself but also taking the time to rest and recover so I can accomplish all the things I want to do,” she adds.",2024-04-10 20:19:00 PM EEST,CNN,"A surfing injury left her unable to talk.

Oliver Darcy,"Editor’s Note: A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.Donald Trump and his allies like to complain at length about imagined “collusion” between the Democratic Party and the media. But on Tuesday, former National Enquirer boss David Pecker lifted the curtain on the actual media collusion that took place in the 2016 election.Pecker revealed in granular detail how Trump worked hand-in-hand with the infamous national tabloid to boost his candidacy and, perhaps far more importantly, simultaneously smear his political opponents with shameful lies and innuendo.“I said what I would do is I would run or publish positive stories about Mr. Trump and I would publish negative stories about his opponents,” Pecker said under oath at Trump’s historic hush-money trial in New York. “I said I would be your eyes and ears because I know that the Trump Organization has a very small staff.”The highly-anticipated court appearance from Pecker, who was granted immunity in exchange for his candid testimony at the trial, put a floodlight on the dark underbelly of the Enquirer, with the tabloid portrayed in open court as a tawdry publication willfully serving as a political weapon for Trump — truth and basic ethics be damned.Pecker spoke at length about how he worked with former Trump attorney Michael Cohen to “catch and kill” stories that could have damaged the then-candidate, such as former Playboy model Karen McDougal’s allegations of an affair, which the Enquirer paid $130,000 to bury. Pecker said that at the outset of the campaign he believed “there would be a lot of women who would come out to try to sell their stories” about Trump because he was “well known as the most eligible bachelor.”To that end, Pecker said he served as Trump’s eyes and ears, alerting the then-candidate’s camp to potentially embarrassing stories that hovered on the horizon. In fact, Pecker was so determined to protect Trump that he even purchased a story from Manhattan doorman Dino Sajudin, despite believing it to be bogus. That story, which the Enquirer paid $30,000 for, alleged Trump had fathered an illegitimate child, prompting the tabloid to deploy a team of reporters to chase down the truth. While Pecker eventually determined the story was false, his publication paid five figures for the story anyway.“If there was any rumors in the marketplace about Mr. Trump or his family or any negative stories that were coming out or things that I heard overall that I would go through, I would call Michael Cohen directly,” Pecker said.Meanwhile, Pecker worked with Cohen to smear Trump’s Republican rivals in the 2016 primary, including Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio. Pecker testified that the Enquirer would “communicate what we were doing at the direction of the article from Michael Cohen,” even sending the then-Trump lawyer PDF copies of the stories in advance.“He would comment on them, so we would add content based on the information Cohen provided them,” Pecker said.At times, Pecker said that Cohen went as far as to contact him and direct the Enquirer to attack Trump’s GOP rivals.“Michael Cohen would call me and say, ‘We would like you to run a negative article on a certain — let’s say for argument sake — on Ted Cruz, then he — Michael Cohen — would send me information about Ted Cruz or Ben Carson or Marco Rubio, and that was the basis of our story and then we would embellish it from there,” Pecker told the courtroom.When the Enquirer published negative stories about Bill and Hillary Clinton, Pecker said that Trump was elated.“He was pleased,” Pecker recalled.The relationship, however, between Trump and Pecker was kept secret from staff. Pecker, who revealed in court he operated a clandestine email account that his assistant did not have access to or know about, said he feared leaks and didn’t want “anyone to know” about the pact he had with Trump. Paranoid about the mutually beneficial relationship making its way to the press, Pecker only told select people about it, including then-top editor, Dylan Howard.“I told him we’re going to try to help the campaign, and to do that, I want to keep this as quiet as possible,” Pecker said.While the days of the Enquirer boosting Trump while publishing false and sleazy stories about his opponents are over, the habit remains prevalent in right-wing media. Far more powerful outlets, such as Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News, continue to debase themselves in service of Trump, acting as his propaganda vehicles.Case in point: While MAGA Media would be apoplectic if President Joe Biden were being tried in criminal court, coverage has been scant and/or bent in favor of Trump in right-wing media. Fox News on Tuesday barely covered the explosive revelations from Pecker. And when the outlet did offer its audience coverage of the trial, it was through an unmistakable pro-Trump lens. Meanwhile, Fox News and other right-wing outlets continue to launch ugly — and often dishonest — attacks on Biden.As it turns out, there will always be grossly unethical behavior among those in partisan media. And Trump knows precisely how to exploit that fact to his advantage — a reality that the hush-money case is underscoring for the sect of the public not locked in his warped propaganda universe.",2024-04-24 13:43:00 PM EEST,CNN,Former National Enquirer boss reveals sleazy tactics the tabloid used to protect Donald Trump and smear his rivals,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/24/media/national-enquirer-trump-protect-smear/index.html
Jack Bantock,"Texting on the Moon? Streaming on Mars? It may not be as far away as you think.That’s the shared vision of NASA and Nokia, who have partnered to set up a cellular network on the Moon to help lay the building blocks for long-term human presence on other planets.A SpaceX rocket is due to launch this year — the exact date has yet to be confirmed — carrying a simple 4G network to the Moon. The lander will install the system at the Moon’s south pole and then it will be remotely controlled from Earth.“The first challenge to getting a network up and running is having a space-qualified cellular equipment that meets the appropriate size, weight, and power requirements, as well as being deployed without a technician,” Walt Engelund, deputy associate administrator for programs at NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate, told CNN. No less of a challenge, it will need to operate in the harsh lunar environment of extreme temperatures and radiation.The 4G network unit is being built by Nokia’s Bell Labs using a range of off-the-shelf commercial components. It will be loaded onto a lander made by US company Intuitive Machines, and once deployed it will connect the lander via radio equipment to two roaming vehicles with their own special mission: to search for ice.One of the vehicles, the Lunar Outpost rover, will explore the area known as Shackleton Connecting Ridge, while the other, the Micro-Nova hopper, will plunge into a crater to scan for unprecedented up-close evidence of Moon ice.Images of ice — transmitted back to the lander and then Earth in near real-time via the cellular network — would be a world-first. Lunar ice could be used to create breathable oxygen, and even fuel that could eventually be used to launch Mars missions from the Moon.For NASA’s Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the moon this decade, cellular connectivity is invaluable.Currently, astronauts talk to each other by radio, but NASA wants a lunar communications system capable of supporting high-resolution video and science data, said Engelund — especially as Artemis missions become more sophisticated.“Being able to communicate on the Moon is critical to Artemis — as critical as any other mission element like power, water to drink, and air to breathe,” said Engelund.“Eventually, this effort will help establish a lunar communications network that could give our explorers the ability to beam scientific data back, confer with mission control, and talk to their families, as if they were walking down the street on their cellphones.”It could lay the groundwork for an off-world internet not dissimilar to that of Earth’s. Personal devices could connect to such networks, allowing ﻿space colonists to use smartphones that can access all the apps and services available to those back on Earth.NASA selected Bell Labs as part of its Tipping Point initiative, a series of partnerships with companies to develop technologies for future missions that puts them in prime position for key roles in the future space economy.Bell Labs was given a $14.1 million grant in 2020, and in January, Nokia was selected by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to begin working on a communications services infrastructure that will eventually serve as the “framework for the lunar economy.”“A future lunar economy will critically depend on communication technologies to collect and analyze data, share information, and maintain and control operations,” Thierry Klein, president of Bell Labs Solutions Research, told CNN.“This includes sustaining a semi-permanent or permanent human presence on the Moon, as well as automated robotic operations for transportation, resource mining, mineral processing and scientific data collection.”There are potential commercial benefits for Earthly business ventures too.If a network can withstand the journey into orbit, then deploy and endure autonomously amid the vacuum of space, wildly fluctuating temperatures and cosmic radiation, it will be able to survive the harshest locations on Earth — such as polar ice caps, deserts, or offshore platforms.“Especially when it comes to remote deployments, industrial sites, public safety, emergency response, disaster recovery or defense, it is highly beneficial to have compact, low-footprint network equipment that can be easily transported and deployed anywhere,” Klein said.",2024-04-24 14:27:00 PM EEST,CNN,Streaming and texting on the Moon: Nokia and NASA are taking 4G into space,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/24/tech/nokia-moon-4g-network-nasa-spc/index.html
Hilary Whiteman,"In one camp is a tech billionaire with more than 181 million followers on his own social network. In the other, political leaders representing a country of just 26 million people.Insults have been hurled for days by both sides in an increasingly bare-knuckled fight between X owner Elon Musk and the Australian government that’s playing out both online and in the Federal Court.At issue is the right of X to publish a video showing the moment a 16-year-old allegedly stabbed a bishop in an Orthodox Christian Church in Sydney earlier this month.Australian authorities say the clips threw fuel on a riot that erupted outside the church after the attack and shouldn’t be available for general viewing on a global platform, where it could be used to radicalize potential offenders.The country’s e-safety commissioner ordered social media giants to take it down.Most complied, but X didn’t go far enough, according to the commissioner.Australia wants X to remove the video completely, not just hide it from Australian users who could circumvent a local ban by using virtual private networks.X says that’s an assault on free speech.“Our concern is that if ANY country is allowed to censor content for ALL countries, which is what the Australian ‘eSafety Commissar’ is demanding, then what is to stop any country from controlling the entire Internet? Musk posted on X.Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Tuesday labelled Musk an “arrogant billionaire who thinks he’s above the law, but also above common decency.”After deleting her X account and urging other politicians to do the same, Jacqui Lambie, a straight-talking senator and former soldier from Tasmania, posted an image of herself on Facebook dressed in army fatigues with a message to Musk to “put his big boy pants on and do the right thing.”The post dropped around midnight in the United States, and as of writing, the X boss hadn’t responded. Though her previous calls on national television for Musk to be jailed resulted in him branding her “an enemy of the people of Australia.”X did not reply to a request for comment.<h2>The right to view</h2>On Wednesday, more than a week after the attack, the video was still available to view on the X account of the Australian Jewish Association (AJA). President David Adler told CNN he hadn’t been asked to take it down, either by X or Australia’s e-safety commissioner.Adler said the AJA received an email from X saying Australian authorities had contacted the company with a takedown request, noting the video “violates the law(s) of Australia.”According to the email, seen by CNN, X said: “We want you to have an opportunity to evaluate the request and, if you wish, take appropriate action to protect your interests.”The AJA hasn’t taken the video down, because Adler believes it’s important for people to see.“The reason we did that is because security issues are of critical interest to the Jewish community,” said Adler. “Politicians are not adequately taking the risks of extremism seriously enough. And one of the benefits of showing exactly what happened is a public awakening. Politicians often won’t act without public pressure and there needs to be a bit of an awakening about the risk.”CNN contacted the eSafety office for comment about the AJA’s decision not to remove the video.On Wednesday, the risks of extremism became apparent with a series of raids at 13 locations in Sydney by the Joint Counter Terrorism Team related to the church attack.Seven youths, age 15 to 17, were arrested and five were helping police with their inquiries, Australian Federal Police (AFP) Deputy Commissioner Krissy Barrett told a news conference.“We identified links between the alleged offender and a network of associates and peers who we believe shared a similar violent extremist ideology,” she said. “At this time, we have no evidence of specific locations, times or targets of a violent act.”The arrests came as the heads of the AFP and Australia’s Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) gave a joint address to the National Press Club warning that the risks are extreme — and urging social media companies to work with police against forces seeking to radicalize children.“Some of our children and other vulnerable people are being bewitched online by a cauldron of extremist poison on the open and dark web. And that’s one serious problem. The other is that the very nature of social media allows that extremist poison to spray across the globe almost instantaneously,” said AFP Commissioner Reece Kershaw.<h2>Musk versus Australia</h2>Musk’s refusal to take down the videos resulted in Australia’s e-safety commissioner taking legal action on X to act or risk fines of up to 782,500 Australian dollars ($508,000) for each day of non-compliance.On Wednesday, the parties were back in the Federal Court in Sydney, where X lawyer Marcus Hoyne made clear that the social media platform hadn’t changed its position and would fight what he called the commissioner’s attempted reach over an “exorbitant jurisdiction.”He said X would file an affidavit from Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel, the cleric who was stabbed multiple times during the church attack, “stating that he is strongly of the view that the material should be available.”Christ The Good Shepherd Church, where the attack happened, declined to comment when contacted by CNN.Joanne Gray, a lecturer in digital cultures at the University of Sydney, said the e-safety commissioner’s attempt to extend the takedown orders beyond Australia’s borders was not an overreach.“There’s a long history of platforms working with policymakers and civil society and different groups to moderate content, and Musk’s position is a deviation from that,” she told CNN.Gray said taking down harmful material in the jurisdiction where it was published typically limits its spread and any potential harm caused, though conceded the system isn’t perfect.Gray said Musk was trying to apply his stated belief in free speech absolutism to Australia, not to set a precedent for other platforms to follow.“It’s extremely problematic that any individual has control over a communication platform that has the potential to reach a global audience in a way that is unaccountable,” she said.Musk’s fight with the Australian government is one of many the billionaire is waging against authorities he accuses of imposing limits on free speech.Since Musk bought X, formerly known as Twitter, in 2022, he has stripped back its content moderation and reinstated some previously blocked accounts, earning him strong support from loyal followers.In a statement Wednesday, Australia’s eSafety commissioner said the takedown request wasn’t designed to stifle discussion about the church attack.“The removal notice given to X Corp does not relate to commentary, public debate or other posts about this event, even those which may link to extreme violent content. It only concerns the video of the violent stabbing attack,” it said.Musk’s supporters have applauded the billionaire’s stance in Australia and taken aim at his critics.Lambie’s office confirmed there had been an increase in the trolling of her Facebook account, and Wednesday’s post was closed for comments in order to discourage more.The court granted a further injunction requiring X to hide the violent material until May 10, when all parties will return to court.",2024-04-24 14:30:00 PM EEST,CNN,Australia is taking on ‘arrogant billionaire’ Elon Musk over violent images on X,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/24/media/australia-elon-musk-x-sydney-church-stabbing-hnk-intl/index.html
George Ramsay,"German surfer Sebastian Steudtner may have broken his own record for riding the biggest wave in history earlier this year.The monster wave in the famed surfing sport of Nazaré, Portugal was provisionally measured at 28.57 meters (93.72 feet), pending ratification.If confirmed, the wave would eclipse Steudtner’s current record of 26.21 meters (86 feet) set in 2020, also in the fishing village of Nazaré.In a post on Instagram, Steudtner described the feat in February as “surfing the unsurfable” alongside footage of the wave, a foaming mass of white water trailing in his wake.“The record to me is definitely secondary to actually riding the wave and everything that goes into it,” he told CNN Sport on Monday. “I think what was special about this last big day in February was that we surfed conditions that never have been surfed before.”Porsche, which had a role in measuring the wave, said that the height was determined using drone technology developed by Team Steudtner and Porsche Engineering. Traditionally, record-breaking waves have been measured by analyzing video footage and images.“It was a challenge to develop a drone that can measure not only the height of the waves but is also capable of tracking the surfer within the radius throughout the entire wave ride,” said Marcus Schmelz, project manager at Porsche Engineering.The World Surf League, the sport’s global governing body, will have to confirm whether the wave from the February 24 event is an official world record.That day produced historic conditions at Nazaré – so much so that the organizer of the big-wave event, Gigantes de Nazaré, asked on its Instagram feed if some of the waves, such as one surfed by Brazilian Lucas “Chumbo” Chianca, could have even exceeded the mythical mark of 100 feet (just over 30 meters).“It was not just the biggest storm and the biggest waves in the past three or four years, but it was also a proper storm,” Steudtner told CNN Sport.“We were, for the first time, surfing the biggest waves in stormy conditions which were considered unsurfable. We made that possible and that to me is what’s special from that day.”The swells of the Atlantic Ocean and a deep canyon close to the shoreline make Nazaré a spectacular location for those hoping to surf some of the world’s biggest waves.The 38-year-old Steudtner, like many of his peers, relocates to the west coast of Portugal for the big-wave season, which lasts from October to March.He has adopted a scientific approach in his quest to surf a wave more than 100-feet tall, honing his craft in wind tunnels usually reserved for Porsche’s car testing and partnering with tech company Siemens as part of a project researching the biomechanics of big-wave surfing.CNN’s Ben Church contributed to reporting.",2024-04-22 19:50:00 PM EEST,CNN,Sebastian Steudtner says he has surfed the ‘unsurfable’ after drone technology measures 93.7-foot wave as world record,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/22/sport/sebastian-steudtner-record-breaking-wave-surfing-spt-intl/index.html
Andrew McNicol,"Teenage Indian chess prodigy Gukesh Dommaraju, better known as Gukesh D, became the youngest player to claim the men’s Candidates Tournament in Toronto, Canada Sunday.The 17-year-old grandmaster’s win sets up an opportunity to dethrone reigning world champion Ding Liren of China at the 2024 World Chess Championship later this year.Should Gukesh beat Ding, who has struggled with poor form recently, he will break Garry Kasparov’s long-held record of being the youngest world champion aged 22.Gukesh, ranked 16th in the world by the International Chess Federation (FIDE), sealed his title after a comfortable draw with world number 3 Hikaru Nakamura, a five-time US chess champion who is more than twice his age.Gukesh is set to become the youngest player ever to challenge for a world chess title.“I was completely emotional but after the game I’m feeling quite good,” Gukesh said in a press conference after finishing atop the round robin tournament.“I don’t really care about [being] the youngest and all these records, but it’s a nice thing to say.”Gukesh was swarmed by Indian fans outside his hotel as the South Asian nation celebrates yet another young chess talent.“I’m very excited to play in the world championship and really looking forward to all the preparations,” he said, adding that his journey is “only halfway through.”The previous youngest winner of a Candidates tournament was Russian prodigy Kasparov, then 20, in 1984.Kasparov, who went on to win multiple world championships, praised Gukesh and the conveyor belt of chess talent coming from both Asia and Asian diaspora communities in countries like the United Stated and Britain.“The Indian earthquake in Toronto is the culmination of the shifting tectonic plates in the chess world,” Kasparov wrote on social media platform X.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also praised Gukesh’s “remarkable achievement” and “extraordinary talent and dedication” on social media.Gukesh will face 31-year-old Chinese star Ding, who was crowed world champion in 2023. The title was previously held by five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen, who had decided not to defend his title at the time.Ding became the first Chinese men’s player in history to become world champion. But the now-world number 5 immediately took a nine-month break from competitions and has struggled with form upon returning.The date and location of the 2024 World Chess Championship between Ding and Gukesh has yet to be revealed.China’s Tan Zhongyi won the women’s Challenger category to qualify for a world title match against compatriot and reigning world champion Ju Wenjun – date also unknown.India, meanwhile, is not short of young chess talent.Joining Gukesh in the men’s Candidates tournament was Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa (R Praggnanandhaa), 18, who famously stunned the chess world by beating  Carlsen in 2022.“Pragg”, as he is known to fans, became the youngest international chess master at the age of 10 and the second-youngest grandmaster in the world at 12. Last year, he and his sister, 22-year-old Rameshbabu Vaishali (R Vaishali), became the first-ever brother and sister duo to obtain grandmaster titles.Gukesh is the second Indian to play in a world championship after legendary Indian player Viswanathan “Vishy” Anand.Gukesh overtook Anand, a five-time world champion and the country’s top player for nearly 40 years, to become India’s top-ranked player last September.“I’m personally very proud of how (Gukesh) played and handled tough situations.

Jack Bantock,"You know the drill by now. A golf tournament is staged. After four rounds the tournament concludes. Scottie Scheffler poses with the winner’s trophy.Just a week on from conquering a windswept Masters, the world No. 1 mastered the elements once more at a stormy RBC Heritage to reel in his fourth win in his last five starts.Thunderstorms in South Carolina had delayed Sunday’s action for two-and-a-half hours before play was suspended due to darkness, leaving Scheffler to return to Harbor Town Golf Links on Monday to finish his last three holes.Carrying a five-stroke advantage, a closing bogey served up no jeopardy, as the American carded a three-under-68 to finish on 19-under overall, three shots ahead of compatriot Sahith Theegala.It seals Scheffler’s 10th PGA Tour title and a tied career-high fourth of the season as the 27-year-old continues to exert a level of dominance that is drawing increasing parallels to Tiger Woods’ seemingly perpetual presence in the winner’s circle across the 2000’s.No golfer since Woods in 2006 had won a PGA Tour event the week after triumph at a major, while you would have to go back as far as Bernhard Langer in 1985 to find the last, and only previous, time that a golfer followed up victory at Augusta National with a win at Harbor Town.“I didn’t show up here just to have some sort of ceremony and have people tell me congratulations,” Scheffler told reporters Monday.“I came here with a purpose. Got off to a slow start but after that played some really nice golf.”<h2>‘Hopefully I’ll be a good Dad’</h2>Questions over whether Scheffler would tee up at the tournament had only proliferated given the imminent arrival of his first child, with wife Meredith expected to give birth within the next few weeks.The Texan had vowed to abandon his pursuit of a second career major at the Masters if his wife went into labor and stayed in close family contact this week, calling his partner on Sunday evening and seeking out parents Scott and Diane after tapping home for victory Monday.“Hopefully I’ll be a good Dad. I’m going to do my best,” said Scheffler, whose sister is also pregnant.“I was talking to Meredith on the phone last night, and we were both kind of like, ‘I don’t think it’s officially hit us yet that we’re going to be parents.’ I’ll definitely be leaning on my parents for a good amount of advice. They did a great job raising me and my three sisters.“They’re still a big part of our lives. This will be their second grandchild and they’ll have their third one on the way right after that … It’s an exciting time for Meredith and me, it’s an exciting time for the rest of our family. We’re looking forward to this next journey in our life together.”<h2>The most dominant force in golf right now? Not quite.</h2>Even the sole event Scheffler hasn’t won in his last five appearances was a runner-up finish, as he missed out by two shots to Germany’s Stephan Jaeger at the Texas Children’s Houston Open in March.To put his supremacy into context, the world ranking points gap between Scheffler (629.6) and his closest chaser Rory McIlroy (344.4) is wider than that of the Northern Irishman to world No.784 Woods (4.64), who has made just five competitive appearances since the start of 2023.Only two players had ever previously won or finished runner-up in five consecutive PGA Tour starts; Vijay Singh in 2004, and Woods on three separate occasions between 1999 and 2008.Remarkably though, it’s not even the best streak in golf right now.Compatriot Nelly Korda triumphed at the Chevron Championship on Sunday to stretch her winning run to five in a row, clinching her second major and equaling the LPGA Tour record for consecutive victories.As the 25-year-old women’s world No. 1 prepares to chase a historic sixth this week, Scheffler is throwing in the towel – but not before one last jab.“One of the people here asked me, ‘Is this turning into a competition between you and Nelly?’ and I was like, ‘I don’t know, man, I think if it’s a competition she’s got me pretty beat right now’,” Scheffler said.“She had that tied-16th at the beginning of the year, which was just terrible. I can’t believe she did that,” he added with a wry smile.“It’s pretty special stuff.

,"Aaron Boone has been tossed from an MLB game 35 times since becoming New York Yankees manager in 2018, but his most recent ejection on Monday was certainly unique.Only five pitches into the Yankees’ 2-0 loss against the Oakland Athletics, home-plate umpire Hunter Wendelstedt unambiguously told Boone that he was on his final warning after pair disagreed over a hit-by-pitch call and that he’d be ejected if he said another word.Moments later, Boone was tossed when Wendelstedt heard a shout directed towards him – despite the offending words appearing to come from a fan in the stands and not the Yankees manager himself.“It’s embarrassing, just not good,” Boone said after the game, per MLB.“I really didn’t even go after Hunter. I was more upset at the appeal. I said, ‘Hunter, you can call it, too.’ He came back at me pretty hard to which I didn’t respond. I just said, ‘OK.’”CNN has learned that it’s standard MLB policy to review all ejections and unusual on-field circumstances, with any potential disciplinary action then being announced by the league.CNN has reached out to the Yankees for comment.<h2>What even happened?</h2>Oakland’s Esteury Ruiz, the game’s first batter, was struck on the foot by a slider thrown by Carlos Rodón. Wendelstedt deferred to first-base umpire John Tumpane, who ruled that Ruiz did not swing and awarded him a hit-by-pitch, allowing him to advance to first base.Boone took issue with the call and raised it with Wendelstedt, whose blunt reply was picked up by broadcast hot mics.“Guess what? You’re not yelling at me. I did what I’m supposed to do and checked [with Tumpane],” Wendelstedt was heard saying. “I’m looking for him to get hit by the pitch. You got anything else to say, you’re gone, OK?”The cameras then cut to a frustrated – but crucially silent – Boone who appeared to stand down. Footage from YES Network then shows a fan sitting behind Boone yell something at the umpire, who then immediately turns around and throws the manager out of the game. Boone – who appeared to be chewing gum and looking at his hand during the incident that saw him ejected – and the Yankees dugout protested his innocence and immediately pointed at the stands, indicating that the comment had been made by a fan.Boone then launched into an expletive-laden rant as he pleaded his case to Wendelstedt.“I did not say a word! It was above the dugout!” he said. “I didn’t say anything! I did not say anything, Hunter!”Wendelstedt was not prepared to debate the matter.“I don’t care who said it. You’re gone!” he told Boone as jeers rained in from the New York crowd.Boone told reporters that it was “hard” to wrap his head around the decision and said that he would be reaching out to MLB about the situation.Per MLB, Wendelstedt conceded postgame that Boone “probably, you know, is not the one who made the comment,” but doubled down on his reasons for the ejection.“I know what Aaron was saying, that it was a fan above the dugout,” he said. “That’s fine and dandy. There were plenty of fans that were yelling at me before I called a pitch until the end of the game … but Aaron Boone is the manager of the New York Yankees and is responsible for everything that happens in that dugout.“In my opinion, the cheap shot came towards the far end. So instead of me being aggressive and walking down to the far end and trying to figure out who might have said it, I don’t want to eject a ballplayer. We need to keep them in the game. That’s what the fans pay to see. Aaron Boone runs the Yankees. He got ejected.”This was Boone’s second ejection of the season after being thrown out of a game against the Miami Marlins earlier this month.",2024-04-23 16:11:00 PM EEST,CNN,New York Yankees manager Aaron Boone ejected after apparent case of mistaken identity and spat with umpire,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/23/sport/aaron-boone-ejection-hunter-wendelstedt-mlb-spt-intl/index.html
Ben Morse,"Surveying her new surroundings in a Russian penal colony, the enormity of her prison confinement suddenly dawned on Brittney Griner, the WNBA star has told ABC.Speaking to ABC anchor Robin Roberts, the 33-year-old Griner said it was at that moment she “felt just less than a human.”The two-time Olympic gold-medalist spent nearly 300 days in Russian custody after being detained in February 2022 and sentenced to nine years in prison under drug-smuggling charges after authorities in the country found cannabis oil in her luggage.“There was a huge knife sitting on the table, and I was just like: ‘Now, this is going to be a ride,’” said Griner.“You got to do what you got to do to survive. The mattress had a huge blood stain on it. I had no soap, no toilet paper,” added Griner, who the US State Department deemed wrongfully detained and was released last December in a prisoner swap that involved Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout.<h2>‘My life is over right here’</h2>Griner had for years played on a Russian women’s basketball team during the WNBA off-season and was detained in a Moscow airport as she traveled to rejoin UMMC Ekaterinburg.Russian prosecutors accused her of trying to smuggle less than 1 gram of cannabis oil in her luggage contained in vape cartridges.In a portion of the interview shown on ABC on Tuesday, Griner said she “felt the cartridge” when asked to reach into her bag by airport staff.“My life is over right here,” recalls Griner of her initial reaction to that moment, while also denying that she has ever taken cannabis into Russia.Griner was eventually sentenced to nine years in prison for drug smuggling.“I was just so scared about everything. There was so much unknown,” she told ABC.When she was asked if there were times when she lost faith, Griner said: “Yeah. I didn’t think I could get through what I needed to get through.Griner, who is entering her 11th WNBA season after re-signing with the Phoenix Mercury, is writing a memoir about her experience of detention.“By writing this book, I also hope to raise awareness surrounding other Americans wrongfully detained abroad,” Griner said.Griner and her wife Cherelle are expecting their first child, the couple announced earlier this month. She is also in contention for a spot on the US Olympic team for this summer’s Paris Olympic Games.Her detainment spotlighted the salary caps WNBA players face in the US – which has pushed athletes to go overseas to earn more during their off-seasons.In 2023, Griner averaged 17.5 points, 6.3 rebounds and 2.2 assists, while ranking second in the league in field goal percentage (56.0%) and third in blocks (1.6). She is third on the WNBA’s all-time blocks list.Griner is a nine-time WNBA All-Star, winning a WNBA title in 2014.A longer version of Griner’s interview is set to air on May 1 at 10 p.m. ET on ABC’s 20/20.This story has been updated with additional information.",2024-04-23 18:07:00 PM EEST,CNN,"Brittney Griner felt ‘less than human’ while being detained in Russia, she tells ABC in interview",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/23/sport/brittney-griner-russia-prison-adjusting-abc-spt-intl/index.html
"Ben Church,Amanda Davies","Novak Djokovic said he’s “looking forward” to the chance of winning a record-breaking 25th grand slam singles title at the French Open this year.Speaking to CNN’s Amanda Davies after winning a joint-record fifth Laureus World Sportsman of the Year trophy on Monday, Djokovic said he has visualized the moment of becoming the most successful singles player – men’s or women’s – in history.The Serbian superstar has won 24 grand slam singles titles to date – the most of any man – and currently shares the all-time record with Margaret Court. He will have the chance to break the record when the French Open starts on May 20.“You take nothing but the win, that’s the mentality. You kind of visualise yourself achieving that already. So I’ve been, you know, really looking forward to it,” Djokovic said.“Of course I’m not the only one that wants to grab that title but I look forward to it. I like competing with different generations. You have the young guys who are coming up … they’re all incredibly hungry and fit and fast.“But I use my adaptability to adjust my tactics and my game to them and understand really what it takes, you know, what it takes to stay at the top and compete with these guys and try to win more titles.”Djokovic was awarded his Laureus award by NFL great Tom Brady after a remarkable 2023 season where he won three out of the four grand slams.The pair have grown close over the years and Brady praised his friend for not only being an “amazing player and talent” but “a great man, too.”“[He] has great integrity,” Brady told CNN, standing alongside Djokovic.“I think what you’ve seen over all these years, the competition always, in my view, brings out the best in people and it certainly has brought out the best in him.”Despite turning 37 later this year, Djokovic said he has no plans of slowing down and is not close to contemplating retirement.The focus, he said, is very much on the next tournament, rather than looking back on his achievements.“I feel like it’s so important to always remind yourself to be in the present moment, really to appreciate, to acknowledge, to remember where you came from, the journey, the path, also the people that surround you,” Djokovic said.“Every single week there’s something new happening and new events. So I think I will truly be able to appreciate everything that we have accomplished really, only post-career, to be honest.“Because while you’re still active … it’s what’s the next task? What’s the next challenge?“You have only maybe a few days or a week max where you’re contemplating on a great success.”If Djokovic needs any tips on preparing for retirement then Brady could be the man to turn to.The former quarterback initially retired in 2022 but came back to play one season before eventually stepping away last year.“I was very happy with the way things ended for me and now I get to sit back and watch him [Djokovic] and I got to go to the El Clásico last night,” Brady said.“You will always love the competition, that will never go away. You’ll always love the sport, but I think there’s also different ways you can contribute as you go through life.”Speaking about how elite athletes manage to adapt to retirement, Brady added: “We rarely look back. We always want to look forward because we’re ambitious people.“I think to be in this situation that we’ve been fortunate to be in, it takes a lot of ambition and it’s not like a switch you just turn off.“So you just keep going as long as you can, and you try to make the best of every opportunity you get.”",2024-04-23 15:31:00 PM EEST,CNN,Novak Djokovic tells CNN he has visualized winning record-breaking 25th grand slam title,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/23/sport/novak-djokovic-record-grand-slam-laureus-spt-intl/index.html
Andy Rose,"A woman who filed a lawsuit against former Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer, accusing him of sexual assault and battery, is now facing criminal fraud charges. Darcy Adanna Esemonu is accused of engaging in “fraudulent schemes and artifices” against Bauer and a second person.In the indictment handed up last month in Maricopa County, Arizona, Esemonu is charged with obtaining some undisclosed benefit from Bauer and another person “by means of fraudulent pretenses, representation, promises, or material omissions.” It also charges her with theft by extortion regarding the second person.The indictment does not say if Bauer has a connection to the other alleged victim.In a police report released Tuesday by Scottsdale police, Bauer alleged that Esemonu told him that she was pregnant and demanded $1.6 million in exchange for her getting an abortion.Bauer’s attorney Anne Chapman told police that Bauer did pay Esemonu approximately $10,000 for “medical expenses, prenatal vitamins, and car services related to the pregnancy.” In the police report, Chapman alleges that Esemonu was not actually pregnant at the time the demand for money was made.Esemonu’s attorney, Doug Zanes, did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the allegations.Bauer, a 33-year-old Cy Young Award winner, has not played professional baseball in the US since June 2021, when a different woman claimed he had sexually assaulted her. Bauer has never faced criminal charges, but was suspended by Major League Baseball in 2022 for what the league said was violating MLB’s joint domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse policy. The league reinstated him in December 2022, but the Dodgers cut him from the team in January 2023.Esemonu filed a civil lawsuit against Bauer in June 2023. She accused the baseball player of assaulting her several times, including sexually assaulting her in December 2020. Her complaint says she became pregnant, and he told her in March 2021 he “would not continue in a relationship with her if she decided to keep the baby.” Esemonu said she later miscarried.Bauer countersued Esemonu last year, accusing her of fraud and extortion. Both suits are still pending.When reached for reaction to the indictment against Esemonu, Bauer’s attorneys referred CNN to a video statement he released on YouTube.In it, Bauer denied ever having nonconsensual sex with Esemonu, whom he refers to by her middle name, and calls allegations against him “lies” and “an attempt to take my money.”“If there comes a time in the future where I need to defend myself further, I will not hesitate to do so,” Bauer said. “For now, there is no reason to speak further on this topic, though, because outside of Adanna – who’s now been indicted with felony fraud – there are no claims against me, no ongoing investigations, and no outstanding lawsuits.”Bauer was first accused of sexual assault by a San Diego woman, Lindsey Hill, in 2021. Prosecutors declined to file charges, and Bauer filed a defamation lawsuit against Hill in 2022, saying they had engaged in “consensual rough sex.” The defamation case and a counterclaim from Hill were settled out of court, and Hill’s lawyer told the Washington Post no money was exchanged between the parties in the settlement.",2024-04-24 05:17:00 AM EEST,CNN,Woman who accused ex-Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer of sexual assault is charged with defrauding him,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/23/sport/trevor-bauer-woman-charged-fraud-spt/index.html
"Amanda Davies,Ben Church","Real Madrid star Jude Bellingham said players should have greater involvement in how decisions are made to tackle racism in soccer.Speaking to CNN’s Amanda Davies after winning the Laureus World Sports Breakthrough of the Year award on Monday, the 20-year-old midfielder said he wanted to see tougher punishments for fans who direct racist abuse at players in the stadium.Bellingham has used his platform to speak out on the matter throughout his short career, most recently calling for more support from soccer’s governing bodies after Madrid teammate Vinícius Júnior was the subject of yet more racist abuse.“I do think there’s got to be more extreme consequences,” said Bellingham. “I think that’s the best way to try and stop people from doing it in the future,” he added.“What would be interesting is having the players involved. The players are the ones who are having to experience it, not these people in charge of the game.“So if they really want to know what they think is fair or if they are confused, there are players all over Spain and all over the world that they can speak to, and I’ll tell them to take advantage of that,” added Bellingham, who told CNN in 2022 that he questioned whether authorities cared about racist abuse directed at Black players.<h2>‘It shouldn’t be happening’</h2>Earlier this year, Brazilian superstar Vinícius Jr. broke down in tears in an emotional media conference while speaking about his experience with racist abuse while playing for Real Madrid in Spain.The 23-year-old Brazilian has been subjected to racism from fans of opposing teams on multiple occasions, including an effigy of the Brazilian being hung from a bridge before his side’s clash against city rival Atlético Madrid in January 2023 and persistent racial abuse in a match against Valencia later that year.Racist slurs have also been caught on camera during Madrid’s matches at Osasuna, Mallorca, Real Valladolid and Atlético.“I just want to play football, but it’s hard to move forward … I feel less and less like playing,” an emotional Vinícius told reporters earlier this year.Bellingham is aware it shouldn’t be up to players to solve the issues themselves, but he’s intent on raising awareness to pressure the game’s governing bodies to act.“We can all say that we want to do things or say it should change, but I think we can all come together, regardless of what color you are, to help get rid of it because we’re all on the same team at the end of the day and we all think it’s disgusting,” said Bellingham.“It shouldn’t be happening. So yeah, I look forward to seeing how the people in charge incorporate the players into the process of preventing it in the future.”CNN has reached out to La Liga and the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) for comment.In 2023, La Liga told CNN Sport that it cannot impose punishments on clubs or fans itself. Instead, it must report incidents to RFEF committees or regional prosecutors who then deal with them as legal cases before sporting punishments are handed out.World soccer’s governing body FIFA reiterated its stance on fighting racism to CNN Sport, and said the issue will be an agenda point at the FIFA Congress in May.“The 74th FIFA Congress will mark a milestone in FIFA’s ongoing efforts to fight racism with new and stricter measures to be applied worldwide in cooperation with all our member associations and the confederations,” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said in a statement.European soccer’s governing body UEFA told CNN Sport that it has continued to publicly denounce racism and has launched multiple campaigns to try tackle the issue.<h2>Real Madrid superstar</h2>Bellingham has flourished since joining Real Madrid from German side Borussia Dortmund at the start of the season, settling in much more quickly than many had expected.The pressure of playing for arguably the most famous team in world soccer has seemingly motivated the youngster to elevate his game and he’s now considered one of the best players in the world.“I would say that Madrid feels like home now. I feel like I have a familiar kind of connection with the fans and the people. So, yeah, really happy,” he said.The midfielder recently scored the last-minute winner in Madrid’s controversial El Clásico victory on Sunday – the latest in a long-run of game changing moments which has underpinned his time at the Spanish giant.There is still a chance that Bellingham can win both the league title and Champions League trophy in his debut season at the club, testament to his impact on the side.Away from his club, Bellingham will also be a pivotal figure for England at the upcoming European Championships later this year.Gareth Southgate’s side is one of the favorites to lift the title, and Bellingham is determined to go one better than England did when finishing runners-up at Euro 2020.“Very confident. You know, a lot of the lads are on top form and we have a lot of talent and a great mix of experience and youth,” he said.“We’ve got to take the confidence from the last tournaments into this one and hopefully go one better.”",2024-04-24 14:14:00 PM EEST,CNN,Jude Bellingham wants ‘more extreme consequences’ for fans who racially abuse players,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/24/sport/jude-bellingham-racist-abuse-laureus-spt-intl/index.html
David Close,"A spokesperson says the NBA is “looking into” an apparent incident involving Denver Nuggets superstar Nikola Jokić’s brother, Strahinja Jokić, which happened after the Nuggets won their home game against the Los Angeles Lakers on Monday night.A video posted on social media overnight Tuesday appears to show Strahinja Jokić wearing his brother’s No. 15 jersey, stepping over a row of seats to confront another fan and then punching him in the head.The Denver Police Department (DPD) says it’s aware of the video and is looking into what happened, noting that the incident at Ball Arena wasn’t reported to police.DPD says “no one has come forward as a victim” but the department “is actively working to identify the person in the video who was struck and encourages anyone who was involved or witnessed this firsthand to contact the Denver Police Department.”CNN has reached out to the Nuggets, Lakers and security at Ball Arena for comment.It is not clear what transpired before the incident.Nikola Jokić, who is in the running to win a third MVP award after another dominating season, scored 27 points, grabbed 20 rebounds, and dished 10 assists against the Lakers on Monday in Game 2 of their first round playoff series.The Nuggets took a 2-0 series lead after Denver’s Jamal Murray hit a game-winning, buzzer-beater to cap a dramatic 101-99 comeback win.",2024-04-24 13:49:00 PM EEST,CNN,NBA and Denver Police ‘looking into’ reported incident involving brother of two-time MVP Nikola Jokić,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/24/sport/nikola-jokic-brother-incident-nba-denver-police-spt-intl/index.html
Chris Isidore,"Boeing reported a slightly smaller loss in the first quarter compared to the same time a year ago, and warned investors and employees it will have to cut back production further to deal with quality and safety issues on its production line.Boeing reported a core operating loss of $388 million, or $1.13 a share, from the $440 million it lost on that basis a year earlier. That was significantly less than analysts’ forecast of $1.63 a share in the quarter. But the improvement came from outside its key commercial airplanes unit, where losses from operations nearly doubled to $1.1 billion.Revenue tumbled $1.4 billion, or 8% to $16.6 billion, as the problems at the airplane maker resulted in a sharp drop in deliveries of jets to its airline customers. The company gets most of its money from sales of commercial planes only upon deliveries to customers.The slightly better than expected financial results don’t make up for a company struggling with questions from Congress, regulators and the traveling public about the quality and safety of its aircraft. It is not only scrambling to repair its badly damaged reputation but also to satisfy airline customers being hurt by not receiving the aircraft they had been promised. Boeing said it is taking the necessary steps to fix the quality issues. But those fixes will continue to cause additional losses and missed delivery targets in the months ahead.Boeing said it would produce fewer 737 Max jets than it originally planned for the rest of this year as it tries to fix problems on its assembly lines. Production of its larger 787 Dreamliner will also be limited by supplier issues, it said.“We will take the time necessary to strengthen our quality and safety management systems, and this work will position us for a stronger and more stable future,” said CEO Dave Calhoun, who announced during the quarter his plans to leave his post by the end of the year.The company said the results were hurt by the compensation to airline customers for the three-week grounding of the 737 Max 9 jets, following a January 5 incident in which a door plug blew off of an Alaska Airlines flight leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane shortly after take-off.Boeing did not disclose the amount of compensation to the airlines in its initial earnings report. Alaska Air and United Airlines, the two carriers with the most 737 Max 9 planes in their fleets, have already announced they had reached compensation agreements with Boeing.Alaska said it received initial cash compensation of $162 million. United did not say how much it agreed to, but said that the grounding cost it about $200 million, and that its compensation would be in the form of credits on future purchases from Boeing.The incident has sparked a series of investigations into Boeing by the National Transportation Safety Board, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Justice Department, the latter of which could expose the company to criminal liability. It also focused attention on the safety and quality of its aircraft, and its way of treating employees who raise concerns about those issues, including congressional hearings.Boeing has said it has made a new commitment to improving its quality and safety issues and that it wants employees with concerns to bring them forward.Shares of Boeing (BA), which had lost 35% so far this year through Tuesday’s close, were up more than 3% in early trading on the smaller-than-forecast loss.Boeing has had a string of losses and problems with its planes’ quality dating back at least five years. Two fatal crashes of the 737 Max in late 2018 and early 2019 that killed 346 people were tied to a design flaw in the plane and led to a 20-month grounding of Boeing’s best-selling model. It had subsequent problems with the quality of jets once the 737 Max was returned to service.All told the company has reported core operating losses of $31.9 billion since the start of the grounding in 2019.But it reported a record month for orders in December, capping what had been one of its best years ever in terms of commercial jet sales. Deliveries also reached a five-year high, and it even reported a rare core operating profit of $90 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. It also announced plans to increase production of the 737 Max throughout 2024 in order to return to sustained profitability.But by the time it reported those better results for 2023, the incident aboard the Alaska Air flight had already occurred, dashing hopes that it was about to put its financial problems behind it.While the NTSB has not determined who specifically is at fault for the accident, a preliminary investigation has found that the jet left a Boeing factory missing the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place.This is a developing story. It will be updated.",2024-04-24 16:42:00 PM EEST,CNN,"Boeing losses, problems continue to mount",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/24/business/boeing-losses/index.html
Laura He,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.TikTok is facing an existential crisis in America. If its Chinese owner fails to sell the app in the next year or so, it could be banned in its biggest market.Not only would that deal another huge blow to China’s tech ambitions, it would further deepen the divide between two digital worlds centered around the rival economic superpowers.Congress on Tuesday approved legislation that could compel ByteDance to sell TikTok or face a national ban. President Joe Biden is expected to sign the bill into law on Wednesday; TikTok has already said it will challenge the law in court.Beijing has previously said it strongly opposes a forced sale of TikTok, and it has revised its export control rules to give it the power to block a sale on national security grounds. That leaves few options for ByteDance to secure the future of TikTok in the US, its biggest market with 170 million users.“A forced sale of TikTok in the US amounts to a downgrade of the app, as the Chinese government won’t approve the sale of its algorithms,” said Alex Capri, a research fellow at the Hinrich Foundation and a lecturer at the National University of Singapore’s Business School.“If TikTok is forced to stop operating in the US, ByteDance’s prospects in other mostly liberal democracies will come under further scrutiny,” he said.If the Chinese government won’t let ByteDance relinquish TikTok’s algorithm, it could block the sale outright. Alternatively, it may allow TikTok to be sold without the lucrative algorithm that forms the basis for its popularity.A US ban, or a less powerful version of TikTok, would be a windfallfor YouTube, Google, Instagram and other TikTok competitors, as many of its customers may jump ship, Capri said. And it would be a major hit to the global ambitions of ByteDance.“It [a TikTok ban] would be the end of ByteDance’s global expansion, as it would be a sign that the Chinese state values the algorithm’s security more than ByteDance’s financial prosperity and global expansion,” said Richard Windsor, tech industry analyst and founder of Radio Free Mobile, a research company based in the US.“The implications are that the ideological struggle being fought in the technology industry will become more intense.”A ban on TikTok is also likely to accelerate a shift that is splitting the world’s tech landscape into two blocs, one centered on the US, the other embracing tech from China, according to Capri.“The move against TikTok in the US is another step towards not only a bifurcated platform economy between Chinese apps and Western apps, but also, more broadly, the bifurcation of entire the global tech landscape,” he said.“This includes everything from who owns and operates data centers, to space-based internet satellites, to undersea cables and, of course semiconductors.”In that sense, the TikTok ban has its silver lining for Beijing.“A ban in the US will spark renewed efforts to spread China’s digital footprint in Southeast Asia, and other mostly developing markets world wide,” Capri said.<h2>Growing challenges for Chinese apps</h2>The TikTok legislation was included in a wide-ranging foreign aid package meant to support Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan.Once President Biden signs it into law, ByteDance will have up to a year to complete the sale or face an effective ban for the platform.US officials and legislators have long expressed concerns about TikTok’s potential national security risks, including that it could share data with the Chinese government, or manipulate content displayed on the platform. But TikTok has rejected the claims.“The new divestiture bill is the result of a concerted lobbying effort by Silicon Valley venture capitalists associated with US technology companies that stand to benefit from the China threat narrative proponents of the bill have been pushing, ” said Paul Triolo, partner for China and Technology Policy Lead at Albright Stonebridge Group.In general, Chinese companies and apps operating the US are facing growing challenges, he said.Biden administration officials are beefing up a new office at the Commerce Department to enforce provisions of a Trump-era rule on protecting US information technology supply chains that covers connected apps and could be used to push for further restrictions.“It seems unlikely that Congress would single out another Chinese company like TikTok for a specific bill, but the Commerce IT supply chain rule could be used in the future to limit the ability of Chinese companies and apps to have access to portions of the US market,” Triolo said.<h2>Will there be retaliation from Beijing?</h2>China’s Commerce Ministry has pledged to take all “necessary measures” to protect its interests, shortly after the House of Representatives passed an earlier version of the TikTok bill last month. But it didn’t elaborate.On Wednesday, Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry said in response to a question from CNN’s Marc Stewart: “On the TikTok matter, we have stated our position clearly, and I have nothing to add today.”Most American social networking apps have already been barred in China. Beijing currently blocks most US social media platforms — including Google, YouTube, X, Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook — because they refuse to follow the Chinese government’s rules on data collection and the type of content shared.Triolo doesn’t expect Beijing to react “strongly” to the US ban on TikTok, though.“While Beijing is already on record as opposing any forced divestiture of TikTok US from Bytedance, its primary concern would be the transfer of technology involved,” he said. “In general, Beijing cares much less about a social media company than about US technology controls.”“Beijing will be much more likely to retaliate strongly to new US export controls, and is not likely to respond in kind to the US effort to ban Tiktok US if it eventually happens,” he added.Beijing recently ordered Apple (AAPL) to remove social messaging apps WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram from the firm’s China app store. But it has not followed up with major crackdowns on virtual private networks, which many tech savvy Chinese use to communicate with friends abroad via these messaging apps.“The move was likely timed to show that China will continue to block access to some apps it considers to be a national security threat, though the blocked apps have far fewer users in China than the 170 million or so users of TikTok in the US,” Triolo said.— CNN’s Wayne Chang and Marc Stewart contributed reporting.",2024-04-24 16:24:00 PM EEST,CNN,Banning TikTok would hit China’s tech ambitions and deepen the global digital divide,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/24/tech/tiktok-ban-bytedance-split-the-world-further-intl-hnk/index.html

David was diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder called severe combined immunodeficiency, and Mario was eventually diagnosed with autism.Throughout her childhood, Meneses Maples’ mom would frequently stay at the hospital with David, while her dad took care of Mario when he wasn’t at work. Her parents didn’t have much time to care for Meneses Maples, who said she often felt like she was invisible.In many families, parents or guardians can be so consumed with caring for a special needs child that their other children often respond by trying to reduce their own needs. The children without special needs can feel like they are “see-through,” as though they are made of glass, Meneses Maples said to CNN recently.Meneses Maples refers to herself as an adult “glass child,” the sibling of a person with a mental or physical disability. She didn’t coin the phrase, but a TEDx talk she gave in 2011 helped to define it, and the term has circulated on social media ever since.“We’re very sensitive to the needs of our parents and our siblings. And we love our mothers and fathers and our brothers and sisters. And we know that the problems that we have, the things that we face, are insignificant compared to what our parents are dealing with, and our siblings are dealing with,” Meneses Maples told a San Antonio TEDx audience 13 years ago. “So, we’re very quiet.”Not much research has been done on the effects of growing up with a sibling who has special needs, according to Debbie Missud, a New York City licensed mental health counselor and psychotherapist and self-described former glass child. But television series such as HBO’s “Euphoria” and Hulu’s “Suncoast” have depicted these sibling relationships.And now people like Meneses Maples are sharing their stories to help families in similar situations and to bring awareness to children who may feel unseen but don’t have the words to express it.Often not due to any fault of their families, glass children can have their wants and needs put on a backburner as their parents tend to the sibling with greater needs, said Emily Holl, director of the Sibling Support Project, a national program that specializes in helping the siblings of people with special health needs.Many glass children tend to set higher standards for themselves so as not to burden their already busy parents, Missud said. These feelings in childhood can lead to a desire to overachieve and be hyper-independent in adulthood, she added.Both types of siblings can develop a sense of guilt about the family situation that is out of their control. “The child or the person with a disability will say, ‘I feel guilty that I just sucked up so much time and attention in our family,’” Holl said. “And then the sibling who doesn’t have a disability will say, ‘I always felt guilty because you have this disability that presents some daily challenges, and also in the context of a world that isn’t very accepting of difference to begin with.’”It is important for adults to recognize that both sets of children have needs that should be met, Holl added.Meneses Maples loved her two younger brothers. Her brother David couldn’t play outside due to a weakened immune system, but she remembers playing with his toy trucks as they sat in front of the television. She would go swimming with her brother Mario at a neighbor’s pool but would get embarrassed when he often used the pool as a bathroom, she said.Meneses Maples had to help with her brothers. She ensured Mario didn’t unlock the car door and jump out. At home, she would try to stop him from putting holes in the wall or breaking things. “There wasn’t anything I owned that he did not somehow break,” she said.She knew what to do if her brother David had a seizure or if his heart monitor went off when her parents weren’t around. She shared a room with her brothers, and at night, she knew to call her parents when David threw up.As Meneses Maples told the TEDx audience of her childhood, some audience members laughed at the relatability, and sniffles could be heard during other parts. One audience member later said she felt as if the presentation was meant for her.As she listened to Meneses Maples’ story, Shelley Cook, an adult glass child herself, began to feel a mix of emotions, she said recently — sad, angry and robbed of a childhood she never had.On the day Cook was born in 1979, her 2-year-old sister, Andrea, was diagnosed with leukemia. The treatment that saved Andrea’s life would leave her intellectually stunted, according to Cook.Andrea loved Disney Princesses, coloring with her little sister and brother, and would often repeat her phrases to have the last word. The sisters would play together, and they would fight, as sisters do.“My sister would put me in my place quite a bit,” Cook recalled. While her parents both had work to do, Cook would bring Andrea to outings with her friends after school and give her the most “normal” experience that she could, she said.As a teenager, Cook said it was hard to accept when her sister would do things that weren’t age-appropriate. Often, a trip to the store would end in her sister having a fit because she couldn’t get something she wanted. At school, Cook said she felt responsible for helping her sister and for protecting her from unkind remarks from their peers.Andrea passed away in March 2020 at age 42 due to colorectal cancer. Cook didn’t have kids of her own, always planning on taking care of her sister when their parents died, she said.“I had this fantasy of an older sister who would teach me everything I needed to know, and who would kind of protect me,” Cook said. “I wanted her to have a full life. But it seemed like the world was not built for her to have a full life.”As Cook sat in the audience of the TEDx presentation, she thought of her own childhood. When the program was over, she met Meneses Maples outside. “Now I know why I am the way I am,” she recalled telling Meneses Maples.Dr. Al Freedman met Meneses Maples in November, when she spoke to a group of people ages 25 to 66 whose siblings had fibromyalgia. Freedman, a licensed psychologist, had a son, Jack, who died in 2021 at 26 from the rare disease spinal muscular atrophy. Freedman also has a healthy daughter, Cara, who is 24.With their age difference of almost five years, Cara learned how to walk via the help of Jack’s wheelchair. Jack didn’t have the strength and abilities to play in certain ways, but Cara enjoyed sitting with him for a computer game in which he used his eye movement to control the mouse, Freedman said.Jack’s medical needs required innumerable hospital visits and in-home nurses. Sometimes, friends and neighbors would step in to bring Cara to tennis practice or choir concerts. “Cara’s life was disrupted often,” Freedman said, “and she wasn’t attended to in ways that Mom and Dad would have chosen because we had to have our eyes on Jack every second.”Careful not to put his daughter in any caretaker roles, Freedman said, he knew she liked to help Jack when she could, often assisting a nurse or her parents in getting her brother ready for bed. At 7 or 8, she started to volunteer with her dad at conferences for Cure SMA, an organization that helps families of spinal muscular atrophy.“When a family like mine goes anywhere, everybody notices that child in the wheelchair, but not everybody pays the same amount of attention to the child that is next to the child in a wheelchair,” Freedman said. He described his daughter and other glass children as flexible, independent and compassionate due to their childhoods.Freedman specializes in counseling the families of a person with a rare disease, with recent work tailored to the experiences of the other siblings, he said. He draws on how he always kept communication open with his daughter and would ask for her patience while he had to tend to Jack, he said.It is important not to assume what the needs of a glass child are, said Missud, the New York psychotherapist. “Ask them, open a dialog and have that conversation,” she said. Missud also recommends giving the child more agency by providing opportunities to make decisions around the house, such as what to eat for dinner or what film to watch on movie night.Parents need to know that kids are always watching, Freedman said, and will likely try to refrain adding to their parents’ full plates with their own problems. “Your parents may have come up short at times; I came up short at times,” he said. “But everybody was doing their best under difficult conditions.”Meneses Maples’ brother David was 5 when he died. Meneses Maples, then 11, started to have thoughts of suicide, she said. But when adults asked if she were OK, she would tell them she was fine, she recalled.“Well-meaning adults would see me when I was 6 or 7, and they’d say to me, ‘Alicia, you need to be a good girl for Mommy and Daddy. They’re taking care of Mario; they’re taking care of David. So, you do whatever you can to make Mommy and Daddy happy,’” Meneses Maples said during her TEDx talk.“If I could travel back in time, and visit young Alicia, in those moments, I would whisper in her ear, ‘Tell them that’s not your job,’” she said recently.More than a decade after her TEDx presentation, Meneses Maples receives messages from parents of glass children seeking her advice. Meneses Maples said she hopes to inspire research on glass children by spreading the word through presentations and workshops.“I thought perhaps by sharing my story with many people, many children’s lives will be forever changed — many glass children’s lives,” Meneses Maples said. “This is my passion. … It’s very emotional. It’s taxing, but it’s what I’m supposed to be doing.”",2024-04-23 20:04:00 PM EEST,CNN,What it’s like to be a ‘glass child’,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/23/health/glass-children-invisible-sibling-wellness/index.html
Sandee LaMotte,"Sign up for CNN’s Stress, But Less newsletter. Our six-part mindfulness guide will inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it.Despite working a full-time job in human relations and caring for her 6-year-old son Chase and 3-year-old daughter Millie, Anne Helmes often feels isolated and lonely.“I work from home, and when I have video meetings or calls with our employees, it’s very focused on the subject at hand. I don’t get a lot of personal interaction such as ‘How are you? How’s your family doing?’” said 36-year-old Helmes, who lives in Powell, Ohio.“There’s obvious benefits to working from home — it allows me to avoid a commute that eats into my time with my children and husband in the evening,” she said. “But there are some days when my most personal conversation is with my dog.”Many parents today find parenting a challenge to their ability to connect with other adults, according to a new national survey published Wednesday by the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus.In fact, 66% of 1,005 surveyed parents felt the demands of parenthood sometimes or frequently left them feeling isolated and lonely, while nearly 40% felt as if they have no one to support them in their parenting role.“I’m a mom of four,” said Kate Gawlik, an associate clinical professor at the Ohio State University College of Nursing in Columbus who conducted the research.“My life is incredibly busy,” she said.”Keeping busy, however, does not replace the need for friendship and more intimate conversations with others who share your interests.”About 62% of the participants in the survey felt burned out by their responsibilities as a parent. That makes sense because isolation and loneliness go hand in hand with burnout, said Kacey Cardwell, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Atlanta and clinical fellow for the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy.“When parents are feeling lonely and isolated, that tells me their adult needs aren’t being met because they’re pouring what they can into their child. That’s a recipe for burnout,” said Cardwell, who was not involved in the research.By definition, burnout is an overwhelming feeling of exhaustion, Gawlik said.“Burnout is not new for parents, but I think the pandemic took it to a totally different level,” she added. “We were expected to be these super humans that were working and homeschooling their kids without a break.”Helmes was pregnant with her daughter when the pandemic hit. It wasn’t long before her husband was furloughed by his job and they lost day care for her son.“We had to be frugal,” she said. “And because I was pregnant during the pandemic, I had to be very cautious about my exposure and was quite limited in my interactions with others.”Like many other parents, Helmes worked in an office before the pandemic and was used to the social interaction that often came with the territory.“I would see people in a break room, walking down the hall, in-between meetings, after meetings, and just snag them and start talking about what’s happening in our lives,” she said.Even that didn’t overcome the isolation that parenting can sometimes bring, Helmes said, especially when her children are going through age-appropriate challenges that baffled her and her husband.“My husband is amazing, but I really needed to hear from another mom,” she said. “My best friend’s children were much older, and I didn’t know anyone with children the same age as mine.“It’s easy to feel alone as if you’re facing something all by yourself.”Nearly 4 in 5 parents would value a way to connect with other parents outside of work and home, according to the survey. Even then, however, many parents may not want to admit to their feelings of isolation and loneliness for fear of sounding like they do not care about their children.Don’t think that way, Gawlik stressed.“We’ve all had the experience of being in a room full of people but not connecting with any of them and feeling alone, right?” she said. “It’s the same with parenting. You definitely are connecting with your children, but it’s a parent-child connection, not a friend to friend, family to family or spouse to spouse connection.”Networking with other parents is a priority for parents who feel isolated and burned out, Cardwell said.“I always suggest looking for connections in your immediate community, with people who live close to you,” she said. “You might find a walking companion, craft companions, carpooling and babysitting help just in your own neighborhood.“After that, you can try community organizations, parent organizations, school associations, churches or synagogues,” she added.Social media groups are not enough, Cardwell said.“It’s one-dimensional social engagement,” she said. “That doesn’t take the place of talking to a person one on one, such as when you’re with a group of mothers, say with babies and toddlers who are all at a similar age. All the children are experiencing similar things and moms can share and get support.”Helmes joined a positive parenting group run by Gawlik and credits that with giving her renewed energy as a parent.“It made me feel much less lonely,” she said. “When a parent shared, I would nod my head like ‘Yup, same here, been through that’ or ‘Yes, I’m going through that at this moment.’ And it was just so validating.”",2024-04-24 16:15:00 PM EEST,CNN,Parents are feeling lonely.

Meg Tirrell,"Kerry Pearl remembers the pharmacist holding up the medicine her 4-year-old son needed to help him breathe.“He was literally holding it, looking at me like: ‘I can’t give you this,’ ” she recalls. “My poor kid is at home not sleeping through the night and waking up coughing, and you’re holding the answer and the insurance company kind of holds the keys here.”It was the asthma drug fluticasone, whose brand name is Flovent. It’s used daily by the youngest children with asthma as a preventive medicine so their airways don’t get so swollen that a trigger — a virus, cold air, pollen — could cause an asthma attack.As a toddler, before Pearl’s son started it, she said he would cough all night and sometimes gasp for breath when he talked. With the medicine, she said, his asthma was finally under control.But the maker of Flovent, British drug giant GSK, removed the branded drug from the US market in January, and its replacement — an authorized generic form identical in all but branding — doesn’t have the same insurance coverage. It costs hundreds of dollars a month without it. The move has left families like Pearl’s scrambling.Asthma drugs can be pricy across the board, so much so that the Senate health committee, led by Sen. Bernie Sanders, opened an investigation into the situation in January.Shortly afterward, three of the biggest makers of asthma inhalers, including GSK, pledged to cap out-of-pocket costs for some US patients at $35.The problem, doctors and parents told CNN, is those pledges don’t apply to daily inhalers used by the youngest kids with asthma.“While the progress that’s been made with the out-of-pocket caps is great, and has left a lot of us in general feeling optimistic, children still can’t get their hands on a preventive asthma inhaler,” said Dr. Robyn Cohen, a pediatric pulmonologist at Boston Medical Center.It’s a situation that has put kids in danger of asthma flare-ups and visits to the ER.<h2>Asthma drugs for the littlest kids</h2>There are three inhalers in this category that the youngest kids with asthma can use, Cohen explained. They’re called metered-dose inhalers, and they’re paired with a device called a spacer — essentially a face mask that connects to the dispenser. That enables the medicine to be given as an aerosol so little kids can just breathe it in.“A child just needs to breathe through the face mask and we know that they’re getting the medication,” Cohen said. Other devices in the category, she explained, “require the patient to initiate a strong deep breath in, and then they have to hold their breath for 10 seconds.”That’s not something toddlers and young children can be taught to do.Since GSK took branded Flovent off the market earlier this year, the three options left have become increasingly expensive and hard to find.The authorized generic version of Flovent, fluticasone, is sold by a different company, Prasco Laboratories. So GSK’s pledge to cap monthly out-of-pocket costs at $35 across all of its asthma and COPD products doesn’t apply to generic fluticasone.But the generic isn’t covered as widely by insurers as branded Flovent was, likely because it doesn’t come with rebates paid by the manufacturer to lower its net cost. Pharmacy benefit managers, which make decisions about how drugs will be covered by insurance, told CNN the authorized generic was more expensive than the branded version.Doctors like Cohen and Christy Sadreameli, a pediatric pulmonologist at Johns Hopkins, saw this coming last year. One solution was to try to switch kids to another option, Asmanex, but that drug has now gone into shortage as a result.“It was much worse than we expected,” Sadreameli told CNN. “I have very few tools for this population.”The third inhaler in this category is called Alvesco, and it also doesn’t have broad insurance coverage, Cohen said — perhaps because it carries a higher list price. Sadreameli cited data showing it costs more than $300 a month before insurance coverage; Asmanex is less than half that.“All of us know of know of a child who has struggled as a result of this,” Cohen said.<h2>Going without needed medication</h2>Julie Leach’s 13-year-old daughter, Abby, has a very rare condition called cerebrocostomandibular syndrome that restricted her lung development, and she was doing well on Flovent until it was discontinued.And the insurance tangles for these medications can lead families through bureaucratic odysseys to get the inhalers their kids need — a process they have to go through every month.Her insurance suggested Abby use a drug called Pulmicort instead of the generic Flovent. Abby’s doctor, Sadreameli, said Abby should stick with the metered dose inhalers that can be used with spacers, since Abby has a tracheostomy tube in her airway. Sadreameli and her team spent time working with Leach’s insurance provider to agree on a solution, and they settled on Alvesco.“Then insurance came back and denied it, and I was like, ‘No, no – you just approved this,’ ” Leach told CNN.It ended up taking a month to work out, while Abby didn’t have any medication. When insurance finally did approve the drug, a patient assistance coupon was applied to it that carried a $65 copay, when Leach’s secondary Medicaid coverage should have come with none.“It took another probably two weeks for me to call around to all these people” to get the coupon removed, Leach said. “Meanwhile, she doesn’t have any inhaler … I’m panicking because she’s never really been without an inhaler ever. So I really didn’t know how her lungs were going to react, not having medicine.”Leach said every month, when she goes to fill the prescription — for just one of more than a dozen medicines Abby needs — she holds her breath.Some insurers do provide coverage options; OptumRx, one of the major PBMs, told CNN it allows children 5 and under to get the authorized generic Flovent without prior authorization review, an extra step required for certain medicines. It said for other patients who need it, “their care provider only needs to indicate that a spacer is required.”CVS Caremark, another large PBM, said patients age 6 and under are able to receive the drug without submitting a formulary exception, and for older patients, “reasonable exceptions will continue to be available based on patient-specific clinical rationale.”Yet it is not always clear which PBM a patient has when a doctor is prescribing a medicine, Sadreameli said, and they frequently encounter hurdles – including having to spend hours on phone calls or filling out paperwork to obtain coverage. And, said Cohen, out-of-pocket costs can still be high even with coverage.Alvesco and Asmanex are made by Covis Pharma and Organon, which are not among the companies that made the $35 pledges on asthma and COPD drugs. Aside from GSK, the other two manufacturers that did are Boehringer Ingelheim and AstraZeneca.Organon told CNN it’s “working tirelessly to increase supply” of Asmanex, and said it already offers a savings coupon for privately insured patients to enable them to pay “as little as $15” for each prescription.Covis and Prasco, the maker of the authorized generic fluticasone, didn’t immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment on whether they planned to implement price caps.For parents like Leach and Pearl, the lack of help for kids is incredibly frustrating.“I don’t know why we’re treating kids as kind of like a lesser population,” Pearl said. “Kids need to breathe just like adults do.”",2024-04-17 23:21:00 PM EEST,CNN,"‘Kids need to breathe just like adults do’: $35 price caps don’t apply to asthma meds young children need, doctors say",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/17/health/asthma-inhaler-kids-price-cap/index.html
Jen Christensen,"When Jessica Coletti’s 3-year-old son Vincent lost his usual pep last month, she worried that something was really wrong.“Mommy, I’m not good,” the normally energetic boy told his mother one Saturday in early March. By Monday, the Chicago mom of two said Vincent was no longer moving much or talking.“His eyes looked super empty,” Coletti said﻿, describing her son’s eyes, glassy from fever. Vincent’s eyes were also red and he had a rash. He’d tested positive for Covid-19 at the time, but Coletti felt like something else seemed off.The family’s neighbor, a nurse, came over to check on  the boy and urged Coletti to get him to a hospital right away.“It was definitely one of the scarier moments of my life,” Coletti said.A couple of days after the 3-year-old’s hospital visit, the test results came back positive for a highly infectious disease that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had considered officially “eliminated” from the US since 2000.Vincent had measles.Coletti lives in one of the 17 states that have reported outbreaks of measles this year.As of April 18, there have been 125 cases, according to the CDC. Last year there were only 58 cases. The US generally sees about 72 cases per year, according to the CDC.Most measles cases in the US happen when someone travels overseas to a country where the virus hasn’t been eliminated, but Coletti’s son hadn’t been out of the country. He wasn’t even enrolled in school yet. Most of the cases in Chicago this year have been connected to a temporary shelter set up for migrants, but he hadn’t been there either.Coletti may never know how Vincent caught it, doctors say.“Measles is so terribly contagious. You could be in line at a grocery store with somebody who had measles and catch it and would never know, because the measles virus hangs out in the air for so long,” said Dr. Claudia Hoyen, the director of pediatric infection control at UH Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital in Cleveland. Hoyen did not treat Coletti’s son.Coletti said her son had been partially vaccinated, but he hadn’t had his second shot yet because he was too young.In the US, the CDC recommends that children get the first dose of the vaccine that protects against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) between 12 and 15 months of age. Kids get a second shot between 4 and 6 years of age.The vaccine for measles is considered highly effective. One dose is 93% effective against measles, with two it is 97%. Vaccinated people can still get sick, but it doesn’t happen often and typically it’s a milder infection.“Little kids with the measles just look miserable. They do not feel well at all,” Hoyen said. But, she said, Coletti’s son was fortunate to have protection from even a single dose of the vaccine. Measles can be deadly for people who are unvaccinated and lead to even bigger health problems including encephalitis and pneumonia.“Especially if he had Covid and measles at the same time. I would be worried that he might be someone who would be set up to get pneumonia, because he already had something affecting his respiratory tract, so it is a good thing he was vaccinated,” Hoyen said.Coletti said they had a long wait before they were seen at a local hospital, but Vincent was admitted as doctors ran tests and treated him with IV fluids. A day later, the boy started feeling better and his rash seemed to go away, Coletti said, and Vincent was sent him home.But that was not the end of it. The phone rang two days later and Coletti learned about his measles diagnosis.It wasn’t just a sick kid Coletti had on her hands: She was inundated with other calls related to the virus.Coletti said the Chicago Department of Public Heath called first, followed by her son’s doctor’s office. And then she got another call from the hospital where her son had been admitted.“It was a doctor letting me know that my son was exposed to measles in the ER and I was like ‘no, my son is the one who exposed your ER,’ ” Coletti said.Although her son started to feel better by the end of the week, the CDC recommends that people who are sick remain in isolation for four days after the onset of the rash because the virus is so contagious. People with measles can infect others from four days prior to the rash and four days after, studies show. The virus can stay in the air for at least two hours after someone with the measles leaves the area.Because Coletti’s infant daughter was too young to be vaccinated, Coletti worried she would test positive for the virus, so the whole family had to stay at home. The health department also told her that she and her husband had to stay home from work until they could prove they weren’t sick and had been vaccinated.“The nightmare wasn’t just that my son was sick. That was horrible, but then it’s your whole world. You can’t go to work. You can’t do this and that, and you can’t even believe it,” Coletti said. “You never think it is going to happen to you, but until you are dealing with all those phone calls trying to figure out what’s going on and tracking the last 21 days of your life so they could try to link you to someone else that has it. It’s more than what you think. People don’t realize how much goes into it.”Any time someone tests positive for measles, public health departments try and contact trace anyone who may have come into contact with that person to help stop the spread.Blood tests eventually showed Coletti and her husband had protection from vaccination.Dr. Frank Belmonte, the chief medical officer and chairman of Pediatrics at Advocate Children’s Hospital in the Chicago area said that with the recent outbreak of measles in the city, hospital staff has been doing a lot of mitigation efforts. The city has seen 63 cases so far this year.Belmonte said Advocate Children’s Hospital tries to be proactive. Workers go through patient records to see who is behind on their vaccines and call people to encourage them to get up to date. They’ve also done education and outreach efforts about measles in the community in a variety of languages. And because measles had been so rare, they have also had to train staff to recognize the symptoms.“We’ve also done a lot of education with our physician community, telling them to be on the lookout for the symptoms and to understand what the rash looks like,” Belmonte said. “A lot of this generation of physicians either only saw it very rarely or never saw a case of measles.”When his hospital has a case, Belmonte said they call anyone who may have been exposed, as well as figure out a plan for those who could get sick.“We’ve learned a lot during Covid about how to do this and how to work well with our state and local public health authorities and I think we’ve used those techniques and applied it to this particular situation with measles as well,” Belmonte said.Hoyen, with UH Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital, said health care systems need to have a heightened sense of awareness when there are measles cases in the community. For example, even when Cleveland didn’t have a single case of measles last summer, hospital staff knew to ask patients if they had traveled to Columbus, Ohio, when that city had an outbreak.“Kind of like what we were doing with Covid, to help screen people out — again, because measles is so terribly contagious,” Hoyen said.Hoyen has been concerned about the trend in lower vaccination rates among kindergartners in the US, but she hopes recent education efforts will help people understand why they should get protection.“Whatever we can do to get people to understand that it’s not just a rash, it can be pneumonia or it can be encephalitis and you can die,” Hoyen said. “You don’t want to put kids at risk for this.”Coletti saw what a “mild” case looked like with her partially vaccinated child and said she wouldn’t wish that on anyone.“It was a lot at once,” Coletti said.",2024-04-22 15:23:00 PM EEST,CNN,Mother of Chicago child with measles: It was ‘one of the scarier moments of my life’,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/22/health/measles-child-infection/index.html
Marianne Garvey,"Drew Carey picked up a really big tab last year and doesn’t regret it.The actor and host of “The Price is Right” covered meals for members of the Writers Guild of America at Bob’s Big Boy and Swingers in Los Angeles during their 148-day strike last summer and fall.Carey appeared at the WGA Awards ceremony on Sunday night, where he joked about the bill they rang up.“Honestly, I didn’t know it was going to cost me so much money,” Carey said on stage. “The last time, I think the total bill (during a 2007 strike) was like $67,000, fifteen years ago. I thought it was going to be about the same thing, but then some of you decided, ‘Oh yeah, I’m going to get a shake and dessert.’”He said his accountant called him up concerned about how long the strike was going on.“When the bills started piling up, my accountant called and was like, ‘Is there any way we can dial this back?’” he said.But Carey kept on paying, he said Sunday, because “it was the right thing to do.”“You writers, well not all of you, ‘The Drew Carey Show’ writers — made me a f***ing million.

"Ramishah Maruf,Samantha Delouya","Columbia University notified students and faculty Wednesday morning that the hybrid model for classes, meant to ensure student safety, will extend to final exams.Provost Angela Olinto said in an email that all final course assessments, including exams, presentations and projects, “must include a remote option for students who have requested support for virtual assessment.” The move was made “in order to address the concerns of our members in an evolving campus environment,” Olinto wrote.The announcement came shortly after the university said it has extended negotiations with student activists over the dismantling of their pro-Palestinian encampment that has highlighted schools’ divestment practices and prompted solidarity protests at colleges across the country.That statement came early Wednesday morning – just hours after Columbia’s president announced it had given protesters a midnight deadline to reach an agreement or the university would consider “alternative options” to clear the encampment. The talks will now be extended another 48 hours after “important progress” was made, the spokesperson said.Protesters have said they won’t disperse until the university agrees to cut ties with Israeli academic institutions and commits to a “complete divestment” of Columbia’s funds from entities connected to Israel, among other demands. But the editor-in-chief of Columbia’s student newspaper told CNN the negotiating parties seem to be struggling to find a middle ground.“There seems to be very little room in terms of where the university wants to meet the students and the students want to meet with the university,” Isabella Ramirez, editor-in-chief of the Columbia Spectator, said Tuesday night. “It doesn’t seem that there’s much room in terms of compromise.”The university’s commencement ceremony is scheduled for Wednesday, May 15. Currently, the student protestors on the West Lawn are camping in a space that is utilized during commencement.Live updates: Protests at Columbia and other schools enter a second weekStudent organizers released a statement shortly after midnight, saying their representatives left the negotiations Tuesday after the university threatened to call in police and the National Guard if protesters “do not acquiesce to their demands.”Columbia did not comment on the claim when CNN asked for a response to the students’ statement.Tensions have escalated at many US universities since the October 7 terror attack on Israel by Hamas, which killed about 1,200 people and took others hostage, and Israel’s subsequent war on Hamas in Gaza, which has since killed tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians, according to the enclave’s health ministry.As the protests stretch into their eighth day, Columbia President Minouche Shafik has faced criticism from donors and lawmakers who believe police should be brought in to clear the encampment and restore order on campus – even as students and faculty condemn the president’s similar decision last week to ask the New York Police Department to clear another student encampment.More than 80 tents packed the lawn prior to the deadline late Tuesday night as hundreds of people buzzed in and around the encampment. The university said student protesters had “committed to dismantling and removing a significant number of tents” and agreed that people not affiliated with the university will leave the encampment.Student activists “have taken steps to make the encampment welcome to all and have prohibited discriminatory or harassing language,” the university said.Days of unrest on campus, as well as gatherings of non-student protesters outside the university’s gates, have led to safety concerns among Jewish students and prompted Columbia to move to mostly hybrid classes on its main campus for the rest of the semester.“I fully support the importance of free speech, respect the right to demonstrate, and recognize that many of the protestors have gathered peacefully,” Shafik said in a release late Tuesday evening. “However, the encampment raises serious safety concerns, disrupts campus life, and has created a tense and at times hostile environment for many members of our community.”Tensions are high, especially as Jewish students, faculty and staff celebrate the Passover holiday. Elected officials from the mayor of New York through President Joe Biden have commented, with leaders of the House of Representatives issuing statements on both sides of the aisle.House Speaker Mike Johnson said he planned to visit Jewish students at Columbia on Wednesday and hold a news conference “regarding the troubling rise of virulent antisemitism on America’s college campuses,” according to his office.<h2>Other schools join in solidarity</h2>Students across the United States have been protesting in support of Palestinians in Gaza and in solidarity with students who were suspended at Columbia this past week.As the national spotlight has fallen on Columbia, similar encampments are growing at other schools, and officials nationwide are grappling with a response to what has become a coast-to-coast disruption.Pro-Palestinian encampments have been set up at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Emerson College, the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Michigan.Arrests have been made at other campuses across the US as well. More than 100 students from Columbia University and Barnard College were arrested last Thursday. Barnard President Lisa Rosenbury confirmed in a statement Monday that students on interim suspension “no longer have access to most Barnard buildings.”More 130 people were arrested at New York University at a pro-Palestinian protest Monday night. NYU said it asked for help from the NYPD after school officials said there were “intimidating chants and several antisemitic incidents” during a protest. That led to scenes of a chaotic confrontation between protesters and police in full riot gear. An NYPD official said the demonstrations weren’t violent overall, except for a few bottles thrown at police officers.Yale University police arrested at least 45 protesters Monday and charged them with criminal trespassing after they refused orders to leave, said police in New Haven, Connecticut, though dozens of protesters remained Tuesday morning.Harvard University has closed Harvard Yard and officials at the university suspended a pro-Palestinian student organization for allegedly violating school policies.And nine people were arrested Tuesday morning at the University of Minnesota’s Twin Cities campus after they formed an encampment that went against school policy.Students, faculty and staff at the University of New Mexico peacefully protested Monday in support of Gaza, the university said in a statement Tuesday.<h2>Protesters zero in on school’s financial investments</h2>Activists at Columbia said they want a “complete divestment” from anything related to Israel, financial transparency into the university’s investments and amnesty from any disciplinary measures for students participating in the protests.University officials warned earlier Tuesday that the encampment is violating school rules but did not provide specific disciplinary consequences. New York City Mayor Eric Adams said Tuesday authorities have identified “outside agitators” causing problems at the mostly peaceful student protests at Columbia, NYU and other schools in the city.The encampment at Columbia University was lively early this week, with many students congregating in circles, eating and talking.A group of Jewish and non-Jewish students gathered at the encampment to celebrate Passover Seder Monday night. Columbia student Cameron Jones told CNN: “I am Jewish and, to me, Passover symbolizes perseverance and resilience. I think this encampment represents those two ideals because we have seen the university take countless measures to try to suppress our student activism, and here is us persevering through that.”But some other Jewish students say they fear for their safety. Jacob Schmeltz, a senior at Columbia, told CNN he typically celebrated Passover on campus, but has chosen to go home for the holiday this year.“Jewish students have had enough, and it’s gotten to the point that we feel safer off campus than on it,” he said.<h2>In the national spotlight</h2>As the protests stretch on, they have increasingly caught the attention of lawmakers. On Tuesday, the White House said that Biden was “of course aware” of the pro-Palestinian protests at college campuses across the country.“We know that this is a painful moment for many communities, we respect that, and we support every American’s right to peacefully protest, that’s something that we have been consistent about,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates told reporters.Bates also reiterated that the White House denounced calls for violence and antisemitic rhetoric.Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated which day Columbia University announced it has extended negotiations with student activists.

Jason Morris,"Concerts by Phish, the beloved Vermont jam band, have become known among fans as unique, once-in-a-lifetime events filled with striking visuals and spontaneous sonic explorations.Over the decades the band has performed more than 2,000 shows and are famous for never repeating setlists — drawing deeply from their extensive canon of more than 300 original songs plus countless covers.That hasn’t changed. But now, 41 years into their journey, the band has conceived yet another new way to experience their music live: four concerts at Sphere, the $2.3 billion venue in Las Vegas that was christened last fall with a series of shows by U2. The Phish shows kicked off Thursday and run through Sunday night.“It’s a paradigm shift in live music and visual (presentation),” Trey Anastasio, Phish’s bandleader and creative force, told CNN in an interview last week about the Sphere dates. “It’s … an exciting new canvas.”Phish is just the second band to play Sphere, after U2. The state-of-the-art, spherical venue is dominated by a giant LED screen some 250 feet high that wraps above and around the audience. That vast screen, along with 167,000 speakers that ensure pristine sound, make for an immersive concertgoing experience.But while U2 played mostly the same set list and paired songs with pre-made videos that repeated each night, Phish is taking their usual freewheeling approach.The band is not repeating any songs over their four-night run, and each show’s visuals are different and even improvised in the moment, similar to what fans have become accustomed to from Phish’s long-time lighting designer, Chris “CK5” Kuroda.“All of our visuals can be executed, modified, and manipulated in real time,” the band’s creative director for the shows at Sphere, Abigail Rosen Holmes, told CNN. “They will follow the band’s musical performance, rather than being locked in, allowing Phish to play as freely as they would at any other show.”Sure enough, on Thursday’s opening night the psychedelic animations and graphics appeared to soar and glide to the music, creating 3D effects on Sphere’s huge screen. Each song featured distinct visual eye candy, from layered abstract tapestries to breathtaking scenic imagery — both earthly and otherworldly.Daniel Jean of Moment Factory, the Montreal-based multimedia studio that produced and co-directed the visuals, told CNN that working on Sphere’s immersive’s screen “has opened the door to creativity in ways we haven’t been able to explore before. The emotions of the music, mixed cohesively with the visuals on the screen, create an emphatic moment only truly felt by those in the venue.”Members of Phish say they studied U2’s 40-concert Sphere residency to prepare for playing the venue. Phish’s audio engineer even re-created a miniature version of Sphere’s production setup at a practice studio in Pennsylvania last summer so the band could fine-tune the shows’ look and sound.Last week, Anastasio said it would be a challenge to use Sphere’s massive space in a way that still felt organic.“When you see a large-scale production — you know, Beyoncé or U2 or anything that’s really a big, major pop act — the production and the music are on a click. So it makes it easier to have everything happen at the proper time,” he said. “And we don’t do that.”But after Thursday night’s show he sounded pleased with the venue, saying he felt “an intimacy” at Sphere despite its cavernous size.“I could see the audience so clearly, which has such a huge effect on the music. When I can look directly at people dancing, I play so much better. I can react to their energy. I did not expect that,” he told CNN via email. “It’s a huge blessing. It felt very comfortable.”<h2>From the start Phish cultivated a profound bond with its audience</h2>Phish’s signature sound centers around progressive rock arrangements infused with a variety of musical genres, including jazz, funk and blues and beyond.The band formed in 1983 while its members were attending college in Vermont, where Anastasio met drummer Jon Fishman and bassist Mike Gordon. Keyboardist Page McConnell joined the group about two years later.“We started out as a group of friends, in a room with our friends,” Anastasio said. “We would play until 1:30 in the morning, and then we would all go out to Howard Johnson’s for eggs and French toast.  Literally, like the band and the audience. And in some respects, that never changed. It still feels like that.”In their infancy the band started playing residencies at Nectars, then a Burlington restaurant and bar with a small stage in the corner. From the beginning they practiced their complex arrangements religiously, often following Anastasio’s daily schedule detailing which times they would flesh out specific sections of each tune.Gradually Phish built a fan base, mostly through relentless touring across the US.“We built up this following just by playing,” Gordon says in “Bittersweet Motel,” director Todd Phillips’ 2000 documentary about the band. “It was never really records or radio or videos or anything like that that boosted our career. It was all this word-of-mouth thing.”The fans come to shows “because they don’t know what’s going to happen,” Gordon added, “just like we don’t know what’s going to happen” — a sentiment that both band members and fans say hasn’t changed.“We were never really in the public eye,” Anastasio told CNN last week.  “We don’t have hits, or go the Grammys, or anything like that. It’s a community, is what it is. And it really, truly is. And it still feels that way. I think that’s pretty much a big part of what makes us different.”Anastasio says he can feel the “energy” from the crowd during each show, and that informs his decisions on what the band plays in real time — an approach Phish has taken its entire existence.“It has a mind of its own. Everything’s fair game,” Anastasio said. “It’s like a combination of discipline and complete abandon. I don’t think you can have one without the other.”<h2>The band’s concerts have included covers of other groups’ classic albums — and donuts</h2>Anastasio says he enjoys spearheading the complicated logistics required to pull off their elaborate productions. His focus is making sure his bandmates stay in the moment on stage.“If Mike Gordon is totally not thinking, he plays the sickest bass of anybody who has ever lived,” he said. “As soon as you get him thinking, he’s not playing well anymore.”Anastasio says his most exhilarating live moments are when the band goes “completely off the map” into uncharted musical territory.“And there are many of them … where I don’t know where the downbeat is, and I don’t know what key we’re in anymore. And my head is exploding about what Mike is playing or what Fish is playing or what Page is playing,” he said. “And … it feels like being in a tiny, tiny rowboat in the middle of a storm in the ocean.”The band has played more concerts at New York’s fabled Madison Square Garden than any act except Billy Joel. On New Year’s Eve in 2022, Phish turned the arena into a giant undersea visual spectacle, complete with flying dolphins. A year later they created an almost fully realized Broadway show at MSG from their beloved “Gamehendge” suite, a fantasy rock opera last played in its entirety in 1994.“People will ask us … a normal band would build something like that and then take it on tour for four years. Why do you just do these things once?” Anastasio said. “And my response would be that most of the people in the room have been seeing us for so long, we feel like we owe them a new, fresh experience.”The band also has become well known for staging elaborate events. For Halloween, they sometimes adopt “musical costumes” and perform other artists’ classic albums, a tradition they started in 1994 with a surprise cover of the Beatles’ White Album in its entirety.On New Year’s Eve 1999 they hosted The Big Cypress festival in the Florida Everglades, where they played from midnight to sunrise before tens of thousands of fans to usher in the new millennium.And in 2017 they famously played a string of themed shows over 13 nights at Madison Square Garden — an event nicknamed the “Baker’s Dozen” — which included a different donut served to the audience each night.In an era of tightly scripted concerts, this playful, unpredictable approach has endeared them to fans.“Every single show is different, and they keep challenging themselves to be better,” said longtime Phish fan Andy Bernstein, who authored the first edition of The Pharmer’s Almanac, an encyclopedia that compiles the band’s history and statistics.“They built an incredible bond with fans by super serving their audience,” said Ari Fink, senior director of music programming at SiriusXM Radio, where he worked with the band to create a Phish radio channel.Fink says he understands the band’s non-traditional music may not be accessible to casual listeners.“I can totally understand the barrier of entry that some music fans might experience when they give Phish a shot, but the playfulness and the commitment to their craft are the two benchmarks they bring to the table,” he told CNN.<h2>The band’s members have been through a lot together</h2>After their sold-out shows at Sphere, where top seats are commanding more than $2,000 on the secondary market, the quartet plans to go back on the road for another summer tour this July. The same month they also plan to release “Evolve,” their 16th studio album.In August Phish are scheduled to host the Mondegreen festival in Delaware, their 11th self-produced large festival, a tradition the band started in 1996 by taking over a decommissioned Air Force Base in upstate New York.No band endures for four decades without some turbulence, and Phish is no different. Anastasio battled drug and alcohol abuse before getting clean in the mid-2000s. The band took several hiatuses, and its future once was unclear.But the four musicians have persevered, and they say their brotherhood has deepened over the years. Anastasio says his level of awe for his bandmates has grown consistently since they met as teenagers, and they all feel immense gratitude that they still get to create magic together onstage.“The amount of material and the amount of shared history is just incomprehensible at this point in time. I’m trying to find some wood to knock on, but it doesn’t seem to be slowing down at all,” he said.“Walking on stage has become consistently more emotional as the years have gone by, like we look at each other before we go on,” he said. “I can’t believe I have another chance to play with these guys, wherever we are.”",2024-04-23 15:05:00 PM EEST,CNN,How Phish is reimagining Las Vegas’ Sphere,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/20/entertainment/phish-concerts-sphere-anastasio-cec/index.html

As part of the effort, students recreated movie scenes and choreographed videos in hopes of catching the actor’s attention so that he’d appear at the school’s final prom.Payson High School is set to relocate at the end of the school year.“When I first heard about this Bacon to Payson thing, I was like, ‘Wow, this is crazy.’ But you were all just tireless,” Bacon said in his speech on the school’s football field on Saturday, according to ABC7. “You talked me into it.”Bacon said he appreciated the student’s commitment.As part of Payson High School’s effort to get Bacon back on campus, they pledged to create 5,000 essential resource kits to help his Sixdegrees.org foundation, which benefits underserved and under-resourced communities. The organization has a goal of packing and distributing up to 40,000 kits as part of its “Footloose40” initiative.In his speech on Saturday, Bacon thanked the students for “turning what could be just a movie star coming back to get a pat on the back into something really positive.”Bacon was awarded with an honorary Payson High School diploma, posed for photos with students and even swung by his locker during his visit, according to a video posted to Bacon’s Instagram Stories on Saturday.“Footloose” was released in 1984 and starred Bacon as a teenager who moves to a small town that forbids dancing, a measure he works to overturn.

,"Not that the film needs one, but “Challengers” actor Josh O’Connor has an alternate title idea in case the need arises: “This could be called ‘Co-dependency: The movie.’”“That was our other title!” Zendaya quips.“Challengers” – its official title – is a tennis drama from director Luca Guadagnino that serves up a thrilling love triangle and seductive performances by Zendaya, O’Connor and Mike Faist. It is set to be released this month after being delayed from its initial September 2023 release date due to the SAG-AFTRA strike.As tennis prodigy Tashi Duncan, Zendaya takes on the leading role different from anything audiences have seen from her before in projects like “The Greatest Showman” and the “Spider-Man” film franchise.In “Challengers,” Tashi becomes the object of affection for childhood best friends and fellow tennis talents, Art (Faist) and Patrick (O’Connor), as they both vie for her heart. When Tashi suddenly faces a career-ending injury at the height of her potential, she pivots to coaching, altering the course of the trio’s relationship and setting up a host of new challenges.“It’s like we’re seeing these people in real time, watching their lives cometogether and fall apart,” Zendaya said.<h2>‘I love them, and I hate them’</h2>In the film, Tashi is also seen in adulthood, having guided her husband Art to the peak of success as his coach. However, she faces the painful reality of witnessing him contemplate retirement as his remarkable career, one that seemed destined for her, draws to a close.Before his career ends, however, the stage becomes set for a reunion of sorts as Art faces off against Patrick in a key match.“I love them, and I hate them. I’m very conflicted about the decisions that they make and the things they choose to say and do to each other. But ultimately, that’s what creates strong characters,” Zendaya said.The Golden Globe winner was drawn to the role by the depth and maturity of her character. Throughout a significant portion of the film, she depicts Tashi as an older woman, embracing the part of wife and mother – a departure from her previous roles, which have often cast her as a high school student (see “Euphoria” and the “Spider-Man” series).Although she initially felt conflicted about the character’s actions when reading the script, her perspective shifted when she watched the film.“It would be very easy to make Tashi the villain,” Zendaya said. “But I think there’s so much more to her. It became my challenge to empathize with her and somehow get the audience to.”O’Connor agrees, confessing he felt sympathy for all three characters atdifferent stages of the film.“It feels like a very refreshing modern interpretation of the complexity of relationships,” he said. “That co-dependency is painful and beautiful in equal measure.”<h2>Behind the camera</h2>“Challengers” is everything audiences have come to expect from a Guadagnino film. Known for titles like “Call Me by Your Name,” “I Am Love,” and “Suspiria,” Guadagnino once again delivers a visually sumptuous and emotionally complex exploration of sexual desire.For Zendaya, whose love of filmmaking has seen her take on a greater interest in behind-the-camera work, collaborating with Guadagnino provided a new opportunity.“The more time I spend in front of the camera, the more I enjoy being behind it,” Zendaya said. In addition to her starring role, she also holds a producer’s credit on “Challengers.”“Being surrounded by Luca it helped me gain confidence. It was a beautiful place to learn and to really feel like I had a voice and a seat at the table,” she said.Zendaya is no stranger to working behind the camera. Her journey as a producer began with “Malcolm & Marie,” a 2021 romantic drama film penned and directed by Sam Levinson. Building on this experience, she collaborated with Levinson again, this time as an executive producer for the critically acclaimed HBO TV series, “Euphoria.” (CNN, like HBO, is a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery.)The learning experiences didn’t stop there, as all three actors dedicated themselves to a rigorous 12-week tennis training program led by former professional tennis player turned coach, Brad Gilbert.“We had to develop our bodies to look and act like professional tennisplayers,” Faist said. In Gilbert’s illustrious career, he was coached by Andre Agassi, the former player who had a formidable rivalry with Pete Sampras.According to Faist, Sampras and Agassi’s contrasting playing styles influenced the development of Art and Patrick as tennis players.“Andre was a little bit more rock ‘n’ roll, and Pete was more technical andformulaic. Brad read the script and drew parallels to Art and Patrick’srelationship,” he said.The result is a convincingly immersive on-screen experience that many filmgoers will consider a win.",2024-04-23 11:49:00 AM EEST,CNN,How Zendaya rose to every challenge in ‘Challengers’,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/22/entertainment/zendaya-challengers-interview/index.html
Stephen Collinson,"Republican Speaker Mike Johnson showed political courage that is rare in Washington and notable legislative skill for an inexperienced leader in forcing a long-delayed $60 billion aid bill for Ukraine through the House of Representatives on Saturday.Johnson put his own job in extreme peril to stand up for a democratic nation victimized by an unprovoked invasion by Russian strongman Vladimir Putin and to bolster America’s leadership of the West. His actions could save thousands of Ukrainian lives, even if Russia’s determination to win a bloody war in which it is targeting civilians shows no sign of fading.Johnson’s support for the bill followed a period of self-examination and a political evolution that is also unusual in the hyperpolarized Capitol. One of his senior colleagues in the House said the “transformation” involved prayer by the devout Louisiana hardline conservative, who expressed a wish to be on the right side of history.Johnson’s piloting of the bill through the House, after months of bitter infighting that split the GOP, saw him side with the diminished internationalist Ronald Reagan wing of his party while turning his back on the “America First” faction where he previously made his political home.Johnson argued that without the United States continuing its arms and ammunition lifeline to Ukraine, Russia could score a victory that would prompt it to march deeper into Europe, drawing the US into another world war. He said a failure to act would bolster the emerging de facto axis of totalitarianism between Russia, Iran and China. Two other bills that Johnson shepherded through the House in a rare Saturday session will also send new aid to Israel and Taiwan, reinforcing other vital US national security goals in two other world hot spots. Johnson’s decisions also preserved and prolonged the central planks of President Joe Biden’s foreign policy less than seven months before he seeks reelection. Classified briefings by US covert agencies appear to have played a major role in his shift in thinking — another factor likely to anger “Make America Great Again” Republicans who view the intelligence community as a “deep state” that targets ex-President Donald Trump.But Johnson argued the international situation is so grave that the House had no choice, warning that Russia, China and Iran are “a global threat to our prosperity and our security. Their advance threatens the free world, and it demands American leadership. (If) we turn our backs right now, the consequences could be devastating.”<h2>Praise from Zelensky, but Johnson has severed his ties with MAGA Republicans</h2>The significance of the remarkable events on a charged floor of the House was underscored by a message from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who had spent months warning he could lose the war if US help already worth tens of billions of dollars dried up. “I am grateful to the United States House of Representatives, both parties, and personally Speaker Mike Johnson for the decision that keeps history on the right track,” he wrote on his Telegram channel. “Democracy and freedom will always have global significance and will never fail as long as America helps to protect it.”CNN’s Frederik Pleitgen reported from Ukraine on Saturday that US aid could quickly start funneling into the country — assuming the Senate signs off on the bill, as expected. Zelensky’s forces especially need anti-aircraft missiles and new air defense systems to counter growing Russian air superiority and an expanding assault on civilian and energy infrastructure targets. Ukrainian soldiers fighting in grim trench warfare conditions have meanwhile been rationing bullets and artillery. The House vote will also offer a vitally needed boost of morale as the vicious war has turned against Ukraine in recent months.Johnson’s actions, however, represented a flagrant challenge to the populist base of the Republican Party, which is adamantly against more Ukraine aid; hews closer to Putin than Zelensky; and views America’s traditional leadership of the West as propping up globalist policies antithetical to US interests. This seam of opinion is hugely influential in the GOP and has been harnessed over the years by Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. And 112 Republicans — a majority of the conference — voted against the Ukraine bill. Millions of Americans share the ex-president’s worldview that America’s allies — who pleaded with Johnson not to abandon Ukraine — are freeloading off its defense umbrellas and that the US should take a much narrower view of its international obligations. They don’t believe that Ukraine is America’s fight and warn that standing up to Russia could lead to World War III.Johnson is also increasingly vulnerable: In passing the Ukraine bill, he repudiated the demand of right-wing Republicans to use the aid as leverage to force the Biden administration to introduce hardline policies at the US-Mexico border. In this, however, he was undercut by his own side. The president had previously agreed to many of the GOP’s demands in the most conservative immigration bill in years — but Trump’s allies in the House killed the measure, apparently to deprive Biden of a win on an issue that the ex-president sees as his path back to the White House. That move — which deprived Johnson’s tiny majority of a significant policy win — taken together with the use of Democratic votes to pass Saturday’s Ukraine measure reflects the utter disarray in a Republican Party that is at war with itself. The optics turned even more perilous for Johnson when Democrats waved Ukrainian flags on the House floor, creating a scene that is already going viral among conservatives on social media and that the speaker was quick to condemn.<h2>Johnson’s position is still far from safe</h2>Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a vehement opponent of funding Ukraine’s war effort, warned after the vote that Johnson was a “lame duck,” though she did not trigger the vote on ousting him that she had threatened in an attempt to thwart the Ukraine bill. Greene slammed Johnson for funding what she called America’s “murder industry” by supporting foreign wars and warned, “It’s unbelievable. I’m thankful that America gets to see who this man is.”The Georgia hardliner is one of at least three Republicans who have said they will support a move to oust Johnson — whose majority is so slim he cannot afford to lose any Republicans on a party-line vote and would likely need the support of Democrats to remain speaker.Greene predicted fury among grassroots Republicans as lawmakers return home for a short recess after Johnson also worked to pass vital spending bills that funded the government — in what Greene says is a betrayal of GOP voters. She may be correct in her analysis, and a slow buildup of pressure may represent Johnson’s biggest vulnerability.Still, there were also signs even among Republicans disappointed with Johnson of no appetite for another debacle that would likely unfold in seeking a new speaker so close to elections. If Johnson has correctly read the mood of those members, he may survive in a display of political dexterity that few observers expected to see after he was elevated to the speakership from the backbenches in October as almost the last resort after better-known figures failed to amass a majority after Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s ouster. But his chances of staying in his post if the GOP wins in November still seem slim. Nevertheless, in passing aid to Israel and Ukraine, Johnson may have provided a service to vulnerable freshmen Republicans in swing districts whose victories in the 2022 midterms paved the way to their party’s control of the House. One of their number, Rep. Marc Molinaro of New York, told CNN’s Manu Raju that after speaking with his constituents, “It is clear to me that there are moments in time where we must do the right thing, and today we did that.”<h2>Questions over Trump’s role</h2>One intriguing question Saturday was the position of Trump — a longtime antagonist of Zelensky and mentor of Greene, whose pressure on Kyiv to investigate Biden caused Trump’s first impeachment. Johnson traveled to Mar-a-Lago to see Trump recently and bolstered the ex-president’s false claims of election fraud in an apparent bid to shore up his own position. The ex-president, who has long genuflected to Putin, stayed on the sidelines of the Ukraine debate. It remains unclear whether he was seeking to preserve his options in the event he is the next commander in chief and wants to follow through with his vow to end the war in Ukraine. Or perhaps Trump was preoccupied with his own political goals — and his first criminal trial ahead of opening arguments on Monday.With the GOP in uproar following Saturday’s vote, Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries refused to say whether his party will back Johnson if Greene and her allies seek to unseat him with a maneuver known as a motion to vacate. Even if Democrats save Johnson as payback for the passage of the aid bills — a key Biden priority — a long-term effort to keep him in office seems unlikely. The speaker may be the most conservative person to hold the job in modern US history, and many Democrats disdain his efforts to promote Trump’s election-fraud falsehoods. And any Republican speaker propped up by Democrats might hemorrhage support among GOP lawmakers and be forced to resign.There was, however, grudging support among some Democrats for the speaker. Rep Mike Quigley, who co-chairs the Congressional Ukraine Caucus, was asked whether he had new respect for Johnson. “I guess I do,” the Illinois Democrat said. “The old adage is ‘It’s never too late to do the right thing.’ We tested that,” Quigley added. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer praised both Johnson and Jeffries, saying, “I know it was a difficult road, but the House is on the right side of history for approving this bill.”America’s enemies, including Putin, had been betting that US political divisions — exacerbated by past Russian election interference — would mean that the US would be unable to protect its traditional interests on the world stage. But Johnson put those assumptions on hold, even if the long-term prospects for continued US support for Ukraine and traditional leadership of the West look dim if Trump wins in November.But House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Mike McCaul, a Texas Republican who previously revealed Johnson had prayed for guidance, said the speaker showed true leadership. “He said, ‘I want to be on the right side of history.’ And I think he will be. And again, I think putting the nation above himself, it’s a real profile in courage, what he did.”As the debate over Ukraine aid peaked, McCaul had drawn analogies between the US posture toward Putin and Britain’s appeasement of Nazi Germany under one prime minister and the stalwart resistance of his successor. “As we deliberate on this vote, you have to ask yourself this question: Am I Chamberlain or Churchill?” he said.The accidental speaker makes an unlikely Churchill, but on Saturday he proved to be a far more daring and substantial figure than many of his Republican and Democratic critics previously believed.",2024-04-21 04:37:00 AM EEST,CNN,"By passing Ukraine aid, the accidental speaker became an unlikely Churchill",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/20/politics/mike-johnson-ukraine-aid-russia-zelensky-putin/index.html

Stephen Collinson,"Donald Trump was once, and may soon be again, the most powerful man in the world. But on Monday, his diminished reality as a criminal defendant will become clear in humbling fashion during opening statements in his first criminal trial.The presumptive GOP presidential nominee has long chafed at the constraints of the law, the Constitution and general decorum as he’s presented himself as an omnipotent force throughout his business and political career. But with jury selection now complete in his hush money trial in Manhattan, Trump’s fate is in the hands of prosecutors, his attorneys, a judge and 12 people, who, according to bedrock principles of the legal system, are regarded as peers of the ex-president. Nothing is more antithetical to Trump’s lifelong operating assumption that because of who he is, he is immune from such accountability.Just over six months from the election that could see him restored to the White House, Trump has little ability to dictate action in proceedings in which his liberty may be at stake. His normal weapons of histrionics, obfuscation and intimidation have no currency inside a courtroom. The fact that he is compelled to be in court four days a week for multiple weeks is also a serious inconvenience to the Republican candidate. This constraint was exacerbated on Saturday, one of the few windows to get out on the campaign trial, when his rally in North Carolina – a swing state that President Joe Biden is trying to flip – was canceled owing to a dangerous storm.Regardless of its outcome, this trial – and the way it’s affecting Trump’s schedule and demeanor – is underscoring how the presumptive GOP nominee is like no other presidential candidate in history. Whether or not he’s a convicted felon by Election Day, voters will be reminded of questions around his character and his many legal entanglements – with three more criminal cases looming, all in which he’s pleaded not guilty. And while Trump has used a narrative of victimhood to great success in GOP primaries, it remains to be seen how that argument lands with a broader electorate.<h2>Trump insists he will testify</h2>Trump’s unaccustomed loss of his capacity to control events may be one reason why he insists he will testify in the trial even though it might be injurious to his case. He’s already seeking to devalue the prosecution in the minds of voters who will be charged in November with deciding whether they want him again as their president.“The trial starts on Monday, which is long before a lot of people thought. The judge wants this to go as fast as possible. That’s for his reasons, not for my reasons,” Trump fumed outside the courtroom Friday. Until now, he’s found success in launching endless litigation to create delays – a legal strategy that’s still slowing down the three other criminal cases against him.The ex-president’s remarks Friday followed a contentious procedural hearing in which prosecutors and defense attorneys haggled over the evidence and past alleged misdeeds that could be brought up under cross-examination if Trump testifies. The process, known as a Sandoval hearing, offered the ex-president a glimpse of personal and unflattering revelations that the trial could dredge up.Criminal defense attorney Stacey Schneider told CNN that hearing details of past cases, including Trump’s losses in a defamation case to the writer E. Jean Carroll and the massive verdict against him in a New York civil fraud trial, had been an unpleasant experience. “I think there is an emotional tilt to what the president was dealing with just a few minutes before he came out with that statement,” Schneider said Friday. “Defendants coming out of a Sandoval hearing are not pleased; it’s just the nature of the hearing. It’s the worst preview of what could come if you take the stand. It’s rattling. I think he was rattled.”The ex-president’s fixation on his situation barely eased over the weekend. He issued a stream of angry Truth Social posts focusing on his claim that as an ex-president he’s immune from prosecution for acts in office. That case will be heard by the Supreme Court in oral arguments on Thursday. The matter focuses primarily on his federal election interference case but also has a bearing on the hush money matter since some conduct allegedly took place when he was in the Oval Office. “Of course I was entitled, as President of the United States and Commander in Chief, to Immunity,” Trump wrote in one of the Saturday posts.<h2>A case dating to the 2016 election</h2>The Manhattan trial arises from a hush money payment to former adult-film star Stormy Daniels, which prosecutors allege was made to cover up an affair to mislead voters in the 2016 election. Trump denies any affair and has pleaded not guilty to charges of falsifying business records as part of the scheme.The trial is expected to be a personally testing experience for Trump – not least because likely witnesses include former associates or friends whose testimony the ex-president is likely to view as a betrayal. They include his former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen and David Pecker, the former chairman of American Media Inc., which publishes the National Enquirer. Pecker will be the first witness called by the district attorney’s office, according to a person familiar with the plans.Prosecutors have declined to offer the defense the courtesy of full witness lists before each day of the trial, arguing that Trump’s social media attacks could put those set to testify at risk and prejudice the case. About their offer to hand over the name of the first witness by Sunday, prosecutor Joshua Steinglass had warned, “Should that be tweeted, it will be the last time.” Judge Juan Merchan has declined to force prosecutors to give advance notice of witnesses, especially with a contempt hearing scheduled for Tuesday over claims Trump violated his gag order with social media posts.<h2>A grave national moment</h2>Prosecutors in the case brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg must prove only Trump’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in the courtroom. The jurors have been extensively cross-examined to ensure they make their judgment based on the law and the evidence rather than the political overtones of the case. Yet the backdrop of an approaching election and the identity of the defendant mean there is national scrutiny on what appears, in essence, to be a fairly simple case about business records.There are, therefore, implicit questions for Bragg over the strength and advisability of a case that has made Trump the first former president to go on trial at the same time as he’s trying to get his job back. The principle that every American is equal under the law is a central issue here.Trump is baselessly arguing that he’s part of an orchestrated campaign of legal weaponization and victimization by the White House to thwart his 2024 bid. But even though there’s no evidence Biden has had any involvement in Bragg’s case, some voters may perceive this case as simply the presumptive GOP nominee being pursued by a Democratic prosecutor. Furthermore, for many voters, events arising from an election eight years ago seem remote, especially since allegations of Trump’s tawdry behavior have been well aired by now. There’s also a widely held sense that the allegations in the Manhattan trial are less serious than those facing Trump in his other three criminal indictments. Those cases, which cover efforts to subvert the 2020 election and his hoarding of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, have grave implications for democracy and the office of the presidency.<h2>Republicans seek to shield Trump politically from his legal plight</h2>Even before Trump’s daily outside-the-courtroom rants to the camera, Americans were polarized over his situation. The idea that he’s a victim of political persecution enjoys far greater acceptance outside elite political and media circles on the coasts and in the cities – even if it is not supported by the facts. In nine years on the political stage, Trump has tapped into and worsened widespread mistrust of the country’s institutions among many voters, so it’s less of a leap for him to portray this case as corrupt.The political case against the prosecutions was laid out by South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, one of a number of Trump surrogates who may be auditioning for his vice-presidential nomination in TV appearances in his defense.“I think it’s a little ridiculous that they have waited years to bring these types of charges against Donald Trump,” Noem told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday. “If they wanted to make these kinds of charges against him, they should have done it years ago, when this happened. To do it conveniently during a presidential election, when he’s campaigning to return to the White House, I think proves that this is all politically motivated.”While Trump is barred by the partial gag order from assailing witnesses, the restriction does not apply to his supporters. Noem took a chance to attack Cohen, who served time in prison after being convicted on tax charges, lying to Congress and violating campaign finance laws.Despite endless speculation, there is no way to know how voters – especially those in critical swing states – might respond to a conviction of Trump in this case, or in the other matters that look increasingly unlikely to come to trial before the election. In a New York Times/Siena poll released earlier this month, 46% of likely voters thought Trump should be found guilty in the hush money trial, while 37% thought he should not be. Attitudes about the trial largely followed party lines in the poll, which was conducted before jury selection began.While most of the pretrial focus has been on a possible conviction, an acquittal of the presumptive GOP nominee could also have unpredictable political consequences in a race that a new CNN Poll of Polls on Sunday showed as a virtual dead heat between the previous president and the current one. But Noem rehearsed a political argument that Trump and his associates will be seeking to land as the trial goes ahead. “I’m walking around this state and talking to people, talking to people across the country, they don’t even know which trial this is,” Noem said. “What they really care about is that they’re trying to figure out how to pay their gas bills. They’re trying to figure out how to pay their electricity and put food on the table for their kids.”The South Dakota governor’s downplaying of the allegations against Trump also ignores the extraordinary historic reality of an ex-president facing multiple criminal trials. But the deeply consequential political and personal stakes for the former president will become even clearer when the first trial begins for real on Monday.",2024-04-22 12:33:00 PM EEST,CNN,Opening statements to show the stark personal and political stakes of Trump’s first criminal trial,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/21/politics/trump-first-trial-opening-statements/index.html

Harry Enten,"Today is the first full day of what was my favorite Jewish celebratory holiday as a kid: Passover, which commemorates the Jews escaping bondage in ancient Egypt.This time for celebration helped to remind me of a conversation I had a month ago with my friend Noam in which I said, “Hank Greenberg would have been a top-100 baseball player had it not been for World War II.”Noam expressed some skepticism, so I decided to dig into the numbers. It turns out that I undersold Greenberg; he was one of the greatest hitters of all time and gives Sandy Koufax a run at being the greatest Jewish baseball player of all time.For those that don’t know, Greenberg was the first truly big Jewish sports star in America. He faced a lot of abuse at a time when Hitler was rising to power in Europe. Long before Koufax sat out for Yom Kippur, Greenberg did so for the Detroit Tigers during the 1934 pennant race. Yom Kippur is the holiest day on the Jewish calendar when adherents atone for their sins of the past year and don’t eat for the day.Greenberg’s religion had already made front-page news when the Detroit Free press had, about a week earlier, run a large headline in Hebrew – probably the first time a major English-speaking newspaper ever did – when he played on Rosh Hashanah (the Jewish New Year). The headline was complimentary: “And so to you, Mr. Greenberg, the Tiger fans say, ‘L’shana Tova Tikatevu!’ which means ‘Happy New Year.’”Greenberg deserved that much attention. He finished sixth in that year’s Most Valuable Player voting. The following year in 1935, he won the award, as the Tigers came out victorious in six games in the World Series. He would go on to win another MVP in 1940, before joining the armed services just a few games into the 1941 season.Greenberg could have easily gotten out of the US Army after 1941 because he was honorably discharged, and Congress released those men 28 and over from service. However, he re-enlisted after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in December of that year. Greenberg went on to serve 47 total months – more than any other major leaguer – including seeing overseas action.Greenberg returned to the diamond in 1945, smashing two home runs in another World Series win with the Tigers, but he didn’t play a full season again until 1946. By that time, at age 35, he was well past most baseball players’ prime. That year, he still hit a major league leading 44 home runs; no one else even hit 40.Greenberg would retire after the 1947 season, but not before being one of the first baseball players to offer encouragement to Jackie Robinson during his inaugural season. The 1955 World Series champion and Greenberg would remain friends until Robinson’s death in 1972.The fact that Greenberg was a hero to young Jewish baseball fans (like my father), a great American and incredible human being is not under dispute.What I fear gets forgotten sometimes is how good Greenberg was because he lost what was essentially four prime seasons to serve in the Army during the Second World War.Greenberg remains one of only 10 baseball players to ever hit 58 home runs in a single season. He led the major leagues in home runs four times, which puts him inside the top 10 for this accomplishment. Greenberg likely would have come close to, if not hit, 500 home runs had his career not been interrupted by the war. He almost certainly would have hit the 400-mark.Just three players hit 500 home runs prior to 1960 – and only 28 have through 2024. Just six players hit 400 home runs before 1960, while Greenberg’s 331 were still good enough for 12th prior to 1960. Heck, it was a good enough tally for 50th before the 1990s, when performance-enhancing drug use became widespread in MLB’s Steroids Era until the mid-2000s.His 15.69 at-bats per home run currently ranks 32nd of all-time.But what made Greenberg truly great wasn’t that he merely hit for power; he got on-base at an impressive rate.Greenberg’s on-base percentage was .412, which ranks 25th (as of this writing) for players with at least 5,000 plate appearances. He ranks 15th for those who played in the last century.Indeed, he’s one of only 21 players ever to hit at least 300 home runs and have an on-base percentage of at least .400.Greenberg didn’t just hit home runs and get on-base. He hit plenty of doubles too. Greenberg twice compiled at least 50 doubles in a season, which were the two times he led the league in the stat.Not surprisingly, his on-base plus slugging percentage (OPS) – a stat that combines getting on-base with hitting for power – was out of this world. His career 1.017 is sixth all-time for anyone with at least 5,000 plate appearances. If you adjust for the ballparks he played and the fact that Greenberg played in a hitter-friendly era, his OPS+ (which is OPS adjusted for external factors, designed to provide a context-neutral number) was 159, or 59% better than league average, and ranks 15th all time among those with at least 5,000 plate appearances.Bottom line: Greenberg is one of the greatest hitters ever to grace America’s pastime.The only real weakness in Greenberg’s game was that he didn’t contribute defensively because he played first base (a less demanding position) for most of his career.There is, however, a stat that combines offense and defense, while also taking into account that Greenberg missed out on a lot of potentially good years because of his time in the army. It’s called seven-year peak wins above replacement, or WAR7 (yes, there are a lot of very specific stats used in analyzing baseball, it’s part of what makes the sport so great).Wins above replacement is a statistic that tries to consider every part of a player’s game, while the seven means a player’s best seven seasons. For someone like Greenberg, the seven part is key because of his time missed due to his military service.Greenberg ranks 62nd among every position player on this metric since major league baseball began way back in the 1870s, according to Baseball-Reference (and different outlets compute WAR7 slightly differently). Meaning he is unquestionably one of the all-time greats, even taking into account his defense.And while I would usually advise against comparing position players and pitchers on WAR7 because they are computed very differently, I can’t help pointing out that Greenberg’s WAR7 (46.5) is very similar to Koufax’s (46.0). The “Left Arm of God” had an abbreviated career, like Greenberg, though Koufax’s was, somewhat ironically given his nickname, because of arm troubles.I think most would agree that, whenever you can even be mentioned in the same sentence as Koufax, you did something very right.In Greenberg’s case, he did a lot right both on and off the field.",2024-04-23 16:57:00 PM EEST,CNN,An ode to perhaps the greatest Jewish baseball player on Passover,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/23/sport/hank-greenberg-greatest-jewish-baseball-player-spt-intl/index.html
Zachary B. Wolf,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.Prosecutors and defense lawyers for former President Donald Trump opened the New York criminal trial on Monday by laying out their opposing sides of the case.It’s clear that a main point of contention will be what occurred at a pivotal August 2015 meeting between Trump, his former fixer Michael Cohen and the former publisher of the National Enquirer David Pecker at which they are said to have agreed to find and suppress negative stories that could affect Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.Cohen and Pecker would go on to facilitate hush money payments that benefitted Trump. The crime Trump is accused of committing is falsifying documents to hide those payments after he became president. Cohen went to prison after pleading guilty to violating campaign finance law. Pecker has cooperated with authorities.Cohen and Pecker, both now split from Trump, will be key witnesses for the prosecution, and they are expected to detail what they say occurred at this meeting where they conspired to find and kill stories unflattering to Trump.An open question will be whether the third person in that meeting, Trump, will take the stand in his own defense to give his side of the story.While he is under no obligation to testify, Trump has promised he will. Asked by a reporter at Mar-a-Lago earlier this month before the start of jury selection if it would be risky for him to take the stand, here’s what he said:“I don’t know, I’m testifying. I tell the truth. I mean, all I can do is tell the truth. And the truth is that there’s no case, they have no case,” Trump said.Last week, Trump told reporters outside the courtroom that he wants to testify.But taking the stand could lead to Trump, under oath, being asked some very uncomfortable questions.<h2>What prosecutors can and cannot ask Trump if he testifies</h2>Judge Juan Merchan, in a ruling about the scope of what Trump could be asked, took an expansive attitude, as CNN’s reporters in the courtroom, Kara Scannell, Lauren del Valle and Jeremy Herb, note.They add in their real-time courtroom posts that prosecutors can cross-examine Trump on multiple legal setbacks in recent years:► $464 million civil fraud verdict – Trump was found to fraudulently inflate the value of his properties.► Gag order violations – These were committed during the civil fraud trial for which Trump was fined $15,000.► Defamation and sexual abuse liability – Juries in federal courts found that Trump defamed former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll when he denied her rape allegations. Trump was ordered to pay $83.3 million.► His failed foundation – Trump reached a settlement with the New York attorney general that led to the dissolution of his namesake foundation.Merchan ruled prosecutors could not ask Trump, if he testifies, about his lawsuit against Hillary Clinton that a judge said was frivolous or the 2022 Trump Organization tax fraud conviction against his company.In a CNN Opinion piece, Joey Jackson, a CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney, described what kind of defense he expects from Trump’s team during the trial. Jackson argued that no matter what Trump says, whether he testifies “will likely be a game time decision.”When CNN’s Jake Tapper asked Will Scharf, one of Trump’s attorneys, if he believes Trump should testify, Scharf also said that decision should be based on “how the trial proceeds.”“I have said that I think President Trump will be a compelling witness if he does testify, because at the end of the day, he did nothing wrong,” Scharf said.<h2>When juries and a judge have seen Trump testify, he lost</h2>The first Carroll trial jury in 2023 was played a videotape of Trump’s deposition by lawyers. At one point in that testimony, Trump mistook a photo of Carroll for his ex-wife Marla Maples. Read more about key moments from the video.Trump briefly took the stand in separate defamation proceedings in January 2024.At his civil fraud trial in 2023, there was no jury, but Trump did take the stand during the proceedings. He brought a bombastic and combative style that drew rebukes from the judge in the case, Arthur Engoron, who later ordered Trump to pay a $355 million penalty.<h2>Trump has already talked about the case</h2>Even if he doesn’t testify under oath in the New York criminal trial, Trump has already said quite a bit about the case – comments that could presumably be brought into evidence. During comments outside the courtroom last week, he tried to explain the payments reimbursing Cohen for the payment to the adult film actress Stormy Daniels.“I was paying a lawyer and we marked it down as a legal expense,” Trump said. “Some accountant I didn’t know marked it down as a legal expense. That’s exactly what it was, and you get indicted over that?”In a series of tweets in May 2018, before Cohen’s ultimate guilty plea, Trump admitted to paying Cohen and said that money was a “reimbursement.”Here are those Trump tweets all together:Mr. Cohen, an attorney, received a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into, through reimbursement, a private contract between two parties, known as a non-disclosure agreement, or NDA. These agreements are…..…very common among celebrities and people of wealth. In this case it is in full force and effect and will be used in Arbitration for damages against Ms. Clifford (Daniels). The agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair,………despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair. Prior to its violation by Ms. Clifford and her attorney, this was a private agreement. Money from the campaign, or campaign contributions, played no roll in this transaction.Prosecutors also told jurors they will hear recordings Cohen made of conversations in which he and Trump discuss the payments.<h2>Not a hush money case, but an election interference case</h2>One other key thing to note out of the prosecution’s opening statement is that they want to portray this case as an election interference case rather than a hush money case.“They’re reframing this,” CNN’s Paula Reid said of prosecutors. “Not just as a paperwork crime and an effort to cover up this hush money payment by falsifying business records, but as an effort to interfere in the 2016 election.”",2024-04-23 02:25:00 AM EEST,CNN,Will Trump testify?

Zachary B. Wolf,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.Courts, legislatures, presidential campaigns and everyday Americans are all still grappling with the end of Roe v. Wade two years ago.<h2>In the courts</h2>The US Supreme Court will hear its second abortion-rights case in as many months Wednesday, when it will consider whether hospitals have an obligation under federal law to provide emergency abortions to women who are in medical emergencies.<h2>In legislatures and state governments</h2>A restrictive, six-week abortion law in the once-key electoral state of Florida goes into effect on May 1 and has Democrats hoping to use the issue to make it a battleground once again. The new Florida law has limited exemptions for rape, incest and to protect the life of the mother.A restrictive 1864 law goes back into effect for the first time in anyone’s lifetime in Arizona as early as June 8, according to the state attorney general in an online post trying to explain the law for citizens, although she says things are in “flux.” The state House has so far squashed efforts to repeal the 160-year-old abortion ban, which includes only an exemption to protect the life of the mother, but the state Senate has left the door open. Supporters of repealing the bill hope to try again in the state House to get a vote on their repeal measure.<h2>In the election</h2>President Joe Biden visited Florida to focus on abortion rights Tuesday. Vice President Kamala Harris was in Arizona recently, and she talked there to CNN’s Edward-Isaac Dovere, saying she hopes to take on the role of prosecutor against former President Donald Trump for appointing one-third of the Supreme Court that overturned Roe v. Wade.Biden and Harris very much want to protect abortion rights in federal law but currently lack the votes in both the House and Senate. Trump has said he would leave abortion policy to the states rather than try to implement a nationwide abortion restriction.Referendums placing the issue of abortion rights before voters will be on the ballot in Arizona and Florida.<h2>New reality</h2>It is the cases currently before the Supreme Court that could have the most direct effect on the new reality for pregnant American women. Justices will hear arguments Wednesday regarding a federal law from 1986 that is supposed to require hospitals that receive federal money to stabilize the health of emergency room patients.The Biden administration sued Idaho over its strict abortion ban, which does include a narrow exception for when the life of the mother is at stake but does not allow for abortion when the mother is in a medical emergency that is not yet life threatening.CNN’s Tierney Sneed has a larger look at the Idaho case, which she notes “has proceeded somewhat under the radar” and not attracted the same amount of attention as a separate case where the Supreme Court is considering the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of a drug that has been used in medical abortions for decades. Read more from Sneed.<h2>Fleeing their own states for care</h2>There is a growing number of stories of pregnant women in distress but denied emergency care in states with outright abortion bans or restrictive laws.The emergency room issue going before the Supreme Court would not have affected Jen Adkins, a woman CNN profiled in February. Adkins felt she needed to rush six hours up the freeway to Portland, Oregon, when doctors in Idaho told her that her fetus likely had a disorder that could result in a miscarriage and that continuing with the pregnancy could harm her, but that they couldn’t perform an abortion.<h2>‘Life flight insurance’</h2>In their report about Adkins, CNN’s Meg Tirrell and John Bonifield describe something new doctors are recommending for pregnant women in states with tight abortion restrictions. Tirrell and Bonifield write:Dr. Julie Lyons, a family medicine physician across the state in Hailey, near Sun Valley, who’s also a plaintiff in the lawsuit, said she now discusses “life flight insurance” with pregnant patients in their first prenatal visits, in case they have a pregnancy complication that doctors can’t treat in Idaho.“It’s a little bit terrifying to know that we can’t practice our full scope, that we are now needing to manage and triage patients, often outside of the state, to get the reproductive health care that they need,” Lyons said.Another woman, Allie Phillips, flew to New York from Tennessee to get away from her state’s restrictive abortion law and obtain care rather than carry her nonviable fetus to term. Now she’s running for a seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives, part of a “Dobbs effect” of women affected by the end of Roe v. Wade getting involved in politics. (Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization is the 2022 decision that overturned Roe.)Last year, a Texas woman, Amanda Zurawski, testified in the US Senate after she was denied an abortion when she experienced complications with her pregnancy. She was later given an emergency abortion after going into septic shock. Zurawski is suing the state of Texas.<h2>Abortion rights strategy</h2>Democrats are hoping to harness anger and fear about the loss of reproductive rights in Florida, Arizona and other states to help them in November.Biden’s trip to Florida Tuesday to highlight lack of abortion access in Trump’s adopted home is just one event in a strategic effort to focus on abortion rights and argue that exemptions to restrictive abortion laws are not working in states that have them.First lady Jill Biden, for instance, invited Kate Cox, a Texas woman, to sit with her at this year’s State of the Union address. Cox fled Texas to obtain an abortion just before the state Supreme Court denied her access to the care under the medical exemption in Texas’ abortion law. Read more from CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez and Michael Williams about the Biden campaign’s strategy.<h2>Harris settles into new role</h2>Dovere interviewed Harris in Arizona, where a state Supreme Court ruling and lack of action in the Republican-controlled legislature mean the near-total abortion ban from 1864 will likely again be law in the state.Harris, he wrote, is taking on the role of a political prosecutor during the coming election. She will try to lay out the case that Trump, who appointed justices to overturn Roe, will take away freedoms if he’s returned to the White House.From Dovere’s report:“The prosecutor approach is really about just deconstructing an issue,” she said. “It’s presenting and reminding folks about the empirical evidence that shows us exactly how we arrived at this point. … He can’t hide from this stuff.”Just before coming on stage in Arizona, Harris and a few aides scrambled to add in a line to go right at what Trump had said minutes before — that the US Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade is “working the way it is supposed to.”Women facing the prospect of needing to seek a court order for an emergency abortion or being forced out of state are unlikely to agree.This story has been updated with additional information.",2024-04-24 16:19:00 PM EEST,CNN,"Abortion rights: New state bans, yet another Supreme Court case and Biden’s Florida dream",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/23/politics/abortion-rights-supreme-court-what-matters/index.html
Matt Stiles,"The US Senate on Tuesday passed a $95 billion foreign aid package aimed at bolstering support for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, ending months of legislative wrangling among lawmakers over extending help to the American allies.The package, which passed on a 79-18 bipartisan vote, combined four bills approved by the US House on Saturday. It allotted nearly $61 billion for Ukraine, more than $26 billion for Israel and more than $8 billion for countries in the Indo-Pacific region.The measure also includes a provision that could result in TikTok being banned from American app stores unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, sells the video-sharing platform within nine months.The funding passed with the support of 46 Democrats, 31 Republicans and 2 independents, following hours of speeches by senators.

"Katie Lobosco,Tami Luhby,Brian Fung","The Senate passed a foreign aid package Tuesday that includes money for Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific region.The House passed the aid package, in the form of four separate bills, on Saturday – months after the Senate first passed legislation with aid for Ukraine and Israel.The new legislation, which will now go to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature, also includes a number of House GOP priorities, including sanctions on Iran, the seizure of frozen Russian sovereign assets and a measure that could lead to a nationwide ban of TikTok.The aid for Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific region adds up to about $95 billion – the same amount that the earlier Senate bill passed in February would have provided – with an adjustment that $10 billion in Ukraine economic assistance is in the form of a repayable loanHere’s what’s included in the foreign aid package, according to summaries provided by House Republicans:<h2>Nearly $61 billion for Ukraine</h2>The legislation includes a total of nearly $61 billion to assist Ukraine and others in the region fight Russia – about the same that was included in the earlier Senate bill.Of that total, about $23 billion would be used to replenish US weapons, stockpiles and facilities, and more than $11 billion would fund current US military operations in the region.Nearly $14 billion included in the bill would help Ukraine buy advanced weapons systems and other defense equipment.<h2>More than $26 billion for Israel</h2>The package would provide $26.4 billion to aid Israel, specifying that the funds are to support “its effort to defend itself against Iran and its proxies, and to reimburse US military operations in response to recent attacks,” according to a summary of the legislation.The funding includes $4 billion for the Iron Dome and David’s Sling missile defense systems and $1.2 billion for the Iron Beam defense system, which counters short-range rockets and mortar threats.It would also provide $4.4 billion to replenish defense items and services provided to Israel and $3.5 billion for the procurement of advanced weapons systems and other items through the Foreign Military Financing Program. Plus, it would provide additional flexibility for transfers of defense items to Israel from US stockpiles held in other countries and would prohibit sending funds to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, which supports Palestinian refugees and has come under fire after Israel alleged some of its staff were involved in Hamas’ October 7 attack.Also included is $9.2 billion in humanitarian assistance – including emergency food, shelter and basic services – to populations suffering crises.The earlier Senate bill, by comparison, would have provided $14.1 billion in assistance to Israel, including funds for missile defense systems and foreign military financing to help Israel reestablish territorial security and deterrence, and $9.2 billion in humanitarian aid.<h2>More than $8 billion for Indo-Pacific security</h2>The package includes $8.1 billion to counter China’s actions in the Indo-Pacific region. It includes $3.3 billion to develop submarine infrastructure, $2 billion in foreign military financing for Taiwan and other key allies, and $1.9 billion to replenish defense items and services provided to Taiwan and regional partners.The earlier Senate bill contained very similar provisions to bolster security in the region.<h2>Potential TikTok ban</h2>One hot-button provision of the package could lead to a possible nationwide ban of TikTok, the popular social media app with links to China.An earlier version of the TikTok bill sailed through the House in March. By including it in the aid package, House Republicans hoped to force the Senate to a quick vote on a measure supporters say is necessary to protect Americans’ personal data from the Chinese government. Opponents, including TikTok and a range of civil society groups, argue that the bill risks violating the First Amendment rights of TikTok’s users.The legislation passed Tuesday sets out a nine-month timeframe for the app’s Chinese parent, ByteDance, to sell the social media company. If it misses the deadline, TikTok would be banned from US app stores. The proposed time limit is longer than the roughly six months considered in previous legislation. And it would give the president the option to extend the deadline by another 90 days if he determines there’s been progress toward a sale.The changes appear aimed at addressing concerns by some senators that the original six-month deadline may have been too short.<h2>Iran sanctions, Russian assets</h2>The legislation also contains what House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul calls “the most comprehensive sanctions against Iran Congress has passed in years.”It would place sanctions on ports and refineries that receive and process Iranian oil and on anyone involved in activity covered under the UN missile embargo on Iran that lapsed last year or in the supply or sale of Iran’s missiles and drones. It would also further restrict the export of goods and technology of US origin to Iran.Plus, the legislation would empower the executive branch to seize and transfer frozen Russian assets held in the US to Ukraine to help it fight and rebuild. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said that he was considering the measure – known as the REPO Act – as a way to aid Ukraine.Top Biden administration officials have also been working with G7 allies – which include Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the European Union – to explore the novel strategy to help Ukraine, which would require congressional approval. The vast majority of Russia’s central bank assets that were frozen by the G7 and the EU are held by the EU, with the US only holding around $5 billion worth, officials told CNN.In addition, the package would place mandatory sanctions on Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and other Palestinian terrorist groups.This headline and story have been updated with additional information.CNN’s Lauren Fox, Haley Talbot, Melanie Zanona and Natasha Bertrand contributed to this report.",2024-04-24 12:47:00 PM EEST,CNN,"Here’s what’s in the foreign aid package for Ukraine, Israel",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/17/politics/ukraine-israel-foreign-aid-bill/index.html
Tierney Sneed,"Two years after ending the national right to abortion by overturning Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court on Wednesday will scrutinize one of the marquee efforts by the Biden administration to preserve abortion access in the post-Roe v. Wade era.The Biden administration is challenging Idaho’s enforcement of its abortion ban in medical emergencies, putting a spotlight on what has been one of the most politically explosive flashpoints in the aftermath of Roe’s demise.The Justice Department maintains that federal law requires hospitals to offer abortions if necessary to stabilize the health of emergency room patients, even in states like Idaho that ban that procedure. At the time the lawsuit was filed, Attorney General Merrick Garland characterized the case as part of the department’s promise to “work tirelessly to protect and advance reproductive freedom” in the wake of Roe’s reversal.The lawsuit has proceeded somewhat under the radar and has been overshadowed by the other blockbuster abortion case at the Supreme Court this year, concerning the federal regulations for abortion pills. Yet, the Idaho case could yield the most significant ruling from the court on abortion since the 2022 Roe reversal and one that could further elevate an issue Democrats want front and center in the 2024 election this November.Idaho argues that the Biden administration is trying to retrofit the federal law known as EMTALA – or the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act – to “create a nationwide abortion mandate in hospital emergency rooms.”Idaho’s abortion law has a narrow exemption for abortions provided to save a pregnant woman’s life. However, the Justice Department argues that federal law overrides state abortion bans that prohibit emergency room doctors from offering the procedure to women whose pregnancies are causing medical emergencies that are not yet life-threatening.“Many pregnancy complications do not pose a threat to the woman’s life when she arrives at the emergency room – but delaying care until necessary to prevent her death could allow her condition to deteriorate, placing her at risk of acute and long-term complications,” the Justice Department told the high court in a brief.Anti-abortion advocates meanwhile hope the Supreme Court will use the case to rebuke what they say is an unlawful Biden administration effort to undermine its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson, the ruling that overturned Roe.“This is an opportunity for the Supreme Court to push back against the Biden administration’s campaign of massive resistance to the Dobbs decision,” said Roger Severino, a vice president of domestic policy for the conservative Heritage Foundation.<h2>A 1986 emergency room health care law brings abortion back to the Supreme Court</h2>A bipartisan Congress enacted EMTALA in 1986 to address the issue of “patient dumping,” the practice by hospitals to refuse emergency room care to patients, often uninsured, in order to save costs.The Justice Department sued Idaho under the law just over a month after the Supreme Court’s Dobbs ruling cleared the way for the state to enact a strict abortion ban, and within weeks the administration secured a lower court order blocking Idaho’s abortion ban in scenarios of medical emergencies. Until the order was put on pause by higher courts, including the Supreme Court, it was the rare example of a successful action the Biden administration was able to take to try to mitigate the effects of Roe’s reversal.It is also a case that highlights what has been a particularly troubling narrative for the anti-abortion movement post-Dobbs: that abortion bans – even those with ostensible life-of-the-mother exemptions – are putting the health of pregnant women in jeopardy.“Those stories are hugely sympathetic to the public, to voters,” said Gretchen Borchelt, the vice president for reproductive rights and health at the National Women’s Law Center, which is supporting the Biden administration in the case. “I think that crystallizes for people the fallout of the Dobbs decision in a way that nothing else is.”John Bursch, the vice president of appellate advocacy for the conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, which is Idaho’s co-counsel in the case, told CNN that it was a “scare tactic” to claim that Idaho’s ban did not adequately protect women facing complications from their pregnancy, as he sought to distance the case from abortion politics.“Protecting the mother’s life is always possible when that’s the only choice that you have,” he said. “So, this case really isn’t about that. And it’s really not even about abortion, although the other side is trying to make it about that.”(Health care providers in Idaho have said that in the few months that the abortion ban has been in effect, it has prevented them from providing abortions to patients who were suffering pregnancy complications causing them organ failure and other severe conditions – including conditions that would threaten their future fertility.)Bursch framed the case around the question of “whether EMTALA was an intentional attempt by the federal government to take control of the state practice of medicine.”“And no one ever thought that before Dobbs,” he said.In the other major abortion case on the docket this term, a challenge brought by anti-abortion doctors to how the federal government has regulated the abortion drug known as mifepristone, the justices in oral arguments indicated they were leaning towards rejecting the case because the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the suit.“Even if they kick out the mifepristone case on standing, to decide to make it harder for people get emergency abortion care is going to have huge ramifications for voters,” Borchelt said.In a troubling sign for the administration in this case, the Supreme Court paused lower court rulings that partially blocked Idaho’s abortion ban and agreed to take up the case before the lower courts had fully considered it on the merits. There were no public dissents to those moves.<h2>Must hospitals provide ‘equal’ emergency treatment for pregnant women and their fetuses?</h2>The case could turn on how the justices read the term “unborn child” in EMTALA. The term is referenced multiple times in the law, which includes scenarios in its definition of medical emergencies where the health of an unborn child is in serious jeopardy and transfers of patients in labor that would put the safety of their unborn child at risk are restricted.The references to the “unborn child” were added by Congress in 1989 to make clear the EMTALA’s protections applied to women who showed up to hospitals because they were in labor or facing other pregnancy-related medical emergencies.Supreme Court briefs filed by Idaho point to the language to argue that EMTALA’s “text demands equal treatment for ‘the unborn child.’”“To say that a statute that requires the protection of the unborn somehow requires doctors to take their lives in emergency rooms, it’s just nonsensical,” Bursch told CNN.The Charlotte Lozier Institute, an anti-abortion think tank, said in a friend-of-the-court brief that EMTALA “expressly protects the lives of unborn children” and that it requires hospitals “to follow the two-patient paradigm to protect both the mother and her unborn child.”“The United States’ attempt to diminish the ‘unborn child’s’ life as secondary—one that must be protected only if her mother’s health is not threatened but loses all value if her mother’s health is in jeopardy—is atextual,” the brief said. “Congress expected hospitals and physicians to preserve both lives wherever possible.”Idaho’s opponents counter that the provisions in question were meant to ensure that ER patients whose pregnancies were in medical trouble would receive treatment for those complications, even if the women themselves did not face serious risks to their health or possible death.“I think it’s incredibly dangerous, the implications of what the argument Idaho is trying to push, with respect to the term and the use of the unborn child in the statute,” said Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, the deputy director of the Reproductive Freedom Project of the ACLU, which filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case.Abortion rights advocates fear that, beyond just the dispute over Idaho’s abortion ban, the conservative majority will issue a ruling that will encourage the anti-abortion movement to take more aggressive steps in their push towards fetal personhood.“We have this case for the court where they are going to be talking about what the term ‘unborn child’ means. And so even though it’s going to be specific to EMTALA, and its definition there, what we’re going to see is anti-abortion folks seize on that, policymakers seize on what the court says,” said Borchelt of the National Women’s Law Center.Bursch said it was “laughable” to claim the case, depending on the court rules, could lay groundwork for fetal personhood and framed the case as being more about states’ authority to regulate medicine within their borders.“This case is about whether EMTALA regulates that state’s practice of medicine and overrides Idahoans’ choice to preserve life,” Bursch said.",2024-04-24 15:53:00 PM EEST,CNN,Reagan-era emergency health care law is the next abortion flashpoint at the Supreme Court,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/20/politics/abortion-supreme-court-idaho-emergency-care/index.html
Arlette Saenz,"The Senate’s vote on Tuesday to approve new aid for Ukraine capped off six months of public pressure and private overtures by the White House to build support, including the not-insignificant task of winning over House Speaker Mike Johnson.For months, Biden and his team pressed the case for additional aid both publicly and privately, leaning into courting Johnson – whose young speakership was under pressure from his right flank – behind the scenes through White House meetings, phone calls and detailed briefings on the battlefield impacts, administration officials said.Grappling with the leadership dynamics in a House GOP conference increasingly resistant to more aid, Biden directed his team to use every opportunity possible to lay out the consequences of inaction directly to Johnson. That included warnings of what it would mean not just for Ukraine, but also Europe and the US, if Russian President Vladimir Putin were to succeed, administration officials said.The president specifically urged his team to lean into providing a full intelligence picture of Ukraine’s battlefield situation in their conversations with the speaker and his staff as well as discussing the national security implications for the US, officials said. That push played out over the next six months – starting with a Situation Room briefing one day after Johnson became speaker.National security adviser Jake Sullivan and Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young briefed the speaker and other key lawmakers on how aid for Ukraine was running out, putting the country’s efforts to fight off Russia in jeopardy. Biden stopped by the meeting and met with Johnson on the side to convey a similar message. Sullivan followed up four days later with a call to Johnson to highlight the measures in place to track aid in Ukraine.But Johnson quickly made clear aid for Ukraine and Israel would need to be separated – an approach the White House opposed and one that would be tested time and time again in the coming months.The ordeal ended on Tuesday when the Senate passed the $95 billion foreign aid package, with nearly $61 billion for Ukraine, marking a long-sought foreign policy win for Biden, who has spent the past two years rallying Western support for the war-torn country in its fight against Russia. At the same time, the president has been grappling with his own battle back home to get more aid approved amid resistance from some Republicans. The White House has said he will sign that legislation – which also provides over $26 billion for Israel and humanitarian assistance and more than $8 billion for the Indo-Pacific, including Taiwan – as soon as possible.Biden sought to make the case for a robust aid package early on, using a primetime Oval Office address in mid-October to tie Ukraine’s battle against Russia to Israel’s nascent war with Hamas as he prepared to make a new funding request to Congress.“Hamas and Putin represent different threats, but they share this in common: They both want to completely annihilate a neighboring democracy, completely annihilate it,” Biden said in that speech “We can’t let petty partisan, angry politics get in the way of our responsibilities as a great nation. We cannot and will not let terrorists like Hamas and tyrants like Putin win.”<h2>Biden tells his team not to attack Johnson</h2>Less than a week after that speech, the White House faced the task of working with a new House speaker who was relatively unknown to them and had previously voted against assistance for Ukraine as a rank-and-file member.The president tasked his team with staying in regular contact with Johnson, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a staunch supporter of more aid for Ukraine.Another early directive from the president to his team – try to refrain from targeted attacks against Johnson as much as possible and instead focus on the greater need for Republicans to act, hoping to give more space for productive conversations.“He just kept saying, ‘Keep talking. Keep working.’ You know, keep finding ways to resolve differences. And that was his direction,” said Steve Ricchetti, counselor to the president.Richetti and Shuwanza Goff, director of legislative affairs, served as the main conduits between the White House and Johnson and his team. Ricchetti spoke regularly with Johnson over the past four weeks and traveled up to Capitol Hill with Goff to meet with Johnson and his team in December and March. They spoke often with Johnson’s staff, including meetings at the White House and on Capitol Hill.Meanwhile, White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, Ricchetti and Goff spoke with Schumer and Jeffries and their staff almost daily to strategize on how to push Ukraine aid forward. Zients, Ricchetti, Goff and Young also stayed in regular contact with McConnell, who was eager to push the effort along in the Senate.The administration also facilitated regular briefings for House members on Ukraine, working closely with the bipartisan national security committee chairs, including House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul and Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Michael Turner.CIA Director Bill Burns hosted Johnson’s staff in late March to talk through the dire situation in Ukraine on top of briefings for Republican chairs of the relevant national security committees.The US Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink met with Johnson, McConnell, and other GOP senators as well as House and Senate Republican staff. The Defense Department held briefings for House Republicans, and the administration also briefed Reps. Chip Roy of Texas and Ralph Norman of South Carolina at Johnson’s request, administration officials said.Over at the White House, Biden’s senior team gathered at an oval table in Zients’ office each morning to run through how to stress the need for more aid. Those meetings included Zients, Ricchetti, Goff, Young, senior adviser Anita Dunn, Sullivan and deputy national security adviser Jon Finer.<h2>The border becomes a sticking point</h2>Just after Thanksgiving, the president urged his advisers to make clear funding was drying up and Congress needed to act. Young, Sullivan and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met with congressional leadership to convey that message. Young sent a sharply worded letter to lawmakers warning the US will “kneecap Ukraine on the battlefield” if funding was not approved.The White House even tapped Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to make a direct pitch to Johnson in a meeting just before Christmas in Washington, DC. But even Biden seemed to acknowledge the challenging road ahead for Ukraine aid as he met with Zelensky at the White House, saying the US would continue to provide weapons and military equipment to the country for “as long as we can,” a subtle shift from his previous pledge to support Ukraine “as long as it takes.”After entering the year without a deal in hand, the president invited Johnson, McConnell, Jeffries, Schumer and the national security committee chairs to the White House to make the case for aid to Ukraine. Sullivan and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines outlined specific examples of the possible ramifications of not getting Ukraine additional US funding.But those conversations further laid bare the need for action to address an influx of migrants at the US southern border that had become too big of a political problem for the president and his aides to ignore. Republican and Democratic senators had been working for months on a border security measure to couple with aid for Ukraine and Israel. A bipartisan group of senators eventually came together on a deal in early February and the door appeared to be open.At former President Donald Trump’s urging, the door closed and the deal fell apart. Biden publicly blamed Republicans in Congress for the failed package.<h2>Foreign aid bill moves forward on its own</h2>Senate leaders then moved forward with the bipartisan supplemental national security package without a border deal soon after, putting the ball back in Johnson’s court in the House.Biden hosted Johnson and congressional leaders again at the White House at the end of February to discuss efforts to avoid a partial government shutdown and push for greater aid for Ukraine. Burns was on hand to run through how Ukraine had been impacted as its troops dealt with low munitions with the aid bill languishing as the war hit the two year mark.In the six weeks that followed, administration officials saw a sense of urgency pick up as lawmakers continued to receive more assessments and briefings on the battlefield landscape. But Iran’s attack on Israel on April 13 also altered the dynamic, with momentum for getting assistance to Israel building in the days that followed.One day after the attack, Johnson indicated to Jeffries that he was ready to support foreign aid, a move that infuriated his right flank and has put the future of his speakership in jeopardy. Biden and Johnson spoke by phone the next day as the speaker briefed him on his plan to move the aid package forward. The speaker told reporters he moved ahead with the aid votes due to “precipitating events around the globe.”Sources previously told CNN a briefing from Burns, who painted a dire picture of the situation on the battlefield for Ukraine and the global consequences of inaction, was part of Johnson’s motivation in pushing the aid package forward, even as his own political future was up in the air.The House ultimately passed the $95 billion aid package on Saturday – a moment Biden celebrated in separate calls with the speaker and Jeffries. The Ukraine aid measure passed with the support of 210 Democrats and 101 RepublicansAhead of the final passage, Biden spoke with Zelensky on Monday, assuring him help was on the way after months of waiting.“We discussed the contents of the next US military aid package,” Zelensky said. “The president has assured me that the package will be approved quickly and that it will be powerful, strengthening our air defense as well as long-range and artillery capabilities.”",2024-04-24 17:05:00 PM EEST,CNN,How the White House convinced Mike Johnson to back Ukraine aid,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/24/politics/white-house-ukraine-funding-push/index.html
"Natasha Bertrand,Alex Marquardt","The Biden administration is preparing a new aid package for Ukraine that is expected to be worth around $1 billion, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN.The Senate passed the legislation Tuesday night, sending it to the White House for Biden’s signature as soon as Wednesday.In briefings to Congress in recent weeks, administration officials have indicated that the US will likely send Ukraine long-range ATACMS, or Army Tactical Missile Systems, for the first time as part of the new aid package, three of the sources said.Last fall the US first sent Ukraine the midrange variant of the ATACMS missile system, which can reach about 100 miles, while the longer-range version can reach as far as 190 miles.Ukrainian officials have been asking the US both in private and in public for the long-range missile to target deeper behind Russian lines. American officials have resisted, citing both supplies and further provoking Moscow as excuses.But US officials have been describing the situation on the Ukrainian battlefield in increasingly dire terms over the last several months, as US aid stalled amid gridlock in Congress over the administration’s $60 billion supplemental funding request.CIA Director Bill Burns testified earlier this month that Ukraine could lose the war by the end of this year without US support, and the top US general for Europe, EUCOM commander Gen. Chris Cavoli, told Congress that the Russians have such an advantage in artillery ammunition that they will soon be outfiring the Ukrainians 10-to-1. Broadly, Russia has maintained a “significant quantitative advantage” over Ukraine in terms of munitions, manpower and equipment, a NATO official said earlier this month.Sen. Mark Warner, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CBS’ Face the Nation on Sunday that he hopes ATACMS missiles will be sent to Ukraine by the end of next week.“It should have happened six months ago. The next best time is right now. This week, we’ve seen the Ukrainians overperform if you step back for a moment and think about the fact that for most of my life, most of America’s defense forces were focused on Russia,” Warner said. “Getting this additional equipment as quickly as possible, I hope once this gets to the President by Tuesday or Wednesday, that these shipments will be literally launched with that longer range ATACMS.”Republican Sen. Roger Wicker, ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement after the bill passed on Tuesday that “the delayed ATACMS delivery has cost unnecessary lives and prolonged the war. While this legislation could push pivotal momentum toward securing victory, it should not have required an act of Congress for President Biden to deliver the deep-strike missiles to Ukraine.”The package is also expected to include more desperately needed munitions for Ukraine, including air defense and artillery ammunition, Bradley fighting vehicles and demolition weaponry, the sources said.The text of the legislation passed by both chambers of Congress requires the administration to transfer the coveted longer-range ATACMS “as soon as practicable,” unless the president determines that doing so would be detrimental to US national security interests.The military aid will be sourced from the US’ own stockpiles through a funding mechanism known as presidential drawdown authority, or PDA, and will be the first PDA package for Ukraine since March. It will be significantly larger than that package, however, which was worth only around $300 million that the Pentagon was able to scrounge together from cost savings elsewhere in the department.A White House official declined to comment on the contents of the PDA except to say that the US is “prepared to quickly send military aid to Ukraine to meet their urgent battlefield and air defense needs as soon as the supplemental passes the Senate and is signed into law.”US European Command is working to process the weaponry so that it can flow into Ukraine as efficiently as possible, officials told CNN.Celeste Wallander, assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, told lawmakers earlier this month that the Pentagon could begin transferring the aid “within a week or two” after the legislation passed.This story has been updated with additional information.",2024-04-24 17:23:00 PM EEST,CNN,New US military aid package to Ukraine expected to be worth around $1 billion,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/23/politics/us-ukraine-military-aid-package/index.html
