Erika Edwards,"Warnings about  fake Botox injections  given by people not trained to give the shots are growing. On Friday, the  New York City Health Department  said that three people have had to go to emergency departments after getting injections of botulinum toxin in their face, neck, upper back or armpits.Within days or weeks of getting the shots, the three developed a range of symptoms, from double vision and drooping eyelids to difficulty swallowing, breathing and raising their arms.Two were hospitalized, and one needed to be admitted to an intensive care unit.  The new insights come as both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration investigate other cases of people who’ve had to be hospitalized with potentially severe side effects after getting fake Botox shots from unlicensed providers.On Friday, the CDC reported that  at least 22 people in 11 states  have had bad reactions,   including slurred speech, trouble breathing and blurry vision, after receiving counterfeit versions of the wrinkle-smoothing treatment. No deaths have been reported. All are women between the ages of 25 and 59, most around age 40. The women had received the shots in “non-healthcare settings,” such as homes and spas, the CDC said. Reports of symptoms possibly related to the fake Botox were first reported in early November 2023.“People should not be getting injections from friends or at parties,” NYC Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan said in a  press release  Friday. “A price that is too good to be true, or if a service provider does not explain the risks and side effects of the procedure, are clear warning signs that the products or services may not be legitimate and could pose a risk to your health.”The  FDA  said that there’s no indication that authentic Botox, from the drugmaker AbbVie, is linked to any of the illnesses.The drug uses a purified form of a neurotoxin called botulinum toxin that causes muscle paralysis. Injected in precise amounts into specific areas of the face, it can relax muscles that cause wrinkles.In an email to NBC News, the FDA said that it’s “actively working” with state and federal health authorities to investigate the source of counterfeit Botox.“The question is, is this ‘faux-tox’ all one and the same?” asked Dr. Adam Friedman, a dermatologist and chair of dermatology at George Washington University. “Or are multiple people creating different versions of it? We don’t know the answer to that.”Dr. Kate Dee, a physician and founder of Glow Medispa in Seattle, blamed the recent illnesses on  unregulated medical spas , which have ballooned in recent years, becoming a  $15 billion  wellness industry. “The problem is not that there’s fake Botox around and doctors might accidentally use it. That’s not what’s happening. Doctors get real Botox, and we pay lots of money to do things legally and legitimately,” she said. “It’s these people who are busy trying to make money from the med spa industry, the esthetics industry, who are getting it because it’s so much cheaper.”Cases linked to counterfeit Botox have been detected so far in California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. At least 11 patients have been hospitalized, according to the CDC.Some symptoms, such as blurred vision and drooping eyelids, appeared near the injection site, while others were more widespread, including fatigue and generalized weakness.Other potentially concerning symptoms could include constipation, incontinence, dry mouth and difficulty lifting the head, the FDA said.The difference in side effects from fake BotoxUsually, adverse events related to real Botox injections are the result of “poor technique,” such as injecting the toxin into the wrong muscle or in the wrong location, Friedman said.“But if these patients might be going into respiratory distress or failure because of systemic poisoning,” he said, “that’s different from what doctors usually see.”The FDA said there are several ways to identify counterfeit Botox products:Dee recommends that patients ask to see the vial of toxin before getting the shots. “At the very least, look at the vial because if it’s in any other language besides English, it’s not real Botox.”",2024-04-19 23:45:00 PM EEST,NBC,"Where is the 'faux-tox' coming from?

Aria Bendix,"Health agencies in the U.S. and Europe say there’s no evidence that thoughts of suicide or self-harm are linked to the popular weight loss and diabetes drug semaglutide, which is sold under the brand names Ozempic and Wegovy. After a nine-month review, the  European Medicines Agency concluded  Friday that “the available evidence does not support a causal association” between GLP-1 receptor agonists, the drug class that includes semaglutide, and suicidal thoughts or actions. The  Food and Drug Administration arrived at a similar conclusion  in January. The agency examined reports of suicidal thoughts or actions to its adverse event reporting system, but a  preliminary review  found there wasn’t a clear link to the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists. However, the FDA said in a statement it “cannot definitively rule out that a small risk may exist” and would continue to look into the issue.As  semaglutide rose in popularity  last year, a small number of users  reported suicidal thoughts  while taking it. As of December, the  FDA’s adverse event reporting system  had received 157 reports of suicidal ideation attributed to Ozempic and 18 attributed to Wegovy. By comparison, more than 2.6 million people in the U.S. were prescribed semaglutide from January 2018 to September 2023, according to data provided to NBC News by Epic Research, a health analytics firm.“I don’t think that we can say that the question is completely closed, but the evidence that we have so far is reassuring,” said Dr. Eduardo Grunvald, an obesity medicine physician at UC San Diego Health. He consults for Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, but  did not speak on behalf of the company. Novo Nordisk told NBC News it “stands behind the safety and efficacy” of its GLP-1 drugs when used correctly and taken under the care of a licensed health care professional. The company said it will continue to monitor reports of adverse reactions, including suicide and suicidal ideation.“We look forward to working with FDA as they complete their review,” the company said in a statement.The FDA approved Wegovy for weight loss in 2021. The agency requires any chronic weight management medicine that works on the central nervous system to carry a warning about suicidal ideation. Wegovy fits that bill, so its prescribing label tells doctors to monitor for depression or suicidal thoughts.Ozempic, a different dosage of semaglutide, does not carry such a warning, since it’s only approved to treat Type 2 diabetes — though some doctors prescribe it off-label for weight loss.Semaglutide was shown in trials to  significantly lower blood sugar levels  and  cut body weight  by an average of 15%.“Overall, clearly, the benefits are winning the race compared to the risks of these drugs,” Grunvald said.A  Nature Medicine study  in January found that people taking semaglutide were  up to 73% less likely to report suicidal thoughts  than people taking other weight loss or diabetes medications. The study analyzed the medical records of nearly 1.6 million patients with Type 2 diabetes and more than 240,000 patients with obesity. One analysis in particular followed two groups, each with around 53,000 patients who had obesity or were overweight but had no history of suicidal thoughts. The first group was prescribed semaglutide, while the second was prescribed anti-obesity drugs that weren’t GLP-1 receptor agonists. After about six months, no one in the semaglutide group had reported a suicide attempt, whereas 14 people in the other group did.The trend was similar for people with a history of suicidal thoughts who were overweight or had obesity, as well as those who were taking semaglutide for Type 2 diabetes.“We saw a lower risk associated with semaglutide compared to other medications, but we don’t know exactly the mechanism yet,” said Rong Xu, the author of the study and a professor of biomedical informatics at Case Western Reserve University.“We’re not saying the risk is zero,” she added. “We just compared to other medications and we didn’t see an increase.”Doctors who regularly prescribe semaglutide say there may be other reasons why patients taking the medication report suicidal thoughts. Among their leading theories: Semaglutide mimics a hormone in the gut that signals to people that they’re full, so they eat less. That might negatively affect people’s moods if they normally use food to cope with depression.“That doesn’t mean that it causes suicidal ideation. It just means that it may dampen your feeling pleasure from certain foods that you’re used to eating to hide your feelings of depression,” said Dr. Caroline Apovian, co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, who sits on Novo Nordisk’s scientific advisory board.Bariatric surgery works similarly in terms of suppressing appetite, Apovian said, and  suicide rates are at least four times higher  among people who have undergone bariatric surgery than among the general population.For the most part, however, doctors say semaglutide improves the health of patients with obesity.“From my clinical experience, people in general overwhelmingly feel much better after they’ve lost this weight,” Grunvald said. “They feel physically better, and they also many times feel emotionally better.”If you or someone you know is in crisis, call 988 to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.

Erika Edwards,"Fake Botox is behind 19 reports of vision problems and difficulty breathing and swallowing in at least nine states, the  Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday .The products in question were obtained from  unlicensed sources , and ""may be misbranded, adulterated, counterfeit, contaminated, improperly stored and transported, ineffective and/or unsafe,"" the  agency wrote on its website.

Berkeley Lovelace Jr.,"The Food and Drug Administration  said  Tuesday it’s winding down some of its U.S. response to lead-contaminated cinnamon applesauce pouches, which have  sickened hundreds of children  across the country. The FDA will continue to actively investigate how  WanaBana’s apple cinnamon fruit puree pouches , which were recalled in late October because of high lead levels, became contaminated. However, much of the work the agency has done to ensure no one else buys the  applesauce pouches  has ended.The agency has  pulled the product  from stores and prevented any more of it from being imported into the United States.  Two other products made by WanaBana  — Schnucks applesauce pouches with cinnamon and Weis cinnamon applesauce — were also recalled and removed from stores.The WanaBana pouches had been sold at discount retail stores, including Dollar Tree. For several months after the recall, there were  reports of it still being on store shelves .""It would be comforting to see data about how many stores had the products listed as contaminated and to see how they've ensured the removal of those products from store shelves,"" said Laurie Beyranevand, director of the Center for Agriculture and Food Systems at Vermont Law and Graduate School. “These concerns are especially important given the prevalence of those stores being located in communities with lower incomes.""The FDA did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment.The issue will be transferred from the agency’s outbreak response team to its post-investigations unit, where officials will continue to determine exactly how the applesauce pouches became contaminated with lead.The leading hypothesis is that the cinnamon in the applesauce was contaminated with lead. In February, according to the FDA,  Ecuadorian officials identified a cinnamon processor as ""the likely source of contamination."" The processor sourced his cinnamon from Sri Lanka. The Ecuadorian officials said that the cinnamon sticks were lead-free before they were processed, and contaminated after processing. That cinnamon was then sent to a supplier in Ecuador called Negasmart and, in turn, to a facility, Austrofoods, where the applesauce pouches were produced before being exported to the U.S.The FDA will continue to review reports of lead poisoning that are voluntarily submitted to it; however, it says there may not be enough information for follow-up. The FDA’s new focus will largely transition to surveillance and prevention. In March, the agency said it  identified more cinnamon products  sold at discount retail stores that had elevated lead levels.The FDA, along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had been working with state health officials to track cases of lead poisoning in the U.S. linked to the pouches.Because the applesauce pouches have a long shelf life, agency officials were concerned that they may still have been in people's homes after the recall. As of March, the CDC said that it had received 519 reports of confirmed, suspected and probable cases of lead poisoning linked to the pouches from 44 states. Many young children were among the people sickened. The announcement comes less than a week after FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf  testified before a congressional committee  in part on the agency’s applesauce response.He called on Congress to pass legislation that would require food manufacturers to test for lead in imported foods. Although many food manufacturers do test for harmful chemicals in their products, there is no federal requirement for them to do so.",2024-04-16 20:15:00 PM EEST,NBC,FDA winds down part of lead-contaminated applesauce probe,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-winds-part-lead-contaminated-applesauce-probe-rcna146589
"Isabela Espadas Barros Leal,Albinson Linares","Though American and Mexican women have long relied on one another for abortion care, the impending  restrictions in Arizona  are set to create a regional lack of access that spans into the neighboring Mexican state of Sonora — where abortion is also banned with minimal exceptions. Such stringent abortion restrictions have left organizers scrambling to support women seeking care on both sides of the border.  Para leer en español, haga click aquí“Because we are on the border with the United States, what happens there affects us,” Leticia Burgos Ochoa, an abortion rights activist and former Mexican senator based in Sonora, told NBC News. For women in Sonora seeking safe, legal abortions, going to Arizona was already part of a limited set of options, Ochoa said. “Before, those who had the financial opportunity did not hesitate to go to the United States to have the care that is required,” Ochoa said. “Now, we have more demand for assistance from the United States.” Arizona’s Supreme Court ruled last week that an 1864 law banning most abortions from the moment of conception could be enforced, creating  chaos  that will force women who need abortions to look elsewhere. “I would go to a different state,” a Phoenix woman  told NBC News  outside an abortion clinic days after the ruling. “There’s a way around this, but they’re making it hard. If you can’t go here,  go to California  or Mexico, go somewhere.” A patchwork of restrictions The  growing number of American women  seeking abortion care in Mexico have to navigate a medley of laws that, like the U.S., vary according to Mexico’s different states. In September, Mexico’s Supreme Court  decriminalized abortion  nationwide in a ruling that was embraced as a victory for Latin America’s “green wave” movement. But 20 of the country’s 32 states continue to ban elective abortions in the first trimester. Once Arizona’s law takes effect, abortion will be banned along the majority of the U.S.-Mexico border. Sonora, Chihuahua, Nuevo León and Tamaulipas — four of the six Mexican states that make up its share of the border — also severely restrict the procedure, expanding an  “abortion desert”  that would span thousands of miles in a remote and politicized region.“The communities most impacted are those who are undocumented, those who live in rural communities with very little resources, immigrant communities where language barriers are present for them, low income communities, and individuals who are facing other intersecting issues,” said Eloisa Lopez, executive director of the nonprofit abortion rights group Pro-Choice Arizona.Many U.S. women are crossing the border to access the abortive drug misoprostol, which is sold over-the-counter in most of Mexico to treat stomach ulcers. In Sonora, a sophisticated network of local activists have formed organizations that help get misoprostol to Mexican women — and American women — despite the state’s abortion ban. But activists in Sonora say they’ve seen misinformation and price gouging by pharmacies in Mexican states with stringent abortion restrictions. Andrea Sánchez, an organizer with the Sonora-based abortion advocacy network Aborto Seguro Sonora, said that most pharmacists in the state will require a prescription or overcharge women for the drug on the black market.“We have heard of women who are sold a dose of no more than four misoprostol pills for 5,000 ($300) or 6,000 pesos ($360) and with that dose they generally will not achieve a successful abortion,” Sánchez said. “The serious thing is that women’s vulnerability is being abused, the situation they are going through, but also that they are playing with women’s health.”   A blueprint for cross-border collaborationAfter Texas  implemented a six-week abortion ban in 2021 , activists in Mexican border states began receiving a flurry of calls and messages from American women seeking care on their side of the border. Only one state along the Texas border, Coahuila, allows abortion in the first trimester. Vanessa Jiménez, an activist with the  Necesito Abortar México  network in Nuevo León, another state bordering Texas, said she remembers on June 24, 2022, when Roe v. Wade was overturned, her organization received 70 calls, many from women in the U.S.“There were very frightened women, there were even girls who had their appointments scheduled and had them canceled at that moment,” recalls Jiménez, who said that for decades — before Texas implemented strict abortion restrictions — women protesting for their reproductive rights in Nuevo León shouted slogans like “poor women can’t have an abortion, but rich women can go to Houston.”In Nuevo León, there are only two legal grounds for obtaining an abortion: in the case of rape and when the person's life is in danger if the pregnancy continues.Due to these restrictions, Jiménez and a group of 20 women have focused on guiding and offering recommendations to people who wish to have an abortion using medications such as misoprostol and mifepristone, following the guidelines established by entities such as the World Health Organization and other leading groups.“Apart from American women who write and speak only English, we also get a lot of women who are migrant women who cannot go to a clinic or pay for a trip to New York or California, where abortion is legalized, and who cannot cross into Mexico,” said Jiménez, who has been an abortion activist for more than 15 years. “Most of the women we help in the U.S. we also provide the medication free of charge.”“We help more than 1,000 women per month,” said Jiménez, who estimated that approximately 30% of the counseling offered by her organization is for people from the United States, who contact them through social media or arrive in person.    In addition, seven years ago Jimenez founded a project called La Abortería, which is a space in her home where she helps women who don’t have a place to have a medical abortion. “There is a belief that you need to have a doctor at your side and a nurse, but the  World Health Organization itself  has stated that medical abortion can be performed as an extremely safe procedure,” she explains. In Arizona, Lopez said that women affected by the state’s impending ban will likely seek abortions in California, Nevada or New Mexico before resorting to options in Mexico. Whether Arizona’s ban stands after Election Day remains to be seen.  State organizers say  they have more than enough signatures to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot that would let voters weigh in on whether to create a “fundamental right” to abortion in the state until fetal viability. Dawn Penich, a spokesperson for the nonprofit coalition Arizona for Abortion, said the amendment has gained widespread support and momentum since last week’s ruling.“Appreciation for one’s personal freedoms and liberty is a very Arizona idea,” said Penich, who added that, especially in the state’s rural communities, “the idea of getting the government out of your bedroom, out of your private life and out of your exam room is very popular.” “It’s about having the choice and the ability to make the decision that’s right for you and your family,” she said. Isabela Espadas Barros Leal reported from New York, and Albinson Linares from Mexico City. ",2024-04-16 22:06:00 PM EEST,NBC,"The Mexican state closest to Arizona bans most abortions, setting up a regional void",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/mexican-state-sonora-closest-arizona-bans-abortions-creating-regional-rcna148060
Kaitlin Sullivan,"Whooping cough outbreaks in Europe, Asia and  parts of the U.S.  should be a reminder to get vaccinated, experts say.Since January,  cases of whooping cough  have risen sharply in the U.K. and Europe, the largest surge since 2012.China logged more than 15,000 cases in January of this year, a  15-fold increase  over the same time period last year. This month there have been small clusters of reported cases among high school students in the San Francisco Bay Area and several isolated cases in  Hawaii . From October through earlier this year,  New York City  went through an outbreak, with more than 200 cases of mostly young children. What’s happening?Whooping cough, or Bordetella pertussis — the bacteria that causes the illness — is a   very contagious respiratory illness spread through small respiratory droplets. Due to widespread vaccination, whooping cough is largely under control in the U.S., but breakthrough cases, which are usually mild, do happen in people who are vaccinated.“Some U.S. health departments have informed us of local outbreaks, which we expect to see every year,” Jasmine Reed, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesperson, told NBC News. “So we are not seeing anything unusual.”Cases of whooping cough in the U.S. in 2024 are still lower than normal pre-pandemic levels. The U.S. usually logs around 20,000 cases of whooping cough every year. There were nearly 50,000 cases during a  2012 outbreak , CDC  data shows . Annual cases dropped steeply during the first two years of the pandemic, to 6,100 in 2020 and just 2,100 in 2021. Masking and physical distancing  disrupted the normal cycles  of many respiratory illnesses, including common colds, RSV and flu. “Where the pandemic may have interrupted the normal cycle of pertussis is people were not getting vaccinated on schedule because families weren’t seeing their physicians as frequently as we would like,” said Dr. Thomas Murray, a professor of pediatric infectious disease at the Yale School of Medicine. Warning signs for babiesWhooping cough causes cough seizures, a series of coughs that make it hard for a person to take a breath. “When it finally stops, you take a breath in and it sounds like a ‘whoop,’” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.In adults and kids, whooping cough can look very much like a cold, prompting a runny nose and cough. But in young babies, an infection can be much more serious.Pertussis inflames young babies’ bronchial tubes, or airways, making it difficult to breathe. The most common complication of an infection is pneumonia, which can be fatal. According to the CDC, there were 307 reported deaths from pertussis from 2000 to 2017. Nearly 85% were infants younger than 2 months.“The disease is typically called whooping cough, but the very young babies don’t necessarily cough, they stop breathing,” Murray said, adding that the first thing parents should be aware of is anyone who is sick trying to come visit their newborn. “For babies themselves, any fever over 100.4 degrees is something their pediatrician needs to know about.”If a baby’s lips are turning blue or they appear not to be breathing how they normally would, that “is something to be worried about, especially if they have been around someone who is sick,” Murray said. The CDC recommends babies start their DTaP vaccine series — which can prevent diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis — starting at 2 months old. The series includes four more shots, at 4 and 6 months, 15 to 18 months, and 4 to 6 years old. “The concern is that during the Covid period, a lot of kids were withheld from regular vaccination,” Schaffner said. “Now practitioners are trying to catch up.”DTaP, which is formulated to elicit an immune response in babies, who have a less-developed immune system than kids, is about 98% effective at preventing pertussis in the first year following a five-dose series, according to  the CDC . Teens and adults may need a booster The Tdap vaccine is recommended for kids 11 and older as well as adults who may need a booster. DTaP cannot be given to kids older than 7, but the Tdap booster can be given even to people who never had their initial DTaP series, the CDC advises. “It’s important for all adults to have received a dose of Tdap. Following that, they should get either a Td or Tdap vaccine every 10 years,” Reed, of the CDC, said, noting that vaccination wanes over time.Adult vaccination protects kids from whooping cough, and lessens the disease if the vaccinated person does get sick. However, “our compliance with that is less than optimal, which provides an opportunity for older people to get whooping cough,” Schaffner said.While whooping cough can be dangerous for older adults, the primary concern is an adult passing the bacteria to an unvaccinated newborn baby. “Anyone who comes to see the new baby should have had a recent inoculation with Tdap vaccine, to provide a cocoon of protection around that baby,” Schaffner said.The CDC advises women to get a booster with every pregnancy. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists  recommends  pregnant mothers get vaccinated with Tdap during their third trimester, which the CDC says  prevents  around 78% of pertussis cases and 90% of pertussis hospitalizations in babies younger than 2 months.Is the bacteria mutating? In 2019, researchers at the CDC found the bacteria that causes pertussis — bacterium Bordetella pertussis — has changed over time, which could make the current vaccines  less protective than they once were . “It’s not clear what effect, if any, those changes have on vaccine effectiveness,” Reed said.Schaffner said the vaccines do still offer significant protection and are currently the best method for protection. “It’s not like the flu. It mutates very slowly and these strains are sufficiently related to each other, so the vaccine still works,” he said.The influenza virus mutates rapidly, as does coronavirus, which is why vaccines for those illnesses need to be updated every year. DTaP and Tdap vaccines are not reformulated.The current outbreaks aren’t cause for alarm, but parents of new babies should be aware of the best ways to protect their newborns.“It won’t turn into a pandemic because we have a highly vaccinated population,” Schaffner said. “However, let’s make sure that pregnant people get vaccinated, that babies are vaccinated on schedule, and the rest of us take the Tdap vaccine every 10 years.”",2024-04-17 12:00:00 PM EEST,NBC,Whooping cough rising sharply in some countries.

Reuters,"An investigation of five fur farms in  China  housing foxes, raccoon dogs and mink found a high risk of diseases developing that could jump from animals to humans, said animal protection group  Humane Society International  who conducted the study at the end of 2023.The farms in China’s northern  Hebei  and Liaoning provinces each held between 2,000 and 4,000 animals in intensive conditions, including in close proximity to poultry, HSI said.Alastair MacMillan, a visiting professor at Surrey University’s Veterinary School, said the high stocking density of the animals facilitates the rapid spread of viruses on droplets from one to another, and potentially to humans.“The rapid circulation and mixing of different strains of virus from animal to animal facilitates their adaption to a mammalian host, the development of mutant strains of concern and a greater likelihood of a threat of human infection.”China’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs did not respond to requests for comment regarding the conditions on the fur farms and the risk of disease spread.MacMillan said that from a disease transmission and public health perspective the footage was extremely worrying as it is well known that animals farmed for their fur are susceptible to respiratory viruses that can infect humans.Data from the early days of the  Covid-19 pandemic  briefly uploaded to a database by Chinese scientists last year suggested raccoon dogs may also have been involved in coronavirus reaching humans.Photos and footage from HSI showed animals densely packed in small empty cages with wire mesh floors. Reuters was not able to independently verify the footage.Many animals could be seen pacing up and down repetitively, an action linked to psychological distress, according to veterinary experts.“Mentally disturbed animals, piles of animal filth, barren cages and worrying zoonotic disease is in stark contrast to the glamorous image the fur trade tries to portray,” said Peter Li, HSI’s China policy expert.Even as China’s fur production has fallen in line with global trends, down 50% from 2022 to 2023 and a near 90% decline in the past decade, there appears to be still robust demand for fur.Social media platforms such as e-commerce site Xiaohongshu and  Weibo  showed users discussing wearing fur as desirable and practical for keeping warm. ",2024-04-15 18:25:00 PM EEST,NBC,"High risk of animal-to-human diseases developing in some China fur farms, welfare group says",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/china-fur-farms-diseases-animals-humans-covid-pandemic-coronavirus-rcna147839

For consumers, it can be difficult to keep track of the various recalls issued on popular products — and determine whether any items they bought are affected. The list below rounds up some of the biggest recalls affecting the public right now.Laundry detergent packetsProcter and Gamble, the maker of Tide Pods,  recalled  8.2 million bags of laundry detergent packets April 5 because they may be defective, with a risk of splitting open. If the contents are ingested or touch the skin or eyes, they pose a serious risk of injury. No injuries have been reported, however.According to an  announcement  posted by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the recall applies to Tide Pods, Gain Flings, Ace Pods and Ariel Pods manufactured between September and February. Consumers can contact Procter and Gamble for a refund and a new, child-resistant bag in which to store the pods, as well as a free cabinet lock.“This is a packaging issue not a product quality or safety issue,” a company spokesperson said in a statement. Garment steamersIn an expansion of a recall initiated in  November 2022 , about 1.6 million additional Black+Decker handheld fabric steamers were  recalled April 4,  following reports of burns caused by hot water spewing from the nozzle. According to the CPSC, 82 burns have been linked to the steamers, seven of which were second-degree burns. Consumers should contact Empower Brands for a refund.In an unrelated recall, 2 million handheld fabric steamers were  recalled in February  for the same reason. Those steamers were sold by the brands Steamfast, Vornado and Sharper Image. According to the CPSC, Vornado received at least 23 reports of burns related to the issue.Starbucks mugsNestlé USA  recalled more than 440,000  Starbucks-branded mugs in March, following customer reports of burns and cuts after the products broke or overheated. The recall applies to four types of gift sets containing a ceramic mug with metallic coating, which were sold during the 2023 holiday season. The mugs pose a risk when microwaved or filled with hot liquid.  According to the CPSC , nine cases of severe burns or blisters and one cut have been reported. The mugs were sold online and at Target and Walmart stores between November and January. Customers should return the mugs for a refund or contact Nestlé USA for a check. Trader Joe’s cashewsSome cashews sold at Trader Joe’s were  recalled  March 17 because of potential contamination with salmonella bacteria. The maker, Wenders LLC, initiated the recall, which affects Trader Joe’s “50% Less Sodium Roasted & Salted Whole Cashews.” The issue was identified through routine testing by the Food and Drug Administration. No illnesses have been reported.The nuts were sold at Trader Joe’s stores in 16 states; consumers can return them for a refund.<h2>Yamaha power adapters</h2>Yamaha Corp. of America, best known for manufacturing musical instruments, initiated a  recall of more than 34,000 power adapters  last month because of a risk that the product could shock or electrocute users.According to an announcement posted by the CPSC, the recall applies to Yamaha PA-10 AC power adapters sold between June 2021 and November 2023. A crack between the adapter’s upper and lower cases can expose electrical wiring, though no injuries have been reported.The adapter was sold on its own and in bundles with certain models of Yamaha analog mixing consoles. The company said that consumers should contact Yamaha for a free replacement. <h2>Ground cinnamon</h2>The FDA in March  warned   about  elevated lead levels  in six ground cinnamon products. The list includes La Fiesta, from La Superior SuperMercados; Marcum, from Save A Lot; MK, from SF Supermarket; Swad, from Patel Brothers; Supreme Tradition, from Dollar Tree & Family Dollar; and Eli Chilar, from La Joya Morelense. A Dollar Tree spokesperson said the company had removed affected products from its stores. An FDA spokesperson said that there was no known link to a recall of lead-tainted cinnamon applesauce pouches last year.<h2>Johnsonville Polish kielbasa turkey sausages</h2>A distributor of Johnsonville meat products  has  recall ed  35,430 pounds of Polish kielbasa turkey sausages after consumers reported finding pieces of rubber in the products.  There have been no reports of health issues. In a statement on its website , Johnsonville said it had told retail partners to remove the affected sausages, which have best-by dates of May 2024, from store shelves. <h2>Trader Joe’s soup dumplings</h2>A California manufacturer is  recalling  almost 62,000 pounds of  frozen chicken soup dumplings  sold at Trader Joe’s stores after consumers reported finding hard plastic in the food. The U.S. Agriculture Department said that the dumplings may have been contaminated by a permanent marker pen. No illnesses have been reported. “We voluntarily take action quickly, aggressively investigating potential problems and removing the product from sale if there is any doubt about its safety or quality,” a Trader Joe’s spokesperson said.<h2>Cinnamon applesauce pouches</h2>As of March, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it had received more than 500 reports of confirmed, suspected and probable cases of lead poisoning linked to cinnamon applesauce pouches. The source of the lead contamination is likely cinnamon from  a processor in Ecuador , according to the FDA. The  agency said  that the cinnamon contained lead chromate, a pigment illegally added to spices to increase their weight or enhance their color.Three brands have recalled the children’s snack. WanaBana  pulled its Apple Cinnamon Fruit Puree Pouches  from stores in October, followed by Weis and the supermarket brand Schnucks.<h2>Jeep Grand Cherokees</h2>Chrysler  recalled more than 338,000  Jeep Grand Cherokees because of potentially faulty steering components. The affected models include the 2021-2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee LS and the 2022-2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee.In a  letter  dated Feb. 24 on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website, Chrysler said the steering knuckles and part of the upper control arms — which are supposed to attach together — may separate, which could cause the vehicles to lose control. Chrysler said it is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to the affected models. <h2>Eye ointments</h2>Four types of eye ointments were recalled in February because of concerns that they were manufactured in an unsanitary facility. The products — Equate Lubricant Eye Ointment, Equate Stye Lubricant Eye Ointment, CVS Health Lubricant Eye Ointment and AACE Pharmaceuticals’ Lubricant PM Ointment — were sold nationwide at  Walmart and CVS stores. They have expiration dates from February 2024 to September 2025.Brassica Pharma Pvt. Ltd., the manufacturer, said in  a statement  that the potential contamination could lead to eye infections, though no such issues had been reported as of Feb. 16.The recall is separate from a  cluster of bacterial infections  linked to contaminated eyedrops, which led to the recall of two brands — EzriCare Artificial Tears and Delsam Pharma’s Artificial Tears — last year. The FDA has also warned people not to use 28 additional eyedrop products after investigators found unsanitary conditions in a manufacturing facility.<h2>Certain Volkswagen Group models</h2>Volkswagen Group, which makes Volkswagen and Audi vehicles, among others,  recalled approximately 261,000 vehicles  over potentially faulty fuel tank suction pumps. A  host of models are affected , including some Audi A3, VW Jetta and VW Golf vehicles with model years 2015 to 2020. Volkswagen warned last month that due to issues with a suction jet pump seal, “fuel may flow into a separate evaporative (EVAP) emissions system and possibly leak out of the charcoal canister.” A fuel leak can increase fire risks and potentially damage a vehicle or harm its occupants.<h2>Queso fresco and cotija cheese</h2>The FDA has warned people not to eat dairy products including queso fresco and cotija cheese that were manufactured by Rizo López Foods. The CDC has linked  26 listeria infections  to the products, with cases reported as recently as December. The agencies reopened an investigation in January after new illnesses were reported and a cotija cheese sample tested positive for listeria. Listeria bacteria can cause serious illness; of the people who got infections, 23 were hospitalized and two died.To date,  more than 115 products  made by Rizo López Foods or that contain the manufacturer’s dairy products have been recalled, including taco kits, wraps and meals sold at Albertsons, Costco and Safeway.“We regret the impact this has had on our loyal customers who have had to recall their products containing cheese we supplied to them,” Edwin Rizo, CEO of Rizo López Foods, said in a statement. “We have always aimed to provide safe, high-quality products.”<h2>Gun safes</h2>Four companies have collectively recalled more than 120,000 biometric gun safes sold by Amazon, Walmart and other major retailers. The safes unlock by scanning a part of the owner’s body such as a fingerprint. But the CPSC is aware of 91 reports of unauthorized users opening the safes.  The recall, issued in February, includes safes from the brands  Awesafe ,  Bulldog  and  Machir safes . BBRKIN also  recalled gun safes  sold on Amazon after a report of a 6-year-old boy opening the product.CPSC Chair Alex Hoehn-Saric  told NBC News  that the commission heightened its scrutiny of gun safes after a lawsuit filed in August alleged that a 12-year-old boy died from a firearm obtained from a biometric safe. The CPSC  recalled those safes  in October.Brandon Rutledge, Bulldog’s vice president,  said in a statement  that “the problems have stemmed from people not programming the safes at all, or not programming them properly.”<h2>Toshiba laptop adapters</h2>Dynabook — formerly known as Toshiba —  recalled 15.5 million AC laptop adapters  in February over concerns about burn and fire risks. Information posted to the  CPSC website showed  Dynabook had received 679 reports of the affected adapters overheating, catching fire, melting or burning over a period of more than a decade. This included 43 reports of minor burns.The  recalled products  were included in the purchase of Toshiba laptops and also sold separately, and have date codes from April 2008 to December 2012.<h2>'Gas station heroin'</h2>Two distributors have  recalled Neptune’s Fix supplements  amid reports that the products may cause  seizures, loss of consciousness and death . The supplements contain tianeptine, a substance nicknamed “gas station heroin,” and are sold with false claims of improving brain function and helping with anxiety, depression, pain or opioid use disorder. Tianeptine has not been approved by the FDA for any use.A Jan. 11 letter the agency sent to gas stations, convenience stores and other retailers asked them to stop selling Neptune’s Fix and other tianeptine products. Since then, Neptune Resources, LLC has recalled Neptune’s Fix elixirs and tablets, and Super Chill Products — another distributor — has recalled its elixirs, as well.<h2>Philips breathing machines</h2>Since the medical technology giant Philips recalled some of its breathing machines in 2021, more than 560 deaths have been reported that may be linked to them. The FDA  received  111 reports of deaths from July 1 to Sept. 30, 2023. The recalled machines include certain ventilators, as well as BiPAP and CPAP machines used to treat sleep apnea. The foam used in the machines can break down, leading users to breathe chemicals or foam particles into their airways, the FDA said. Philips announced in January that it would not sell new devices for sleep apnea in the U.S.A Philips representative said the company has not found conclusive data linking the devices to the deaths reported.<h2>Quaker Oats products</h2>More than 60 Quaker products have been  recalled since Dec. 15  because of potential contamination with salmonella bacteria. The  products  include certain flavors of Cap’n Crunch and Oatmeal Squares cereals, some Gatorade protein bars and some batches of Quaker Chewy granola bars and Quaker granola cereals. PepsiCo, Quaker's parent company, said that a facility where the affected products were manufactured will close permanently in June.",2024-03-08 14:00:00 PM EET,NBC,"Recalls have been issued for Tide Pods, Starbucks mugs, Trader Joe's cashews and more — see the latest list",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/recalls-latest-list-products-rcna135878
Katherine Doyle,"Jury selection in Donald Trump’s  hush money trial  Thursday revealed there are certain topics that are likely to capture the former president's attention: Miami, real estate and media.When one New Yorker talked about his decades in law enforcement, Trump raised his eyebrows. The juror, who said he holds Yankees season tickets, added that he reads the New York Post and Daily News. It was as if Trump, who moments earlier let out a yawn, was seized by an electrical current.Later, Trump straightened his back and cocked his chin as a young lawyer, born and raised in Miami, began running through her answers to the jury questionnaire. Asked whether she had been the victim of a crime, the woman said her phone was stolen from her in Paris, and she noted that her family’s car was “incidentally burned in an arson in Italy.”Any reprieve Trump may have hoped for from the woman soon fell away as she talked about reading The Washington Post, a newspaper he has railed against. She said that while she harbors “opinions” about Trump, she is “very comfortable that I can put those aside.” The woman described watching Fox News occasionally “just to try to see what’s going on all sides.”Trump crossed his arms and glared at the space in front of him.Both jurors were later dismissed.At times, Trump craned his neck, particularly when potential jurors who said they didn’t think they could be fair or impartial were exiting the courtroom.That ended up being the fate of a former university administrator who recalled seeing Trump during a time when he was a developer and tabloid fixture, before he was elected president. The juror described once having seen Trump and his former wife Marla Maples “shopping for baby things at ABC Home.” She said she had heard positive things about Trump but added, “How I feel about him as a president is different.”The exchange illustrated the complexities of  sitting a jury  in Democratic-leaning Manhattan, where Trump faces a public largely averse to his behavior and politics.Trump has pleaded not guilty to charges related to falsifying business records to allegedly cover up hush money payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels during the tail end of the 2016 presidential campaign.Mostly, though, Trump appeared ambivalent, staring ahead during voir dire on Thursday. He didn’t follow his legal team in turning around to face the potential jurors seated in the courtroom as they were introduced to the defense.He yawned as the presiding judge, Juan Merchan, reached the end of reading jury instructions.The lengthy process included two jurors’ being dismissed after having been seated.The first, an oncology nurse, said she’d had second thoughts about her ability to be fair or impartial. The other, an IT consultant, returned for questioning and expressed “annoyance” at how much information about him was already public.A social media influencer wrote on Instagram that she was “[p]roud to be amongst” those who asked to be dismissed  because of their strong views  about Trump.Those who weren’t immediately struck ticked through jury questionnaires with answers befitting a densely populated metropolis with some of the highest per capita income levels in the country.An attorney who said she had discussed the case and its legal merits “with many co-workers” was asked whether that would affect her ability to serve as fair and impartial. She responded with a sigh, saying that while she would put her legal training aside, “it is hard to unring a bell.” She wasn’t seated on the jury.Standing feet from Trump, others called him “selfish and self-serving” and described themselves as “allergic” to politics that “gets personal and petty.”A man who said he was born and raised in Italy compared Trump to Silvio Berlusconi, the late prime minister of Italy and infamous womanizer who was convicted of tax fraud in 2013.“It would be a little hard for me to retain my impartiality and fairness,” the man said before he was dismissed.Later, a self-described “Bernie gal” apologized after she was asked to read aloud some of her social media posts attacking Trump during the 2016 campaign, a time when, she said, she was in a “disturbed frame of mind.”“I do not hold those positions today,” she said.“Electoral politics can be pretty spicy, and Mr. Trump can be pretty spicy. And I feel that I owe him an apology for some of my language,” she said, before she also was dismissed.Robert Hirschhorn, a jury consultant at Cathy E. Bennett & Associates, said the process wasn’t unusual, with high-profile cases often drawing heavy scrutiny — including of the jurors themselves.It is “seven steps forward, two steps back,” Hirschhorn said, citing Murphy’s Law.“If it can go wrong, it will go wrong,” he said.Still, he said he expected a fair and impartial jury to be impaneled by the end of jury selection.Merchan swore in the 12-person jury, plus an alternate, on Thursday. He is aiming to sit the five other alternates before the end of Friday.The trial is expected to take as long as eight weeks, with Trump required to attend every day or face penalties.",2024-04-19 04:18:00 AM EEST,NBC,Trump's curiosity with jurors ebbs and flows during final stage of selection process.

Dan De Luce,"Iran’s  missile and drone barrage against Israel  last weekend “turned out to be a spectacular failure,” with nearly all of the projectiles failing to hit Israel, CIA Director William Burns said Thursday.Speaking at an event at the George W. Bush Presidential Center in Dallas, Burns said that the thwarting of the missile and drone assault showed the strength of Israel’s military and that it had “friends” in the world, including the U.S. and other countries that helped, as well.“The Iranians fired off something like 330 drones and missiles combined,” Burns said. “Of those 330 missiles, only four or five actually impacted in Israel, and none of them did any significant damage.“It’s a reminder of the quality of the Israeli military,” he added. “It’s a reminder of the fact that the Israelis have friends starting with the United States, but others, as well.”Follow live updates on Israel’s reported strike on IranPresident Joe Biden and other senior U.S. officials hope tensions may ease slightly in the region but said  Israel was still weighing  how it would respond to Tehran.The Israeli government, “as we sit here this afternoon, is considering a response to what happened last Saturday night,” Burns said.“I think the broad hope of the president and policymakers in the administration is that we’ll find a way to de-escalate the situation,” he said.<h2>Ammunition shortages in Ukraine</h2>Burns, a former career diplomat who was ambassador to Russia, said he had visited Ukraine about a month ago and heard firsthand from Ukrainian military officers about their critical ammunition shortages.Burns said he was in Ukraine just days after Russian forces captured the town of Adiivka in eastern Ukraine.“I talked to one of the senior officers who was there, and he described it in pretty simple terms,” Burns said. “He said, ‘We fought as long and as hard as we could, but the Russians just kept coming, and we ran out of ammunition.’” He said a 2,000-strong Ukrainian brigade in the Adiivka battle tried to fend off Russians with “a grand total” of 15 artillery rounds a day and 42 mortar rounds. “They were overwhelmed, but it wasn’t for lack of bravery or determination on their part,” Burns said. He said he feared there would be more battlefield losses in Ukraine unless Congress approved a long-delayed military aid package.<h2>Sleepless night</h2>Asked what kept him up at night, Burns mentioned the threat of terrorist attacks, the war in Ukraine, the conflict in Gaza and the risks posed to CIA employees around the world. But he also recounted an experience that literally kept him up all night when he agreed to attend a training session for new CIA clandestine officers at the agency’s training ground, known as “The Farm,” near Williamsburg, Virginia.The overnight instructional course, which included members of the Army’s elite Delta Force, featured a training exercise in which CIA colleagues had been taken “hostage.”But no one told the trainees or the Delta Force commandos that the role player posing as a “hostage” for the exercise was Burns himself, who had been tied to a chair for the simulation, he said.“It’s, like, 4:30 in the morning, and this exercise culminates with a hostage rescue mission by Delta group,” Burns said. The Delta Force “major who was commanding it had only been told that there’s this simulated situation where there are some CIA officers with someone impersonating a senior CIA officer. They’ve been captured and they’re held hostage,” Burns said.“So it’s worth the price of admission to see the look on the face of that young major as he came up the stairs in this hostage rescue effort and saw a real live CIA director tied to a chair,” he said.",2024-04-19 05:12:00 AM EEST,NBC,CIA director: Iranian attack on Israel was a 'spectacular failure',https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/cia-director-iranian-attack-israel-was-spectacular-failure-rcna148461

Megan Lebowitz,"U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon on Thursday denied motions by two of former President  Donald Trump 's co-defendants to dismiss charges in the classified documents case. Trump aide Walt Nauta's lawyers asked this month for five charges against him to be dismissed, while lawyers for Carlos De Oliveira, who was the property manager at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s Florida estate, requested that all charges against him be tossed out.In her filing in Florida, Cannon said De Oliveira ""does not meaningfully dispute that the charging document satisfies the minimum pleading standards."" She also noted that his lawyers can challenge prosecutors' evidence during a trial, ""where the Special Counsel will bear the entire burden of proof as to all essential elements of the obstruction offenses.""Similarly, she dismissed the motion from Nauta's lawyers, who had argued that obstruction charges against him were  unconstitutionally vague . Cannon said she was in ""general agreement with the Special Counsel"" that the indictment's allegations ""provide enough of a basis to deny Nauta’s request for dismissal on vagueness grounds.""Both men had also requested bills of particulars, meaning more details about the charges against them and why they are being accused of crimes. Cannon denied those requests, as well.""The Court cannot say that the Indictment as a whole lacks sufficient information to assist Nauta in preparing for trial, and the discovery provided in this case is exceedingly voluminous,"" Cannon said about Nauta's request.Neither Nauta's nor De Oliveira's lawyers immediately responded to requests for comment Thursday evening. Nauta has been a ccused  of helping Trump hide national security files from investigators, and he faces charges including conspiracy to obstruct justice and withholding a document or record.De Oliveira has been a ccused  of trying to delete security video in Mar-a-Lago when the Justice Department sought it. He faces charges including conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements.Nauta and De Oliveira have pleaded not guilty.

Berkeley Lovelace Jr.,"Eli Lilly’s weight loss drug  Zepbound  was found to reduce obstructive sleep apnea in adults with obesity, the drugmaker said in a release Wednesday.Obstructive sleep apnea affects about 39 million adults in the U.S., according to  the National Council on Aging . It occurs when a person’s upper airway becomes blocked during sleep, cutting off airflow throughout the night, the  National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute  says. Obesity, which can narrow the airway, can increase a person's risk.Left untreated, sleep apnea can lead to heart arrhythmias, heart failure and death.Lilly’s results were based on two studies of adults with obesity and moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea. The findings were announced in a news release and have not been published in a medical journal or reviewed by outside scientists.The researchers looked at whether  Zepbound  worked better than a placebo in reducing how many times per hour, on average, a person partly or fully stopped breathing during sleep.In the first study, participants did not use PAP, or positive airway pressure, machines, which gently blow air into the airway to keep it from collapsing. People in the second study used PAP machines.The researchers found that after 52 weeks, Zepbound had led to an average reduction of 27.4 events per hour in people who were not on PAP machines, compared to a reduction of 4.8 events per hour for people on the placebo.In people who did use PAP machines, Zepbound led to an average reduction of 30.4 events per hour, compared to an average reduction of 6 events per hour for the placebo group. In both trials, people on Zepbound lost, on average, around 20% of their body weight, which Lilly suspects contributed to the reduction in sleep apnea events. ""Tirzepatide has the potential to be the first pharmaceutical treatment for the underlying disease,"" Dr. Jeff Emmick, Lilly's senior vice president for product development, said in the release.Dr. Susan Spratt, an endocrinologist and the senior medical director of the Population Health Management Office at Duke Health in North Carolina, who was not involved in the studies, applauded the research, saying the findings show that obesity “is not a vanity issue.”“This is about treating a major health problem that reduces significant morbidity and mortality,” she said.She said the findings could make insurance companies  less reluctant to provide coverage  for the weight loss drug.Last month, Medicare said it would  cover  Wegovy for  certain patients  after it was found to reduce heart disease risk.Lilly said it plans to share additional details of the results of the studies at the American Diabetes Association conference in June.It plans to submit the results to the Food and Drug Administration sometime mid-year.",2024-04-17 13:15:00 PM EEST,NBC,"Eli Lilly's weight loss drug Zepbound found to reduce sleep apnea, company says",https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/eli-lillys-weight-loss-drug-zepbound-found-reduce-sleep-apnea-company-rcna148113
Kalhan Rosenblatt,"Instagram said it plans to test a new feature   in an effort to curb sextortion on its platform.The “nudity protection” feature, which has several functions,   is designed to help prevent users from receiving unwanted sexual images and encourage “people to think twice before sending nude images,” according to a  blog post  the platform published Thursday.The feature, which will automatically be turned on for users under age 18, will blur images that are detected as containing nudity. There will also be a warning that reads, “Photo may contain nudity.”Additionally, the platform said it will push a message to users “reminding them to be cautious when sending sensitive photos, and that they can unsend these photos if they’ve changed their mind.” They will also be directed to  Meta’s Safety Center  and  support helplines . ""These updates build on our longstanding work to help protect young people from unwanted or potentially harmful contact,"" Instagram said in the blog post. ""We default teens into stricter message settings so they can’t be messaged by anyone they’re not already connected to, show Safety Notices to teens who are already in contact with potential scam accounts, and offer a dedicated option for people to report DMs that are threatening to share private images.""The platform's announcement comes as  efforts to regulate social media continue to ramp up  across the U.S. amid concerns from some that the platforms don’t do enough to keep kids safe online.Last month, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican,  signed a bill  that bans children under 14 from having social media accounts. The law is expected to face legal challenges over claims that it violates the First Amendment.In December,  more than 200 organizations sent a letter  urging Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to schedule a vote on the Kids Online Safety Act, or KOSA, which seeks to create liability, or a “duty of care,” for apps and online platforms that recommend content to minors that can negatively affect their mental health.In January,  lawmakers grilled CEOs  from TikTok, X and Meta about online child safety. The tech executives reaffirmed their commitment to child safety and pointed to various tools they offer as examples of how they are proactive about preventing exploitation online.Instagram said in its blog post that it has spent years working with experts ""to understand the tactics scammers use to find and extort victims online, so we can develop effective ways to help stop them.""Sameer Hinduja, co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center and faculty associate at the Berkman Klein Center at Harvard University, was among the experts who applauded Instagram's efforts.The new feature   will reduce ""unwanted exposure to potentially traumatic images, gently introduces cognitive dissonance to those who may be open to sharing nudes, and educates people about the potential downsides involved,"" Hinduja said in a statement in Instagram's blog post.Instagram said it also supported the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in developing  Take It Down , a service that helps to remove nude or partially nude images of minors online. The service is among the resources that users under 18 will be referred to by Instagram. Users older than 18 will be directed to the website  Stop Non-Consensual Intimate Image Abuse , which is operated by the  Revenge Porn Helpline .Instagram emphasized that it already takes ""severe action"" when it becomes ""aware of people engaging in sextortion."" In January, the platform also announced  stricter messaging defaults for teens under 16 .""Now, we won’t show the 'Message' button on a teen’s profile to potential sextortion accounts, even if they’re already connected,"" the platform said Thursday. ""We’re also testing hiding teens from these accounts in people’s follower, following and like lists, and making it harder for them to find teen accounts in Search results.""A spokesperson for Meta, which owns Instagram, told NBC News that the new features will start testing in the coming weeks and roll out globally in the coming months.",2024-04-11 23:17:00 PM EEST,NBC,Instagram to test blurring nudity in messages to protect teens from sextortion,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/instagram-testing-blurring-nudity-messages-protect-teens-sextortion-rcna147402
"Berkeley Lovelace Jr.,Christine Romans,Jessica Herzberg","Despite Eli Lilly’s assurances about an ample supply of its new weight loss drug  Zepbound , the company is now facing widespread shortages just months after its approval. While the drugmaker is working to resolve the issue, a quick fix is unlikely, it says, with no immediate end to the shortage in sight.The Food and Drug Administration  approved Zepbound  in November, introducing a new competitor to Novo Nordisk’s  blockbuster weight loss drug Wegovy . Zepbound officially went into shortage in April, according to the FDA, mere months after Lilly CEO Dave Ricks  told NBC News  that supply of the drug was not a concern. As of Wednesday, all but one dosage was listed as in “limited availability” through the end of June on  the FDA’s website .Lilly is blaming the shortage on the huge demand for the drug, saying it can’t produce enough to meet everyone’s needs for diabetes and for weight loss.  Zepbound  is the same drug as the company’s diabetes medication Mounjaro, but rebranded for weight loss. Both contain the active ingredient tirzepatide.Like Zepbound, all but one dosage of Mounjaro is in shortage, according to the FDA. “For the near term, we are going to be in this limited availability, which may cause delays across some of the doses for both Mounjaro and Zepbound,” said Rhonda Pacheco, Lilly’s group vice president for diabetes and obesity. “We are working so hard every day to make sure that we increase that capacity as fast as we can to get these medications in patients’ hands.”It’s unclear when exactly that will be.To increase supply, Lilly said it plans to open a new manufacturing facility in Concord, North Carolina, by the end of the year, dedicated to making  Zepbound and Mounjaro , as well as a similar diabetes drug called Trulicity. The company declined to share specifics on how much of the medication it expects it will be able to produce. Edgardo Hernandez, who heads global manufacturing at Lilly, said patients can expect to see products from the plant on pharmacy shelves “sometime next year.”‘Immensely disruptive’The shortage means people like Amanda Cella, a 37-year-old South Jersey resident, have to scramble to find a pharmacy that still has the drug in stock.Cella was prescribed Zepbound in February. She may not be able to fill her prescription this month, however.She’s contacted mom-and-pop shops, as well as retail and hospital pharmacies in New Jersey and Philadelphia, but none had the drug.“I wish I were exaggerating when I say I called every Walmart pharmacy in the state of New Jersey,” she said.The drug appears to be available on Lilly’s telehealth platform LillyDirect, Cella said, but it’s on backorder and she doesn’t know when it’ll ship. She said she has enough doses to cover a few more weeks, but if she can’t find more, she’ll consider getting the drug from a  compound pharmacy , which can come with risks like incorrect dosing or contamination.“It’s very frustrating,” Cella said.Dr. Christopher McGowan, a gastroenterologist who runs a weight loss clinic in Cary, North Carolina, said that patients who miss more than two weeks of a weight loss drug may be forced to start their treatment over again at the lowest dose and then gradually increase over several weeks, in order to  reacclimate to the side effects .Starting over can be “immensely disruptive” and “demoralizing” for patients who have successfully lost weight on the drugs, he said. “For one, it is stressful for the patient, who may have to scramble and hunt for a pharmacy that stocks their dose,” he said. “Likewise, it’s time-consuming for clinicians and medical teams to assist.”What’s more, abruptly stopping a weight loss drug could put patients  at risk of weight gain , McGowan said. “Many patients will report a rise in hunger after missing only one or two doses of medication,” he said.Debbie Foley, 56, of Los Angeles, said her hunger levels have gone up since she’s had to lower her dosage of Mounjaro over the past two months, unable to fill her usual prescription. She’s been taking the drug for both diabetes and weight loss.“It’s been a great drug,” Foley said. “I know that people know that and that’s why everybody wants it, but hate when they just say, ‘Well, we just can’t manufacture it fast enough.’ Like, what’s the deal?”‘Be prepared’Lilly has opted to continue to allow new patients to start on Zepbound, rather than attempting to limit the supply to current users, something that  Novo Nordisk did last year  at the height of Wegovy’s shortage by restricting the supply of the lowest dose. Limiting this so-called starter dose meant that many new patients could not start treatment with Wegovy.“We believe that decision is one between a patient and their health care provider,” Pacheco said. “I always say: Be aware and be prepared,” she said. “When you get put on a treatment like Mounjaro or Zepbound, really making sure that you’re aware of the limited availability.” Lilly has a  website  where patients can track supply of the drug. Still, some doctors have had to switch patients to different drugs because of the shortage.Dr. Scott Butsch, director of obesity medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, has had patients who couldn’t find Zepbound switch to other weight loss medications, like Wegovy.There are no strict guidelines for switching between Zepbound and Wegovy, or vice versa, said Butsch, who is currently a principal investigator on a clinical trial for a different Lilly weight loss drug.  Some doctors may have their patient taper off of one medication; others may immediately start them on the new drug, he said. That decision is typically left to the discretion of the doctor.“Some people felt different. Some people had a decrease in side effects. Other people didn’t feel as well. What we know from switching back and forth is it depends on the person,” he said.McGowan, who runs the weight loss clinic in North Carolina, switched one of his patients, 38-year-old Kathryn Davies, from Wegovy to Zepbound late last year. Davies said she had limited success with Wegovy, but Zepbound worked much better. Then last month, her pharmacy ran out of the drug and told her it didn’t know when it would get it back in stock. “It’s definitely a bit of a panic moment,” she said. “I’ve struggled for 30 years before I found a solution that really felt like a cure, as long as I kept taking it. So it’s sort of disorienting.” ",2024-04-18 14:00:00 PM EEST,NBC,"As Zepbound shortage grows, Eli Lilly says no immediate end is in sight",https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/zepbound-shortage-eli-lilly-weight-loss-drug-rcna148232

But, as of Thursday, several videos featuring Swift's songs had the audio restored — including videos previously muted on Swift's own account.A representative for Swift did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Neither TikTok nor UMG responded to requests for comment regarding some of the artist's songs returning.Songs from other popular UMG artists, such as Drake and Olivia Rodrigo, appeared to still be unavailable as of Thursday afternoon. Some videos on Swift's account featuring other UMG artists, like Chamillionaire's ""Ridin',"" are also still silent.UMG, known as one of the “Big Three” global music companies, cleared its music from TikTok in late January, saying it was doing so because of a lack of compensation for artists and songwriters.The Dutch-American company's licensed artists include The Beatles, Elton John, Bob Dylan, U2, Ariana Grande, SZA, Billie Eilish, Adele, Coldplay and many more.""TikTok proposed paying our artists and songwriters at a rate that is a fraction of the rate that similarly situated major social platforms pay,"" UMG said in a statement at the time.TikTok fired back at UMG, accusing the company of putting ""their own greed above the interests of artists and songwriters.""TikTok has an estimated 1.5 billion monthly users, who utilize music on the platform to enhance their videos.

Arturo Conde,"Fans will recognize him from the reboot of “Magnum P.I.,” a crime action TV series about a former Navy SEAL who solves cases in Hawaii. Starting Friday, actor Jay Hernandez can be seen on the big screen in  “The Long Game,”  an underdog sports movie about a Mexican American golf team who wins the Texas high school championship in 1957.In the film also starring Dennis Quaid and Cheech Marin, Hernandez plays J.B. Peña, a Mexican American war veteran and school district superintendent who's rejected from membership at the San Felipe Country Club in Del Rio, Texas, because of his ethnicity, but who goes on to form a high school golf team, the Mustangs, for the Mexican American teens who fell in love with the sport while caddying at the club.  The Mexican American golf team  went on to win the high school championship .“For my character particularly, he feels that's (the golf club) his destination of acceptance. ... It’s an aspirational thing for him,” Hernandez said in an interview. “He served in the military, that wasn’t enough. He’s essentially living the American dream, that’s still not enough,” Hernandez said about Peña. “He just feels like there’s this moving goal post.”“The Long Game,” directed by Julio Quintana and adapted from Humberto G. Garcia’s novel “Mustang Miracle,” tells the  true story of the five Mexican American golfers  from San Felipe High School who became state champions in spite of segregation. “Mexican Americans in the 1950s occupied no better stature in American society than did African Americans,” Garcia wrote in the book. “We were not allowed in many restaurants, hotels, and other service establishments. In fact, we were not even allowed to enter the many buildings we helped build. Mexican Americans were certainly not allowed to join country clubs and partake of the game of golf as members.”Hernandez, who's also one of the executive producers of “The Long Game,” said the story is important because it shows viewers that there are many types of Americans.""We’re American and the American story is also an immigrant story. It’s also a Mexican American story. It’s also a Puerto Rican story. It’s also a Chinese American story. That’s the beauty of this country,"" he said. Off camera, Hernandez, who was born in Los Angeles, says identity is something he is trying to understand.“I have obviously a natural affinity to the United States. I love this country. I grew up with my dad flying the American flag on our porch since I was a young kid,” he said.But, he added, part of his family’s cultural background — specifically on his father’s side — is also from Mexico. And this has shaped his roles in front of the camera.‘They don’t get the acknowledgment’  “I played cops and soldiers and done so many of those types of characters. My personal connection is that my grandfather served in World War II. And he was probably one of those people whose stories don’t really get told,” Hernandez said. “They don’t get the acknowledgment that they deserve in terms of Mexican Americans serving the armed forces.”Putting a spotlight on those overlooked stories motivated Hernandez to work on this movie.“It’s not always border stories and criminals. There’s a whole other world of stories that need to be told, be it astronauts, or golfers, or just people transcending their environment,” he said.Ultimately, Hernandez said, “The Long Game” is a story about trying to fit in.He described a scene from the movie where the young golfers go to Mexico. As Mexican Americans they’re not recognized there as full Mexicans. But in the U.S., they are not seen as full Americans either.""They’re not accepted as full people,"" Hernandez said. ""They’re the other in the story.""For more from NBC Latino,  sign up for our weekly newsletter .",2024-04-12 12:30:00 PM EEST,NBC,Racism kept these Mexican Americans from a Texas golf club.

Daysia Tolentino,"Raquel Lee Bolleau, who shared her experiences working on “The Amanda Show” as a child actor in “Quiet on Set,” said she is “done” with the entertainment industry after her recent experience with the docuseries.In a TikTok video posted Wednesday, Bolleau expressed her frustration with  the Investigation Discovery series , which featured interviews with several actors and former child stars who alleged abuse, inappropriate behavior and a toxic work environment when they appeared on some Nickelodeon shows Dan Schneider produced in the 2000s and the 2010s. Following the docuseries' release last month, Schneider  apologized  for some of his past behavior and the on-set atmosphere.Bolleau said the “Quiet on Set” producers did not invite her to join a panel discussion with other former Nickelodeon stars for the show’s fifth episode, which aired Sunday. Representatives for Bolleau and Investigation Discovery did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Maxine Productions, which produced “Quiet on Set,” and its parent company, Sony Pictures Entertainment, also did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The “Quiet on Set” producers “did the same thing that the industry always does,” Bolleau says in the video, which had amassed over 300,000 views as of Thursday afternoon. “They get what they want from you and then they’re done.”Journalist Soledad O’Brien interviewed the actors who appeared in the episode. She asked them about various issues that were brought up in the docuseries, as well as their thoughts about what the entertainment industry can improve on.  While Bolleau was not part of the group that was interviewed, the final episode included a previously unaired clip of her  describing an alleged incident  on set of “The Amanda Show."" She said she was ""infuriated"" after she was repeatedly spit on by Amanda Bynes during a sketch. She said she was told to ""keep your cool"" and try not to make the incident a problem.A spokesperson for Bynes declined to comment on Thursday.O’Brien showed the clip of Bolleau to “All That” actor Bryan Hearne and his mother, Tracey Brown, during a discussion about racism and representation on set. Hearne said that he was unaware of the incident Bolleau recounted and that he had had only “one solid conversation” with her. However, he said, hearing Bolleau’s experience “hit me really hard.” His mother, Brown, called the incident ""racist.""In his response to the docuseries’ release, Schneider said that “diversity has always been very important” to him.Hearne and Brown did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Bolleau said producers informed her that the clip of her would be shown Sunday, the day the episode dropped. She said she wished she had been able to be part of the discussion with others.“You want me to share my story, but you don’t want to involve me in the actual narrative of change,” Bolleau said. She also claimed that the documentary’s producers did not tell her the premise of the series when they reached out to her. “First of all, you don’t even tell me what type of documentary that I’m going to be a part of,” she said. “You never questioned whether or not this is going to be triggering for me.”It has been “very, very difficult” for Bolleau to face the traumatic experiences that happened to her when she was a young actor, she said. “I can’t do it anymore,” she said at the end of the TikTok video. “I’ve given it all I can. I don’t have nothing else. The show, I don’t want to talk about it. I’m going to get back to my family, my businesses; that’s what I’m focused on. Because this industry? Y’all can have it.”  She posted the video days after former “Double Dare” host Marc Summers also said  he was misled  about the docuseries’ premise. Summers  appeared on Elvis Duran’s program “The Elvis Duran Show”  to promote his off-Broadway show “The Life and Slimes of Marc Summers,” which tells his life story, including his time at Nickelodeon.In the interview, Summers said the docuseries producers “did a bait and switch” on him. “They ambushed me,” he said. “They never told me what this documentary was really about.”Summers said he left the “Quiet on Set” interview after producers showed him a video and explained the premise of the series. It was not clear from the interview or from the docuseries what clip he was shown.Mary Robertson and Emma Schwartz, who directed the series, previously responded to Summers' comments in a joint statement provided by Investigation Discovery. “We are clear with each participant about the nature of our projects,"" they said.",2024-04-12 01:42:00 AM EEST,NBC,Former Nickelodeon star featured in 'Quiet on Set' says she's 'done' with the entertainment industry,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/raquel-lee-bolleau-quiet-on-set-docuseries-response-rcna147404

Nicole Acevedo,"Hits by two late Latin music icons whose ballads and salsa songs are constants in playlists across generations have been inducted into the National Recording Registry at the Library of Congress.Juan Gabriel's ""Amor Eterno"" (""Eternal Love"") and Héctor Lavoe's ""El Cantante"" (""The Singer"") are among the  25 recordings and albums selected Tuesday  for preservation at the nation’s audio history library.Released in 1990, Gabriel wrote the heart-rending ballad ""Amor Eterno"" in memory of his deceased mother. The song has since become a staple for many Latino families, touching the hearts of one and all — young, old, working class, upper class, urban and rural.Regarded as “El Divo de Juárez,” Gabriel began his career in Mexico in the 1970s and rose to stardom in the 1990s.  He died in 2016 at age 66 .The iconic Mexican singing-songwriting superstar is known for his fierce and forceful delivery, making audiences want to sing every one of his songs from the top of their lungs, as well as his sweet voice effectively pulling at everyone's heartstrings.For many in LGBTQ communities , Gabriel's flashy onstage personality and exuberant sense of style helped break down social norms, strict gender roles and machismo.  Iván Gabriel Aguilera, the singer's son, said his father always wanted future generations to relate to his music.""He would always say that 'as long as the public, the people, keep singing my music, Juan Gabriel will never die,'"" Aguilera said in Spanish. ""It’s nice to see that is happening here.""""He’s going to be immortalized there in the Library of Congress,"" Aguilera added.As Gabriel was jumpstarting his career in Mexico in the 1970s, Lavoe  had established himself as one of the greatest salsa music performers in New York City, later becoming known by salsa lovers everywhere as one of the genre's greats. Released in 1978, ""El Cantante"" not only became Lavoe's signature song: It also became emblematic of the new era of salsa music being ushered in by Fania Records.Written and produced by fellow Fania Records alums and salsa icons Rubén Blades and Willie Colón, “El Cantante” narrates the livelihood, struggles and adversities singers face. It also describes how they must interact positively with the audience when oftentimes they are their only supporters.Born in Puerto Rico and raised in the mainland U.S., Lavoe worked as a singer and trombonist with fellow  Fania Records great Johnny Pacheco  and his orchestra. He joined forces with Colón in 1966, creating one of the most important salsa bands that helped reshape the Latin music industry at the time. One of their hits, “Mi Gente” (“My People”), written by Pacheco, is regarded today by many Latinos as an anthem of Hispanic pride.Lavoe died in 1993 at age 46.Both ""Amor Eterno"" and ""El Cantante"" are among the dozens of Latin songs nominated to be added to the registry by Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus as part of a larger effort to increase the recognition of Latino contributions to American history and culture.Every year for the past 18 years, the Library of Congress has selected 25 recordings for preservation at the National Recording Registry, with  works by Latino musicians  currently representing less than 5% of inducted titles, according to Castro's office.Castro has received hundreds of suggestions from the public for congressional nominations to the National Recording Registry over the past two years, submitting nearly 70 titles of Latin songs for consideration, including Gabriel’s “Amor Eterno” and Lavoe’s “El Cantante” as well as Irene Cara’s “Flashdance…What a Feeling” and Daddy Yankee’s “Gasolina,”  which were inducted last year .All of these songs have helped bring the number of titles on the registry to 650, representing a small portion of the national library’s vast recorded sound collection of nearly 4 million items, according to the Library of Congress.For more from NBC Latino,  sign up for our weekly newsletter .",2024-04-16 20:30:00 PM EEST,NBC,Hits by Latin music greats Juan Gabriel and Héctor Lavoe added to National Recording Registry,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/juan-gabriel-hector-lavoe-national-recording-registry-cantante-eterno-rcna147991

But the quartet reunited in the  desert for an electric, nostalgic set.“I didn’t think this was really going to happen,” Stefani told the crowd at one point, according to social media footage posted by users. “Did you?”During the song “Bathwater,” singer Olivia Rodrigo surprised the crowd by joining the band onstage.Blur was a bustDamon Albarn, best known for his band Gorillaz, performed at Coachella with his band Blur — but was met with a lukewarm reception, according to reports and social media footage from the event. Some songs, in which Albarn attempted to get the crowd to sing along, were met with silence from the audience. At one point Albarn told the crowd that they should sing along because “you’ll never see us again.”Swift and Kelce  dance  in the desert Typically, Swift is singing on the world’s biggest stage while her boyfriend, Kelce, is on the field playing for the Kansas City Chiefs. But at Coachella, the couple were spotted  in the crowd , singing along and dancing as they watched the set for Bleachers, the band of Swift’s frequent collaborator Jack Antonoff. They were also seen enjoying a performance from rapper Ice Spice, whom Swift featured on her song “Karma.”Fans shared pictures of them all weekend on social media.Grimes apologizes for a disastrous setDuring her set, Grimes experienced significant technical malfunctions. While the first part of her set appeared to go as planned, the second half was riddled with issues, eventually leading Grimes to scream into the microphone in frustration. She later posted on X , apologizing for the mishap and saying that her set for weekend two will be “flawless.”Kesha changes the lyrics of 'TiK ToK'Kesha made a guest appearance during Reneé Rapp’s set. While the pair performed Kesha’s “TiK ToK,” the singer changed the opening lyrics from “Wake up in the morning feeling like P. Diddy” to “Wake up in the morning like, ‘F--- P. Diddy.’” Both Rapp and Kesha held up their middle fingers during the line. Since November,  Sean “Diddy” Combs  has been hit with five lawsuits in New York accusing him of sexual assault, sexual trafficking and engaging in other criminal activity. Combs has denied all of the allegations, calling them sickening.Coach-EARLE-aIt wouldn’t be Coachella without influencers abound.The soda brand Poppi leaned in by tapping the TikTok “It Girl” Alix Earle.

Those opposed to Israel’s presence had also vowed to protest on-site.Italy’s culture minister had firmly backed Israel’s participation, and the fair was opening amid unusually heightened security.Written in English, the announcement Tuesday of Israel’s delayed opening read: “The artist and curators of the Israeli pavilion will open the exhibition when a ceasefire and hostage release agreement is reached.” Two Italian soldiers stood guard nearby.Adriano Pedrosa, the Brazilian curator of the main show at the Biennale, praised the gesture.“It’s a very courageous decision,” Pedrosa told The Associated Press. “I think it’s a very wise decision as well” because it is “very difficult to present a work in this particular context.”The national pavilions at Venice are independent of the main show, and each nation decides its own show, which may or may not play into the curator’s vision.Palestinian artists are participating in collateral events in Venice and three Palestinian artists’ works are to appear in Pedrosa’s main show, titled “Stranieri Ovunque — Foreigners Everywhere,” which has a preponderance of artists from the global south.Pedrosa, the artistic director of Brazil’s Sao Paulo Museum of Art, said one of the Palestinian artists, New York-based Khaled Jarrar, was not physically in Venice because he couldn’t get a visa.Geopolitics is no stranger to the Biennale. The festival discouraged, and then banned, South Africa’s participation during apartheid. Russian artists withdrew their participation in 2022 to protest the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine, and the Biennale said Russia did not request to participate in this year’s edition.The war in Gaza erupted after Hamas and Islamic Jihad carried out a cross-border attack on Oct. 7 that killed 1,200 people in Israel and kidnapped 250 others.Israel’s retaliatory offensive in Gaza has so far killed over 33,700 Palestinians, according to local health officials, causing widespread devastation. The United Nations has warned of imminent famine in northern Gaza.",2024-04-16 14:04:00 PM EEST,NBC,"Artist refuses to open Israeli pavilion at Venice Biennale until Gaza cease-fire, hostage release",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/venice-biennale-artist-israel-gaza-cease-fire-hostages-rcna147970
Variety,"Giancarlo Esposito  appeared on a recent episode of  SiriusXM’s “Jim & Sam”  show while promoting his new AMC drama series “Parish” and revealed that he was so broke prior to landing his iconic role of Gus Fring on  “Breaking Bad”  that he once considered arranging his own murder so that his children could have some financial protection courtesy of his life insurance money. The actor considered this around 2008, a year before “Breaking Bad” inextricably changed his career and opened the door for roles in “The Mandalorian,” “The Boys” and more.Asked how he got out of near bankruptcy around 2008, Esposito said, “My way out in my brain was: ‘Hey, do you get life insurance if someone commits suicide? Do they get the bread?’ My wife had no idea why I was asking this stuff. I started scheming. If I got somebody to knock me off, death by misadventure, [my kids] would get the insurance. I had four kids. I wanted them to have a life. It was a hard moment in time. I literally thought of self-annihilation so they could survive. That’s how low I was.”“That was the first inkling that there was a way out, but I wouldn’t be here to be available to my kids,” Esposito added. “Then I started to think that’s not viable because the pain I would cause them would be lifelong, and there’d be lifelong trauma that would just extend the generational trauma I’m trying to move away from. The light at the end of the tunnel was ‘Breaking Bad.’”Esposito appeared as Gus Fring on 26 episodes of “Breaking Bad,” then reprised the role on the prequel series “Better Call Saul” for 34 episodes. He told  British GQ  earlier this year that he is highly interested in playing Gus for a third time in a prequel series about the villain.“Yeah, I would love that,” he said. “My backstory is he was a military guy who worked his way up through the ranks and could have become president, even possibly the dictator and have taken over. But he wanted to do something that could not be controlled by others, and he wanted to control his own destiny. And so he took off to create a new life for himself in America and become a meth dealer, a businessman.”“I think, in his younger years, he was someone who could have been more Tony Montana,” Esposito continued. “But he worked his way into becoming level enough to listen, hear, and see through his emotional state. We would hope that it might be ‘The Rise of Gus.’”",2024-04-19 16:52:00 PM EEST,NBC,"Before 'Breaking Bad,' Giancarlo Esposito considered arranging his own murder for insurance money",https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/breaking-bad-giancarlo-esposito-considered-arranging-murder-insurance-rcna148542
The Associated Press,"If you’re feeling — YAWN — sleepy or tired while you read this and wish you could get some more shut-eye, you’re not alone. A majority of Americans say they would feel better if they could have  more sleep , according to a new poll.But in the U.S., the ethos of grinding and pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps is ubiquitous, both in the country’s beginnings and our current environment of always-on technology and work hours. And getting enough sleep can seem like a dream.The  Gallup poll , released Monday, found 57% of Americans say they would feel better if they could get more sleep, while only 42% say they are getting as much sleep as they need. That’s a first in Gallup polling since 2001; in 2013, when Americans were last asked, it was just about the reverse — 56% saying they got the needed sleep and 43% saying they didn’t.Younger women, under the age of 50, were especially likely to report they aren’t getting enough rest.The poll also asked respondents to report how many hours of sleep they usually get per night: Only 26% said they got eight or more hours, which is  around the amount  that sleep experts say is recommended for health and mental well-being. Just over half, 53%, reported getting six to seven hours. And 20% said they got  five hours or less , a jump from the 14% who reported getting the least amount of sleep in 2013.(And just to make you feel even more tired, in 1942, the vast majority of Americans were sleeping more. Some 59% said they slept eight or more hours, while 33% said they slept six to seven hours. What even IS that?)<h2>The reasons aren't exactly clear</h2>The poll doesn’t get into reasons WHY Americans aren’t getting the sleep they need, and since Gallup last asked the question in 2013, there’s no data breaking down the particular impact of the last four years and the  pandemic era .But what’s notable, says Sarah Fioroni, senior researcher at Gallup, is the shift in the last decade toward more Americans thinking they would  benefit from more sleep  and particularly the jump in the number of those saying they get five or less hours.“That five hours or less category ... was almost not really heard of in 1942,” Fioroni said. “There’s almost nobody that said they slept five hours or less.”In modern American life, there also has been “this pervasive belief about how sleep was unnecessary — that it was this period of inactivity where little to nothing was actually happening and that took up time that could have been better used,” said Joseph Dzierzewski, vice president for research and scientific affairs at the National Sleep Foundation.It’s only relatively recently that the importance of sleep to physical, mental and emotional health has started to percolate more in the general population, he said.And there’s still a long way to go. For some Americans, like Justine Broughal, 31, a self-employed event planner with two small children, there simply aren’t enough hours in the day. So even though she recognizes the importance of sleep, it often comes in below other priorities like her 4-month-old son, who still wakes up throughout the night, or her 3-year-old daughter.“I really treasure being able to spend time with (my children),” Broughal says. “Part of the benefit of being self-employed is that I get a more flexible schedule, but it’s definitely often at the expense of my own care.”<h2>There's a cultural backdrop to all this, too</h2>So why are we awake all the time? One likely reason for Americans’ sleeplessness is cultural — a longstanding emphasis on industriousness and productivity.Some of the context is much older than the shift documented in the poll. It includes the Protestants from European countries who colonized the country, said Claude Fischer, a professor of sociology at the graduate school of the University of California Berkeley. Their belief system included the idea that working hard and being rewarded with success was evidence of divine favor.“It has been a core part of American culture for centuries,” he said. “You could make the argument that it ... in the secularized form over the centuries becomes just a general principle that the morally correct person is somebody who doesn’t waste their time.”Jennifer Sherman has seen that in action. In her research in rural American communities over the years, the sociology professor at Washington State University says a common theme among people she interviewed was the importance of having a solid work ethic. That applied not only to paid labor but unpaid labor as well, like making sure the house was clean.A through line of American cultural mythology is the idea of being “individually responsible for creating our own destinies,” she said. “And that does suggest that if you’re wasting too much of your time ... that you are responsible for your own failure.”“The other side of the coin is a massive amount of disdain for people considered lazy,” she added.Broughal says she thinks that as parents, her generation is able to let go of some of those expectations. “I prioritize ... spending time with my kids, over keeping my house pristine,” she said.But with two little ones to care for, she said, making peace with a messier house doesn’t mean more time to rest: “We’re spending family time until, you know, (my 3-year-old) goes to bed at eight and then we’re resetting the house, right?”<h2>The tradeoffs of more sleep</h2>While the poll only shows a broad shift over the past decade,  living through the Covid-19 pandemic  may have affected people’s sleep patterns. Also discussed in post-Covid life is  “revenge bedtime procrastination,”  in which people put off sleeping and instead scroll on social media or binge a show as a way of trying to handle stress.Liz Meshel is familiar with that. The 30-year-old American is temporarily living in Bulgaria on a research grant, but also works a part-time job on U.S. hours to make ends meet.On the nights when her work schedule stretches to 10 p.m., Meshel finds herself in a “revenge procrastination” cycle. She wants some time to herself to decompress before going to sleep and ends up sacrificing sleeping hours to make it happen.“That’s applies to bedtime as well, where I’m like, ’Well, I didn’t have any me time during the day, and it is now 10 p.m., so I am going to feel totally fine and justified watching X number of episodes of TV, spending this much time on Instagram, as my way to decompress,” she said. “Which obviously will always make the problem worse.”",2024-04-15 19:14:00 PM EEST,NBC,"Are Americans feeling like they get enough sleep?

The Associated Press,"PHOENIX — An Arizona woman who accused former major league pitcher Trevor Bauer  of sexual assault  has been charged with defrauding the baseball player.An indictment unsealed Monday in Maricopa County Superior Court charges the woman with fraud and theft by extortion, both felonies, but doesn’t provide specific details about the alleged crimes. It says Bauer and one other person were defrauded in a scheme that potentially spanned several years.The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they have been victims of sexual assault unless they come forward publicly.The woman sued Bauer in December 2022, accusing him of rape two years earlier that she said resulted in pregnancy in late 2020.Court records on Tuesday afternoon didn’t list an attorney for the woman in the fraud case, and the lawyer representing her in her lawsuit didn’t immediately respond to a phone message seeking additional comment.Bauer was never arrested or charged. He countersued, saying he had one consensual sexual encounter with the woman in 2020 and then accused her of faking the pregnancy to extort money from him.His attorneys have said that the woman made several million-dollar demands against him.Bauer said he ultimately paid $8,761 for expenses he believed to be related to the woman’s reported pregnancy and its subsequent termination.The woman later said that she ultimately decided not to terminate the pregnancy, but had a miscarriage.She is scheduled to be arraigned on the criminal charges next Friday.In a recorded video statement released Tuesday, Bauer said he is innocent.“What else do I have to do to prove that this entire situation has been a massive lie? This is insane,” he said. “At what point do I get to go back to work and continue earning a living?”Bauer has been trying to revive his major league career after serving a suspension for violating the league’s domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse policy. He was suspended after another woman accused him of beating and sexually abusing her — an accusation the pitcher also denied.He was released by the Los Angeles Dodgers in January 2023 and played last year with the Yokohama DeNA BayStars of Japan’s Pacific League. He signed a deal this spring to pitch five games for Mexico’s Diablos Rojos and made his first appearance in a spring exhibition against the New York Yankees.",2024-04-17 17:02:00 PM EEST,NBC,A woman who accused Trevor Bauer of sex assault is now charged with defrauding the ex-MLB player,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/woman-accused-trevor-bauer-sex-assault-now-charged-defrauding-ex-mlb-p-rcna148158

Arturo Conde,"Comedian, actor and activist Cheech Marin says he doesn’t let rules govern his life. But for his new role in “The Long Game,” an underdog sports movie about  five Mexican American teens who win the Texas high school golf championship in 1957 despite the racism they faced at the time , Marin found inspiration in the rules that guided his father.“When my dad came back from World War II, the whole world was the Navy because he knew exactly what to do in that world,” Marin said in an interview with NBC News, describing the rules that his father followed to get through life after the military.“When he came out of the service, he was bewildered because he wasn’t accepted in a lot of employable positions,” Marin said about his Mexican American father. “And he became a policeman, which was all rules. So he was safe in that environment.”    The movie ""The Long Game"" tells the real-life story of J.B. Peña (played by actor Jay Hernandez), a World War II veteran and school district superintendent who’s rejected from membership at the whites-only San Felipe Country Club in Del Rio, Texas, because he's Mexican American. He goes on, however, to form a high school golf team, the Mustangs, for the Mexican American teens who were caddies at the whites-only club and had fallen in love with the sport. The golf team  went on to win the high school championship .Marin plays Pollo, a World War I veteran who's a groundskeeper at the country club — where he, like Peña, could not have been a member because of his ethnicity.In the film also starring Dennis Quaid, viewers see Marin wearing a large cage over his head to protect himself from stray golf balls on the course. While the cage may look like a comedic prop, Marin said it symbolizes the “shell shock” or trauma that veterans like his father and other Mexican Americans carried as civilians once they came back.“I kind of based it on anybody who comes out of a World War or any kind of big war. They come out of that traumatized,” he said, reflecting on his character in the movie. “This cage that he wears is his armor against the outside world.”  In the movie, Pollo tells Peña that when he was serving in World War I, the military did not give him a gas mask in the trenches. But, Pollo tells Peña, you still have to ""play as it lies,"" a golf expression that means you have to play the ball wherever it falls — and deal with current realities.     “He has to deal with not only having had mustard gas, which really affects you, but how he fits into his own hometown,” Marin said, dissecting his character. “He’s now a stranger in his own hometown. So that kind of affects how he sees the world, how he hides from it and then, how he comes out every once in a while.”“The Long Game,” Marin said, is a story about being accepted. And the five Mexican American teens' victory is a symbol of earning that respect.“The first year they put a team together, they won the state championship at the course that they weren’t allowed to play on as players,” Marin said. “So you saw the change happening right then and there.”Off-screen, fans know Marin as a counterculture icon and half of the iconic comedic duo Cheech and Chong, along with his roles in movies such as “Up in Smoke” (1978) and “Born in East L.A.” (1987) and in the TV show “Nash Bridges,” among others.When asked to look back on the classic comedies and shows that helped make his career, Marin said there are many more Latino stories now than before.“You can’t turn on TV today without seeing a lot of Latino characters in every show that you watch. And maybe some of our biggest stars are Latinos, especially in music,” he said. “And so, we made a lot of progress, and there’s still progress to be made.”One area where Marin has pushed for greater acceptance and visibility is the arts: A big patron and collector, especially of Chicano art, Marin partnered in 2022 with the Riverside Art Museum and the city of Riverside in California to  create a permanent museum space for Chicano art . The museum has drawn praise for its focus on U.S. Latino art.Marin said that while Latinos are making breakthroughs as a community, Hispanics are not “really accepted into the mainstream” until they have their own museum.“One of the people I talked to in the museum world when we started [the museum space] said, ‘We’ll come back and check in with you in about 20 years, 'cause that’s the least amount of time that you have to put in order to be accepted as official,’” Marin said. “I’m going to stay alive just for that purpose.”For more from NBC Latino,  sign up for our weekly newsletter .",2024-04-17 19:44:00 PM EEST,NBC,Cheech Marin draws on the discrimination his WWII veteran dad experienced for his new movie role,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cheech-marin-draws-discrimination-wwii-veteran-dad-felt-role-movie-lon-rcna147932
Kalhan Rosenblatt,"When Konrad Pawlikowski finished making his lighthearted horror game, he committed a cardinal sin of game development: He didn’t market it. But as an indie developer who makes games in his spare time, he didn’t think he needed to. Please Stop Crying, a first-person fatherhood simulator, was a passion project. He worked on it while he was juggling parenting his infant daughter and working his full-time job making interactive learning modules for an oil and gas company .  In March, after a month of having worked on the game, he uploaded it to the platform Steam, where he priced it at $2.99 per download. Much to his surprise, Please Stop Crying became a hit on a different platform: TikTok.For years, TikTok has been a go-to for music discovery — giving lesser-known artists a way to rise to stardom if their songs go viral. Now, some indie developers like Pawlikowski say the platform is having a similar impact in the gaming world by helping bolster smaller titles. “I definitely think TikTok has a lot of marketing potential for small indie developers,” Pawlikowski, 25, said. “As a game dev, it’s amazing when you see people playing and enjoying your game.”With TikTok’s live feature, which  launched in 2019 , content creators can livestream from the platform. Livestreaming has been a cornerstone of the gaming world for years on platforms like YouTube and Twitch, where people play games while simultaneously streaming them for their audiences.Indie games in particular are having a moment on TikTok Live, where some smaller streamers have said they’ve found success attracting new audiences with more off-the-radar titles. In recent months,   games like Fruit Mountain, developed by the Japanese gaming studio BeXide; That’s Not My Neighbor, developed by Nacho Sama; and Content Warning, developed by the Swedish studio Landfall Games, have become wildly popular among streamers on TikTok Live. Hashtags of the game titles have racked up millions of page views.   Sam Clark, known to his followers at @SammyC_TV, said he has seen more engagement streaming on TikTok than he has had on Twitch. “I think it can be attributed to these indie games,” he said. “They basically kind of helped me explode a little bit.”Clark said many of his 24,000 followers tune in specifically for his streams playing Fruit Mountain, a game that requires players to toss fruits on a plate and combine them with other fruits.It has proven to be one of the more popular indie games on the platform. As of   April 5, videos  including  the hashtag #FruitMountain had 87.9 million views. Videos with the  phrase  “Where to get Fruit Mountain” had 21.6 million views.TikTok has become an ideal place to popularize simple indie games because viewers can jump into a stream at any time without having to know a game’s backstory, Clark said. He also described the platform’s endless-scroll homepage as a unique benefit that distinguishes it from Twitch.In recent years, TikTok has made an effort to entice more gamers to come to its platform. In 2021, it  launched  The Game Room, an initiative to spotlight gamers who livestream on the platform. TikTok has also added things like  subscription perks , features reminiscent of Twitch. A spokesperson for TikTok didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Attention from streamers has helped game developers like Pawlikowski, who said he has already earned a few thousand dollars on Please Stop Crying.As the traditional gaming industry goes through a transitional period because of  mass layoffs  and underperforming better-known mainstream games, Pawlikowski said he anticipates indie games will have a moment in the spotlight. He hopes to see more “developers shift their focus.”“I think there’s a little bit of corporate greed, and nowadays, games are just seen as this, like, dollar signs where they just generate profit,” Pawlikowski said, adding, “I believe games are more about expression and art and just creating something that players would like to play.”",2024-04-17 16:00:00 PM EEST,NBC,TikTok Live is helping some indie games find a larger audience,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/video-games/tiktok-live-streamers-indie-games-finding-audience-rcna147629

Marlene Lenthang,"Basketball superstar Caitlin Clark has broken another yet another record — her Indiana Fever jersey is the top-selling jersey ever for a draft pick. Clark, 22, has had quite the year  shattering records  on the court for the Iowa Hawkeyes and  boosting women’s basketball viewership . It was no surprise this week when she was selected as the  No. 1 overall pick  in the 2024 WNBA draft by the Indiana Fever. Her Fever jersey with the number 22 is already the top-earning jersey ever for a draft pick, according to the licensed sportswear retailer Fanatics. The Fanatics website said Wednesday that it was “sold out” of its initial batch of the jersey but that pre-orders were still available and that restock is expected to ship in August. Clark’s star power also set a television milestone — ESPN coverage of the WNBA draft averaged a record 2.45 million viewers, with viewership peaking at 3.09 million, the network said in a  news release . That’s four times the viewership of the 2023 draft, which drew an audience of 572,000,  ESPN  reported, and it eclipses the previous draft record of 601,000, in 2004. The Clark effect has also led to a pickup in ticket sales. Even before the draft, soon after Clark announced her plans to enter the WNBA draft, the Fever had a spike in ticket inquiries,  The Associated Press  previously reported. Meanwhile, the  Las Vegas Aces  announced their July 2 game against the Fever would move from the 12,000-seat Michelob Ultra Arena to T-Mobile Arena, which seats 18,000 for basketball.“This is a dream. This is something I wrote down on a piece of paper when I was in, like, second grade. Get a basketball scholarship. Play in the WNBA,” Clark previously told NBC News correspondent Stephanie Gosk. At her introductory news conference with the Fever on Wednesday, Clark said: “I can’t think of a better place to start off my career.”Asked how she hopes to inspire the next generation, she said: “A lot of the reason I am who I am today is that I had this constant confidence in myself. I think that’s a thing a lot of young girls struggle with today.“It’s really the support system around them that instills that confidence in them. That’s what I'm so lucky for, whether it was youth coaches I had growing up, whether it was high school coaches, whether it was my parents, whether it was my family, they never told me I couldn't achieve something,"" she said. ""It was always like, 'If you want it you can go get it; you just have to earn it,'"" she said.

"Drew Weisholtz, TODAY,Joyann Jeffrey, TODAY","Simone Biles says the backlash that her husband, Jonathan Owens, received after his viral interview “really hurt” her.In the April 17 episode of Alex Cooper’s  “Call Her Daddy” podcast , Biles addressed Owens appearance on  “The Pivot”  podcast in which he seemingly  implied that he was “the catch” in their relationship  and had no clue who Biles was before they got together.“I was in the room. I was sitting on the chair. You just couldn’t see me on the videos I was there for the whole entire video,” Biles said, noting that she was “feeling great” in the moment and thought nothing of his remarks.“I was like, ‘My man just killed that,’” she joked of how he handled his interview.However, Biles soon found out that the public felt differently, with many reaching out to her to tell her so.“So, whenever he did that interview, I thought everything was OK. And then I go on Twitter, and everybody’s like, divorce this man, he’s mean. I’m like, he’s the sweetest. He praises the ground that I walk on. Truly, I’ve never met a man like him,” she said.As for him supposedly not calling her a “catch,” Biles says that fans got it wrong and misinterpreted his words.“He never said I wasn’t a catch. He said he was a catch because he is,” she explained. “I’ve never met a man like him. A lot of people that meet him are like, ‘Oh my gosh, I want a man like that,’” she said, adding that Owens is “so nice” and “a lot” of girls he interacts with at the gym “love him.”Biles said that’s why she couldn’t understand why his comments went viral. After taking a moment to think about it, Biles said that social media users were probably “mad that he didn’t include me in the interview.”But, she noted that it didn’t bother her to not be included in his interview because it was his time to shine.“He has to have his moments too and I let him have it,” she said.“It’s like, this is his moment. That’s his interview. What was I supposed to interrupt that interview and be like, ‘Hey, da da da,’” she added.Despite thinking that the whole controversy was “hilarious,” Biles noted that the public scrutiny did eventually get to her.“So I thought it was hilarious at first and then they hurt my feelings,” she said. “One night, I broke down and I’m like, why are you guys talking about my husband like this? You don’t know him, you don’t know who he is, and if anybody’s met him, they know he’s the sweetest guy and will do anything for anybody.”“So, that really hurt that they were talking about my husband like that because for me, it’s like, talk about me all you want, but don’t come from my family. Never,” she said.What else did Biles say on ‘Call Her Daddy’?During her interview with Cooper, Biles also talked about the time   she suffered from the  “twisties ” while competing at the Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 2021.The phenomenon occurs when a gymnast loses track of where they are in midair, making it hard to safely land. It  happened to Biles  while she performed her vault routine before she landed on the mat.“So, I open landed like that and as soon as I land, I kind of grin and I’m like, ‘S---,’” she said in a preview clip, provided exclusively to TODAY.com, from her interview on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast. The full episode will be released April 17.Biles is the most decorated gymnast of all time, but  withdrew from multiple events  in Tokyo after the twisties episode. She said she believed everybody was going to have it in for her after letting them down.“America hates me. The world is going to hate me. I can only see what they’re saying on Twitter right now,” she recalled thinking at the time.“And I salute and I want to run. If I could’ve gotten on a plane and flown home, I would’ve done it. I thought I was going to be banned from America ‘cause that’s what they tell you: ‘Don’t come back if not gold. Gold or bust. Don’t come back.’”Biles, who’s discussed her  mental health struggles  in the wake of what happened in Tokyo, is  eyeing a return  to the Olympics this summer in Paris.Last October, Hoda Kotb  asked her on TODAY  what the odds would be of Biles being part of Team USA in the Olympics if Hoda were to wager $100 on it at that point in time.“I think you’d be pretty lucky, Hoda,” Biles said before smiling.A month earlier, in regard to going to the Paris Olympics,  Biles said on TODAY , “Right now, I would say that’s the path I would love to go, so I wouldn’t mind if you put it in the ‘yay’ section.”Biles also said she’s made a point of being more diligent when it comes to looking after herself since Tokyo.“I think I have to take care of myself a little bit more and listen to my body and making sure that I’m making time for the important things in my life, rather than before, it was just ‘go, go, go,’ and then making time after,” she told TODAY in her September interview.",2024-04-18 17:26:00 PM EEST,NBC,Simone Biles says the backlash from husband's viral interview 'really hurt',https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/simone-biles-says-backlash-husbands-viral-interview-really-hurt-rcna148379
The Associated Press,"Golden State guard Stephen Curry knew he was running out of chances to play in what would be  his first Olympics , so he and his wife Ayesha started planning many months ago about how to make the Paris Games work for their family.Their growing family, that is.Ayesha Curry revealed in March that she is pregnant with the couple’s fourth child and the baby is due in June. That’s not entirely by accident; the couple thought ahead with hopes of keeping the Olympic months of July and August clear — just in case.“We thought about it ahead of time, which was nice,” Curry said. “If the timing didn’t work at a certain month in the fall, we actually would have made a different decision knowing the Olympics were on the radar. So, thankfully, the Lord looked out for us and if everything goes to plan, I’ll be available this summer.”That is, indeed, the plan. Curry was one of the 12 names formally announced by USA Basketball on Wednesday as the initial roster for this year’s Paris Olympics. It’s entirely possible that the roster gets tweaked between now and the first practice in early July — injuries or long playoff runs could spark changes — but Curry has been planning to make his Olympic debut this summer for some time.“I wanted to play in the last two that I was eligible for,” Curry said, referring to the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games and the Tokyo Games that were delayed to 2021 because of the pandemic. “Watching guys that I’ve been competing against the last 10 years all have that experience win gold medals, watching three of my teammates (Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green) win gold medals, I knew I wanted to do that.”It would be logical to think that part of the recruitment pitch to Curry this time around was the fact that the Olympic team is coached by Steve Kerr, his coach with the Warriors.That wasn’t really the case. Curry had talks with Durant and LeBron James about teaming up — those talks sparked in part by the U.S. taking a less star-studded team to the World Cup at Manila last summer and finishing fourth — but Kerr wasn’t pushing his best player to play this year.“He wanted to do it,” Kerr said. “He’s excited. I think 2016 would have been the year that made the most sense. In 2020, there was the pandemic. But I’ve never had the discussion with him. Going to the Finals wears you down and we had gone in 2015 and 2016. Then 2021 comes around, there was the pandemic, but now, it makes perfect sense. It’s another box to check in his career.”There aren’t too many of those boxes unchecked. And this might really be the last one of any significance left.He’s the NBA’s all-time 3-point recordholder, a four-time NBA champion, 10-time All-Star, nine-time (and probably soon to be 10-time) All-NBA selection, a two-time scoring champion, a two-time MVP, a Finals MVP, an All-Star MVP and a member of the league’s 75th anniversary team. He even helped put together one of the more memorable moments in All-Star history this year,  when he faced off with WNBA star Sabrina Ionescu  — someone he simultaneously mentors and admires — in a 3-point contest.The legacy has long been secure. But a little extra gold wouldn’t hurt.“That’s the goal,” Curry said.Curry and the Warriors won 46 games this season but didn’t make the NBA playoffs, falling to Sacramento on Tuesday in an elimination game of the  Western Conference play-in tournament, 118-94.  So, the next time he’s slated to play for real is now July, when the Americans convene for training camp in Las Vegas. The U.S. opens Olympic play against Serbia on July 28.Curry has played with “USA” across his chest plenty of times before, going back 17 years. He was on the under-19 team that won gold at the 2007 Global Games and won silver in that year’s U19 world championships — “that burned,” Curry said, “because you hate losing at anything.”He hasn’t lost a game with the national team since — 18 games, 18 wins. The Americans went 9-0 on their way to gold at the 2010 world championship (now called the World Cup), then went 9-0 on the way to another gold at the World Cup in 2014.“I definitely wanted this experience,” Curry said of playing in an Olympics. “I think the timing is just right. I’m later in my career. This is probably the last opportunity I have to play. And that made it a much easier decision to say, ‘This makes sense.’ And then I was talking to some other guys who were interested in playing, so you knew this could be a great team.”",2024-04-18 05:13:00 AM EEST,NBC,Stephen Curry and wife Ayesha planned new baby around Paris Olympics,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/stephen-curry-wife-ayesha-baby-paris-olympics-rcna148314
David K. Li,"The NBA banned Toronto Raptors forward Jontay Porter, alleging he bet on games, passed on information to gamblers and claimed illness to influence a wager, the league said Wednesday.Porter, 24, a 6-foot-10 power forward and center, is the brother of Denver Nuggets sharpshooter Michael Porter Jr. and has spent much of his pro career in the NBA's developmental G League.He played in 26 games for Toronto this season, averaging 4.4 points and 3.2 rebounds. He also got into 11 games for the Memphis Grizzlies in 2020-21, averaging 2.0 points and  1.3 rebounds.""There is nothing more important than protecting the integrity of NBA competition for our fans, our teams and everyone associated with our sport, which is why Jontay Porter's blatant violations of our gaming rules are being met with the most severe punishment,"" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement.The NBA said its investigation found that Porter had engaged in widespread gambling, against league rules.It alleged that he ""disclosed confidential information"" about his own health status to an individual he knew to be an NBA bettor"" before a March 20 game. Porter claimed to suffer from an illness during the game and played only three minutes, the league said.An $80,000 online bet that he would underperform was placed ahead of the March 20 game, which would have paid out $1.1 million. The conspicuously large amount led to the wager's being ""frozen"" and ""not paid out,"" the NBA said.When Porter was on the Raptors' G League affiliate from January to March, he placed at least 13 bets on NBA games using ""an associate's online betting account,"" the league said. The wagers ranged from $15 to $22,000 and totaled $54,094, according to the NBA. None of the bets were on games in which he played, the league said. Three of them were parlays — which require multiple correct results — with one calling for a Toronto loss, the league said.He ended up profiting $21,965 from all of the wagers.The National Basketball Players Association said it would ""make sure Jontay has access to the resources he needs during this time."" However, the union also reiterated its support of NBA gambling guidelines.""Adherence to league gambling policies is paramount to maintaining the integrity of our athletes and protecting the future of the sports,"" it said in a statement. ""The NBPA will continue to provide all players with training materials to ensure they understand how to properly navigate the complex sports betting landscape."" Porter is believed to be the first NBA player booted for gambling since  Jack Molinas of the Fort Wayne Pistons  was taken off the hardwood in 1954 for allegedly betting on games.""While legal sports betting creates transparency that helps identify suspicious or abnormal activity, this matter also raises important issues about the sufficiency of the regulatory framework currently in place,"" Silver said.Wednesday's announcement appeared to catch the team by surprise.“You don’t want this for the kid, you don’t want this for our team, and we don’t want this for our league, that’s for sure,” Raptors president Masai Ujiri said. “My first reaction is obviously surprise, because none of us, I don’t think anybody, saw this coming.”The league was  touched by a gambling scandal  in 2007 when  disgraced referee Tim Donaghy  pleaded guilty to two felonies connected to his bets on NBA games and his secretly advising professional gamblers.Gambling was once a complete taboo in professional and high-level college sports, with legal wagers on most sports taken only in Nevada.But sports betting  has taken off since 2018 , when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal law that had required states to ban such wagers.Now sports betting is  legal and operational in 38 state s  and Washington, D.C.  In 30 states  and the nation's capital, bettors can make wagers with taps on their phones.",2024-04-17 19:37:00 PM EEST,NBC,"Jontay Porter banned from NBA for gambling on games, giving info to bettors and limiting play for betting purposes",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/jontay-porter-banned-nba-gambling-games-giving-info-bettors-limiting-p-rcna148227
Juliette Arcodia,"The federal government has charged a man who it says moved millions of dollars’ worth of stolen merchandise and memorabilia from Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia, home of the Masters Tournament, for more than a dozen years. Richard Brendan Globensky is accused of transporting and transferring goods from 2009 until about 2022, according to federal charging documents. Federal prosecutors say Globensky transported millions of dollars’ worth of Masters golf tournament merchandise and historical memorabilia from  Augusta, Georgia, to Tampa, Florida.The government argues that Globensky knew the items were stolen when he transported them. The Justice Department requests that he forfeit “any property which constitutes and is derived from proceeds traceable to the offense, including a personal money judgment.” The  Chicago Tribune first reported  that Globensky had been employed by the club as a warehouse coordinator. The case has been filed in the Northern District of Illinois. Asked why it was filed in a jurisdiction outside Augusta or Tampa, Justice Department officials said that “we can’t comment on the case beyond what’s set forth in the charging document.” The Sheriff’s Office in Richmond County, which is where Augusta National Golf Club is, said it does not “have any record of an arrest or investigation of subject Richard Globensky.” Neither Globensky’s attorney nor Augusta National replied to requests for comment Thursday. Globensky’s arraignment and change of plea hearing is set for May 15 in federal court in Illinois. He was charged days after  Scottie Scheffler secured his second title  at the Masters Tournament — and once again the merch shop was a big part of the “tradition unlike any other.” Attending the Masters is a once-in-a-lifetime experience for many golf enthusiasts, and Augusta National has many restrictions when it comes to buying merchandise and memorabilia. The only way to buy the official, branded merchandise is in person at the golf shop on club property.  Forbes reported in 2022  that the Masters made nearly $70 million in merchandise sales in the week of the tournament — or about $10 million a day from selling items like golf hats and polos. This year’s Masters “merch hauls” have gone viral on social media, with  one user showing  off her purchases and racking up over 700,000 views on TikTok. Another  TikTok user  broke down the cost of some items, with a men’s polo costing $89 and hats costing about $32. Cellphones are banned at the golf club, so there are few images of what the shop or lines look like during the tournament.  Golf.com reported  the highest single purchase at the Masters Shop topped $30,000. ",2024-04-19 04:20:00 AM EEST,NBC,"Man charged with moving Masters goods, memorabilia taken from Augusta National",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/man-charged-moving-masters-goods-memorabilia-taken-augusta-masters-rcna148493
Rebecca Cohen,"Get ready for plenty of how-did-they-do-that moments when the Paris Games introduce break-dancing as an official  Olympic  sport. Bodies will be contorted, gravity will seemingly be defied, and athletes will be showcasing “headspins,” “windmills” and “freeze” moves — and it will all be set to music.The sport, also known as breaking, made its successful debut at the 2018 Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where it topped 1 million viewers, according to NBC Olympics, far outpacing audiences for many other sports.   The Olympics  declared it an ""outstanding success,"" and now both the organizers and the athletes hope to translate that magic to the biggest stage in sports. “This is a chance for us to grow and educate people on breaking,” Jeffrey Louis   (B-Boy Jeffro), told  NBC Olympics . Louis, the fifth-ranked B-boy in the world, is considered a favorite for one of the remaining spots on the U.S. Olympic team. Breaking joins other newer sports, including three that were added to the Olympic program for the first time at the 2020 Tokyo Games — surfing, skateboarding and sport climbing.Adding those sports to the official Olympics roster is an attempt by the International Olympic Committee to reach a younger audience, given that “all four are easy to take up and participants form communities that are very active on social media,”  according to the Paris Olympics .The committee, known as the IOC, hopes millions of kids worldwide will be inspired to take up the sports themselves.“If we get it right, we can create something unstoppable,” Louis said. “We can’t let it pass us up again, because the first time breaking blew up, it fizzled out.”<h2>What is breaking?</h2>The dance-battle sport is “characterised by acrobatic movements, stylised footwork and the key role played by the DJ and the MC (master of ceremonies) during battles,” according to the Paris Olympics. Some of the moves will have audiences wondering where the halfpipe is as athletes twist and turn like they should have boards under their feet. The sport’s techniques include top rock (standing footwork) and down rock (moves on the floor), power moves (twists and spins) and the freeze, when breakers freeze in poses while using their heads or hands for support. <h2>How will it work?</h2>The breaking competition in Paris will be divided into two events — one for women and one for men — and they will take place Aug. 9 and 10 at La Concorde Urban Park. In total, 16 B-boys or 16 B-girls will “go face to face in spectacular solo battles,” according to the Paris Olympics. The competitors will show off their best moves as they try to keep up with the beat of the DJ's tracks, improvising to stay alive in the dance battle with a combination of ""power moves,"" including windmills, the 6-step and freezes, according to the Paris Olympics.  Judges will then vote, paving the way for the first breaking medalists in Olympic history. <h2>Who is on the U.S. Olympic breaking team?</h2>The U.S. will be represented by four breakers — two B-boys and two B-girls — who will compete in solo battles for the gold medal. So far, two U.S. breakers have  qualified : Sunny Choi (B-Girl Sunny) and Victor Montalvo (B-Boy Victor).<h2>From the Bronx to Paris</h2>It has been a decades-long battle to get breaking to the main stage. The dance style, which has roots in hip-hop culture, originated at block parties in New York City in the 1970s, according to the Paris Olympics.Louis said the sport originated in a rec room in the Bronx, where “a legendary DJ named Kool Herc debuted a new technique that centered around percussive ‘breaks’ in songs. During these breaks, the crowd would start dancing, which became known as breaking, or breakdancing.”By the 1980s, it was hitting the mainstream with groups like the Rock Steady Crew, the Dynamic Rockers and the New York City Breakers, who innovated new — and more complex — moves. It gained wider visibility thanks in part to the 1983 movie ""Flashdance."" While the film included only a few short breaking scenes —  featuring the Rock Steady Crew  — USA Dance said it inspired people around the world to try breaking. But the end of the ’80s, it had fizzled. Breakers invited fellow dancers out of early retirement to jump-start the scene once again, according to  USA Dance . International Battle of the Year, the first large-scale, formally judged breaking event, began in the ’90s, which helped with the sport’s revival and ushered in a new era of interest. Other international competitions also began in the decade, some of which remain active today.International resurgence Since then, ""breaking has evolved into a global cultural art form with many elements of sport,"" according to USA Dance. The national organization says a number of breaking schools have opened across the U.S. in the last decade, providing spaces for a new, young generation of breakers to learn and hone the craft. The World DanceSport Federation now governs the sport internationally and is recognized by the IOC as such. Whitney Carter, director of internally managed sports at the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, helped form Breaking for Gold USA, a group dedicated to getting breakers in the country ready for the world's biggest games, NBC Olympics reported. ""Now, the USA is a front-runner at the Olympics,"" Tyquan Hodac, USA Dance's breaking communications director, told NBC Olympics. ""We’re the powerhouse. Every other country is looking up to us.""",2024-04-17 12:00:00 PM EEST,NBC,Break-dancing busts into the Olympics for the first time.

Daniel Arkin,"Start the countdown clock. In exactly 100 days, more than 10,000 athletes and tens of thousands of spectators will converge on Paris for the start of the  33rd Summer Olympic Games , a 16-day extravaganza that marks the first time the City of Lights has hosted the world’s pre-eminent sports festival  in a century.In keeping with the slogan for this year’s Olympics, “Games Wide Open,” the opening ceremony will take place  outside a stadium setting  for the first time. The plans are ambitious: a 3.5-mile boat parade  along the Seine  before as many as 325,000 onlookers on the river’s banks. The hundreds of athletic events — hosted by dozens of venues across Paris and other cities in metropolitan France — will likewise be open to large crowds.In many respects, the Paris Games promise to be one of the most  elaborate cultural rituals  since Covid swept across the world beginning in late 2019. Health restrictions forced the organizers of Tokyo 2020 and Beijing 2022 to sharply limit the scale of the festivities, with events largely closed to the public. Paris 2024, powered in part by pent-up demand for communal experiences, symbolizes an international  post-pandemic vibe shift.But with that spirit of openness comes all-too-familiar challenges. The festivities in Europe’s most densely populated city are shadowed by  security concerns . The International Olympic Committee and French officials have insisted that they are putting strict security measures in place. Yet the recent history of violence in France — including the 2015 terror attack in Paris that left 138 people dead and at least 416 injured — stalks public consciousness there.The geopolitical backdrop for the  Paris Games  is no less troubling. The war between Israel and Hamas recently crossed the six-month mark, raising fears of a protracted conflict and wider regional instability. The devastation in the Gaza Strip has provoked international outrage, isolating Israel on the global stage. Meanwhile, Russia continues to gain ground in its military offensive against Ukraine as some Western nations worry about the rise of authoritarianism.These international crises could come into play during the Games in the form of protests and other political demonstrations.“It is certain that the international context is particularly tense today,” Tony Estanguet, president of the Games’ organizing committee,  recently told Radio France . “I believe in this universal event. It’s up to us to preserve, to talk about sport and not to politicize the subject too much.”Nevertheless, Olympics organizers are determined to put on a show that stuns the throngs assembled on the boulevards of Paris, not to mention the millions of people expected to watch the Games unfold on their televisions and mobile devices. If the surge of enthusiasm for the Super Bowl, Taylor Swift, March Madness and the solar eclipse is any guide, then audiences are craving spectacle — and the Paris Games could be just the ticket.Going for the goldThe scale of the Paris Games is immense: nearly 40 sports and more than 300 events hosted in at least 35 venues in Paris and other cities across metropolitan France. Following two Games that were hampered by Covid protocols and other tight restrictions, Paris could resemble a colossal international party, heralded by five Olympic rings (fashioned from recycled French steel) that will be displayed on the south side of the Eiffel Tower.“The last two Olympics certainly didn’t have the look and feel of what we expect from the Games,” said Jeremy Fuchs, a sports writer and the author of a 2021 book about the history of the Olympics. “I would expect Paris to go all out. … With fans back in the stands, we should expect one of the more raucous Games in recent memory.”The iconic landmarks will be immediately recognizable to worldwide TV viewers. Beach volleyball players will show off their jump serves at  a temporary outdoor arena  at the Champ de Mars, a large public park at the foot of the Eiffel Tower. Equestrian and modern pentathlon competitions will take place at  the Palace of Versailles , one of the emblems of French royal history. The 124-year-old Grand Palais will host fencing and taekwondo.At least one venue that hosted events during the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris will be put to use again: Stade Yves-du-Manoir, the home of the opening ceremony 100 years ago. (The stadium also hosted some of the races depicted in the Oscar-winning film “Chariots of Fire.”) This time around, the 117-year-old arena will stage field hockey competitions.The sports themselves are sure to draw wide attention, from basketball and boxing to sailing and swimming.  Breaking  (also known as break dancing) is set to make its Olympics debut, and three recently introduced competitions — sport climbing, skateboarding and surfing — will be integrated into the Paris Games, too. (Karate, softball and baseball won’t be part of the lineup.)The vast majority of events are set to unfold across France, though there is one exception. The surfing competition will take place in a village on the southwestern coast of Tahiti. Paris organizers chose to hold the surfing events on the French Polynesian island because it “offers an opportunity to engage French overseas territories and their communities in the Olympic Games — for the first time in history — while showcasing France’s rich and diverse heritage.”Paris organizers have signaled that they are attempting to reach younger audiences by featuring sports that are “closely associated with youth and reward creativity and athletic performance.” But given that relatively few people in their teens and 20s watch traditional linear television, the IOC faces a steep climb in convincing viewers in that age bracket to tune in, according to David Goldblatt, the author of “The Games: A Global History of the Olympics.”This year’s Games will be more widely accessible to at-home viewers thanks in part to streaming. Peacock, the streaming platform owned by NBCUniversal, plans to invest heavily in live coverage of the festivities, including a “multiview” feature that allows subscribers to watch up to four competitions at the same time.Superstar personalities could help make the case for the Games as must-see TV. Simone Biles, the seven-time Olympic medal-winning gymnast, hopes to compete in Paris. The list of U.S. athletes who could make waves also includes swimmer Katie Ledecky as well as track-and-field sprinters Noah Lyles and Sha’Carri Richardson.David Wallechinsky, a former president of the International Society of Olympic Historians and the author of “The Complete Book of the Olympics,” said he was most excited about the track-and-field competitions because he believes the sport has the most universal appeal — unlike, say, “swimming the 400-meter medley or participating in equestrian dressage.”In total, more than 200 countries — known in IOC parlance as national olympic committees, or NOCs — plan to send their most elite athletes to Paris, where most will check into  the Olympic Village  on the banks of the Seine. Russia and Belarus were banned from the Olympics after Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022 — four days after the conclusion of the Winter Olympics in Beijing.The final stretchIn recent months, preparations for the Games have arguably been overshadowed by the grinding realities of war and humanitarian disaster. Paris 2024 is just the latest in a long line of Olympic Games that have taken place against a backdrop of geopolitical turmoil, according to Wallechinsky, who pointed to several key examples.The 1936 Summer Olympics were hosted by Berlin and opened by Adolf Hitler three years before the outbreak of World War II. Twenty-nine countries boycotted the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal to protest the fact that New Zealand’s rugby team had toured apartheid South Africa. The massacre of 11 Israeli athletes and coaches by Palestinian members of the Black September terrorist organization cast a pall over the 1972 Summer Games in Munich and underscored the violent tensions that are often inseparable from the athletic competitions at the heart of the Olympics.In the Cold War era, the U.S. led a boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow and the former Soviet Union sat out the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.In the lead-up to the Paris Games, France announced it would deploy 45,000 police, military officers and army troops across the country. The country has requested reinforcements from 46 foreign partners — a “classic approach adopted by host countries when organizing major international events,” the Interior Ministry has said. Everyone involved in the Games — security officials, building workers, volunteers — will be put through background checks, too.French government officials also decided to  cap the number of people  allowed to watch the opening ceremony at 325,000. Two years ago, organizers had proposed making the July 26 opening festivities accessible to as many as 600,000 people, a grand gathering that would span 6 kilometers (roughly 3.7 miles), stretching from the east of Paris to the Trocadéro.In response to a request for comment on the security fears, an IOC spokesperson said French authorities had informed the committee that “they have been working for a couple of years under the assumption that the highest security measures will be required.” The spokesperson said that, per usual practices, “there is also very close international cooperation.”“Based on this and the regular reports the IOC receives from them, we have full confidence in the French authorities and their strong collaboration with their international partners,” the spokesperson added.In the run-up to the opening ceremony, organizers are also confronting markedly less existential issues — including high levels of “pollution of fecal origin” and other  bacteria in the Seine , an environmental headache that might force officials to nix the triathlon swimming section.“We are working hard on it. You know it’s one of the bigger challenges,” Estanguet told reporters this month.In the end, though, spectators around the world will likely be focused on the pageantry and competition, savoring the first full-fledged Olympic Games in more than half a decade.Disclosure: NBC News parent company NBCUniversal owns NBC Sports and NBC Olympics.

Deon J. Hampton,"The news that basketball sensation Caitlin Clark will earn a base salary of $76,535 in her first year in the pros has shed light on why dozens of WNBA players travel abroad in the offseason to supplement their incomes.Clark became the face of college basketball this season as viewers tuned in to  nationally televised  University of Iowa games to witness her stunning three-point shots and Steph Curry-like game, shattering viewer records.After her selection as the No. 1 overall draft pick by the Indiana Fever this week, many assumed her mass popularity and skill set would lead to a multiyear contract worth millions.That didn't happen for a variety of reasons, mostly having to do with the WNBA's broadcast deal. Clark will make most of her money off the court.WNBA players earn only a fraction of what their male counterparts collect from the NBA, prompting many female players to travel to Europe and other basketball-obsessed locations around the globe for a chance to earn a heftier payday. Although the reasons why foreign leagues can afford higher salaries than the WNBA vary, the overseas teams are not limited by salary caps, like those in the U.S., and many are owned by billionaires who can spend as much as they want on players.Perhaps the most famous example of a player going overseas was Brittany Griner's trip to Moscow in 2022. The all-star Phoenix Mercury center was  detained in Russia  after customs agents said they discovered cartridges containing hashish oil in her luggage.Griner was sentenced to nine years in prison but was released in a high-profile  prisoner swap  with the U.S. after 294 days. Up until then, Russia had been a top destination for WNBA athletes in the offseason, with some earning salaries of over $1 million.“The whole reason a lot of us go [overseas] is the pay game,"" Griner told  Just Women’s Sports  last year. ""A lot of us go over there to make an income to support our families, to support ourselves. So I don’t knock any player that wants to go overseas.”Reasons for the wide pay disparity between the WNBA and the NBA are many, but basically, the women's league generates far less money. That's reflected in its TV rights deal, which is worth $65 million versus the NBA's $2.8 billion contract. It also plays 42 fewer games a season than the NBA.In many cases, a WNBA player can earn three to four times her base salary by playing overseas when the four-month U.S. season ends.Historically, many WNBA players find that extra income attractive, said Ketra Armstrong, a professor of sport management and the director of the Center for Race & Ethnicity in Sport at the University of Michigan.""We have the best basketball players in the world,"" Armstrong said. ""And they (other countries) show them how much they’re valued by giving them lucrative salaries.”Under the league’s  collective bargaining agreement , Clark’s four-year contract will pay her $76,535 during her first season. That salary   will increase incrementally to $97,582 in her final year.By comparison,  Victor Wembanyama , the No. 1 overall pick in last year’s NBA draft, signed a four-year, $55 million contract for which he’ll pocket $12.1 million this season, according to contract tracker  Spotrac .The Women’s National Basketball Players Association, the WNBA players' union, could not be reached for comment, and its NBA counterpart, the National Basketball Players Association, declined to comment on the pay disparity.The WNBA has said Clark will receive more than $3 million in endorsements and partnerships. She also was  reportedly  in talks to sign an eight-figure endorsement deal with Nike that would include a signature shoe line.But not every WNBA player will be as fortunate.“It should come as no surprise that there’s such a huge gap between the NBA and WNBA,” said Rob Parker, a nationally syndicated radio host for Fox Sports and a sports media professor at the University of Southern California.He said fans have not wholeheartedly supported the WNBA since its inception nearly 30 years ago.“The attendance is low. The television ratings are low. So it’s no shocker that there’s no money there for the women,” Parker said.Typically, when athletes go overseas, they compete against other Americans and foreign players for league championships. Many players in recent years have also opted to stay in the U.S. in the offseason to take advantage of new financial opportunities in broadcasting, coaching and marketing ventures, experts said.Some said WNBA players could earn higher salaries in coming years if the league is able to capitalize on the nation's newfound wave of enthusiasm for women's basketball.The WNBA’s television rights deal expires after the 2025 season, and a sustained uptick in viewership could be used as a bargaining chip, Armstrong said.“The new players coming into the WNBA coupled with the current stars of the league may be the catalyst the WNBA needs for more investment and better television rights,” Armstrong said.She said some teams are already seeing sales spikes in tickets and  jerseys.  “There’s been a dramatic surge in college basketball and interest, and I do believe some of the traction will carry over into the WNBA,” she said.Parker said he doesn't think Clark can single-handedly turn the WNBA into a ratings juggernaut. “Caitlin Clark to me will be like the Harlem Globetrotters,"" he said. ""When she shows up to town, people will come to see her. But I’m not so sure that people will come to the WNBA when she’s not involved.”",2024-04-19 21:46:00 PM EEST,NBC,Why many WNBA players leave the U.S. to supplement their incomes,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/many-wnba-players-leave-us-supplement-incomes-rcna148192
Reuters,"HONG KONG — The winner of  Beijing’s half marathon , He Jie, and three African runners have had their results canceled after an investigation found that the three slowed down near the finish line allowing the Chinese athlete to finish first, organizers said Friday.He had won the race held last Sunday in China’s capital in a time of 1:03:44, a second ahead of Ethiopian Dejene Hailu Bikila and Kenyans Robert Keter and Willy Mnangat, who tied for second place.The organizing committee said in a statement that the three African runners “actively slowed down in the last 2 kilometers and as a result He Jie won the men’s championship.”All trophies, medals and bonuses will be withdrawn and the athletes will be reported to the Chinese Athletics Association, it said.The race operator, the Zhong’ao Lupao Beijing Sports Management company, will also be disqualified from hosting and operating the Beijing half marathon, the committee added.Mnangat told the BBC that the trio ran as pacemakers and were not competing.However, the committee said pacers would not have been allowed to participate as specially invited athletes without organizers’ approval.The Zhong’ao Lupao Beijing Sports Management company said its partner Xiamen Xtep Investment, a unit of Hong Kong-listed Xtep, failed to note the relevant pacer information, which led to the organizing committee not being informed.“Our company has unshirkable responsibility and would like to express our sincere apologies to all runners.” He has been sponsored by Xtep since 2021, according to its website.Xtep said staff had made a mistake during the registration process and did not identify the pacers.“We bear a great responsibility and fully accept the punishment decision made by the organizing committee,” Xtep said in a statement.He was slightly behind the three African runners as they approached the end of the race, but they slowed down and waved the Chinese athlete ahead as they gestured toward the finish line. The four had run together throughout the race of just over 13 miles.The finish drew widespread skepticism, with some social media users commenting that the result was “embarrassing” for He, a member of China’s marathon team and a national record holder.Long-distance running races are increasingly popular in China but have a checkered history of cheating and poor organization. In Shenzhen’s 2018 half marathon, 258 participants were caught cheating, most of whom had taken shortcuts though some wore fake bibs and others were impostors.",2024-04-19 18:22:00 PM EEST,NBC,Chinese runner's win is revoked after investigation into Beijing Half Marathon,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/beijing-half-marathon-chinese-runners-win-revoked-rcna148555
Phil Helsel,"An Indianapolis sports columnist has apologized for flashing a heart symbol with his hands, as well as for his subsequent comments, to new Indiana Fever player Caitlin Clark in what soon became an “ awkward ” interaction.Indianapolis Star columnist Gregg Doyel made the heart symbol while he was speaking to Clark at her introductory news conference with the WNBA team, to which she responded, “You like that?” Doyel replied, “I like that you’re here.”Clark, who broke the NCAA scoring record for both women and men as an Iowa Hawkeye and  was the No. 1 pick  in  Monday’s WNBA draft , said, “I do that at my family after every game, so it’s pretty cool.”“OK, well, start doing it to me and we’ll get along just fine,” Doyel replied, before he asked a question about Clark’s decision to turn pro and enter the draft.Doyel apologized in a column published online Wednesday night.“I’m devastated to realize I’m part of the problem,” he wrote.Doyel said he is known for having awkward conversations with people before asking “brashly conversational questions.” He’d done so for years with Indianapolis Colts coaches, as well as with Purdue University and Indiana University players, he wrote. He called himself “another insensitive man” and said he offended Clark and her family while trying to be “clever” and “welcoming.” “After going through denial, and then anger — I’m on the wrong side of this? Me??? — I now realize what I said and how I said it was wrong, wrong, wrong. I mean it was just wrong,” Doyel wrote. “Caitlin Clark, I’m so sorry.”Clark and her representatives could not immediately be reached for comment late Wednesday.Clark, 22, broke the women’s NCAA all-time scoring record in February and then  broke the men’s record  a month later. She ended with 3,951 career points.With Clark playing, the women’s NCAA championship game between the Hawkeyes and the South Carolina Gamecocks drew  more viewers than the men’s championship game  for the first time.Iowa lost to South Carolina for the title, but Gamecocks coach Dawn Staley singled out Clark for lifting up women’s basketball.Clark has since made multiple high-profile media appearances, including on NBC’s  “TODAY”  and  “Saturday Night Live.”  In another sign of fans’ excitement, her Indiana Fever jersey became the  top-selling jersey ever for a draft pick .",2024-04-18 14:05:00 PM EEST,NBC,Indianapolis columnist apologizes to Caitlin Clark over 'awkward' heart gesture,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/columnist-apologizes-caitlin-clark-heart-gesture-rcna148326

The Associated Press,"LOS ANGELES — Carl Erskine, who pitched two no-hitters as a mainstay on the Brooklyn Dodgers and was a 20-game winner in 1953 when he struck out a then-record 14 in the World Series, died Tuesday. He was 97.Erksine died at Community Hospital Anderson in his hometown of Anderson, Indiana, according to Michele Hockwalt, the hospital’s marketing and communication manager.Among the last survivors from the celebrated Brooklyn teams of the 1950s, Erskine spent his entire major league career with the Dodgers from 1948-59, helping them win five National League pennants.The right-hander had a career record of 122-78 and an ERA of 4.00, with 981 strikeouts.Erskine had his best season in 1953, when he went 20-6 to lead the National League. He won Game 3 of the World Series, beating the Yankees 3-2 at Ebbets Field. He struck out 14, retiring the side in the ninth, for a record that stood until Dodgers ace Sandy Koufax got 15 in 1963. The Dodgers went on to lose in six games as the Yankees won their fifth consecutive championship.Erskine was an All-Star in 1954, when he won 18 games.He appeared in five World Series, with the Dodgers finally beating the Yankees in 1955 for their only championship in Brooklyn. He gave up a home run to Gil McDougald in the first inning of Game 4 and left after 3 2/3 innings. The Dodgers went on to win 8-5.Erskine’s death leaves the 88-year-old Koufax as the lone surviving Dodgers player from the 1955 World Series team.“I’ve often thought Carl deserved more credit than he received for his contributions to the success of the Brooklyn Dodgers,” said Peter O’Malley, whose father, Walter, owned the Dodgers from 1950-1979. “He was a calming influence on a team with many superstars and personalities. But getting credit was not Carl and that is what made him beloved.”Erskine received the Buck O’Neil lifetime achievement award in July 2023 by the Baseball Hall of Fame’s board of directors to honor an individual whose efforts enhance baseball’s positive impact on society.“For millions of fans, he was a baseball hero,” Hall of Fame chairman Jane Forbes Clark said in a statement. “For his family and thousands of Special Olympians, Carl was someone who always believed everything was possible. His legacy is one of deep compassion and encouragement of the human spirit.”Carl Daniel Erskine was born Dec. 13, 1926, in Anderson, Indiana. He began playing baseball at age 9 in a local parks program.After graduating high school in 1945, he was drafted into the Navy with World War II underway. A year later, Erskine asked the Navy recreation officer where he was stationed if he could play baseball. He was turned away, but a few weeks later, he was scouted by the Dodgers and discharged from military service.He spent the next 1 1/2 years in the minors before making his major league debut on July 25, 1948. Erskine began as a reliever, going 21-10 during his first two seasons.In 1951, he transitioned to the starting rotation and joined teammates Roy Campanella, Carl Furillo, Gil Hodges, Jackie Robinson and Duke Snider as one of the revered “Boys of Summer.”In 1952, Erskine had a career-best 2.70 ERA and won 14 games. The following year, he led the NL with a .769 winning percentage, along with 187 strikeouts and 16 complete games, all career highs.When teammate Don Newcombe was pitching in the ninth inning of Game 3 of the 1951 NL pennant with the New York Giants, Erskine and Ralph Branca were warming up in the bullpen.On the recommendation of pitching coach Clyde Sukeforth, Newcombe was relieved by Branca, who then gave up the game-winning home run to Bobby Thomson in the famed “Shot Heard ’Round the World.”Whenever Erskine was asked what his best pitch was, he replied, “The curveball I bounced in the Polo Grounds bullpen in 1951.”Nicknamed “Oisk” by fans with their Brooklyn accents, Erskine pitched no-hitters against the Chicago Cubs in 1952 and the New York Giants in 1956.Bobby Morgan preserved Erskine’s no-hitter against the Cubs with two brilliant fielding plays at third base.“I made two super plays on swinging bunts where they just dribbled down the line and I fielded them one-handed and threw to Gil Hodges at first,” Morgan told The Oklahoman newspaper in April 2020.Morgan, who died last year, said Erskine still thanked him years later whenever they spoke.The Dodgers left Brooklyn for Los Angeles in 1957. Erskine started the first home game in Los Angeles on April 18, 1958, when the Dodgers beat the San Francisco Giants 6-5 in front of more than 78,000 fans.However, Erskine didn’t enjoy being away from his family and he lasted just 1 1/2 years in Los Angeles. He pitched his final game in June 1959 and retired at 32.Erskine returned to his hometown about 45 miles northeast of Indianapolis and opened an insurance business. He coached baseball at Anderson College for 12 years, and his 1965 team went 20-5 and won the NAIA World Series.He also became active in the community and served as president and director at Star Financial Bank from 1982-93.A 6-foot bronze statue of Erskine was erected in front of the Carl D. Erskine Rehabilitation and Sports Medicine Center to honor his accomplishments in baseball and as an Anderson resident. An elementary school built on land he donated is named for him. He was inducted into the Indiana National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1979.In 2002, Erskine Street in Brooklyn was named for him.His youngest son, Jimmy, was born with Down syndrome, which led Erskine to champion the cause of people with developmental disabilities. He wrote a book called “The Parallel,” about the similarities Jimmy and Erskine’s teammate Robinson shared in breaking down social perceptions. He was long involved with Special Olympics in Indiana and the Carl and Betty Erskine Society raises money for the organization.“Carl Erskine was an exemplary Dodger,” Stan Kasten, Dodgers president and CEO, said in a statement. “He was as much a hero off the field as he was on the field, which given the brilliance of his pitching is saying quite a lot. His support of the Special Olympics and related causes, inspired by his son Jimmy, who led a life beyond all expectations when he was born with Down syndrome, cemented his legacy.”Jimmy died in November at age 63, outliving his prognosis by decades.Erskine also authored the books “Tales from the Dodger Dugout” and “What I Learned From Jackie Robinson.”He is survived by Betty, his wife of 76 years, and sons Danny and Gary and daughter Susan.",2024-04-17 16:38:00 PM EEST,NBC,"Carl Erskine, Dodgers pitcher and last surviving member of ‘Boys of Summer,’ dies at 97",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/carl-erskine-dodgers-pitcher-last-surviving-member-boys-summer-dies-97-rcna148156

Mithil Aggarwal,"Google has fired  more than two dozen employees for  protesting  its  $1.2 billion contract  to provide the  Israeli government and military  with cloud and artificial intelligence services.Twenty-eight people were fired after nine employees were arrested Tuesday night following a sit-in at the company’s offices in Seattle, New York and Sunnyvale, California — including one at Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian’s office, according to the group that organized the demonstration, No Tech for Apartheid.Protesters sat in his office for more than nine hours, wearing shirts and raising banners that read “No more genocide for profit,” until they were eventually arrested. It is the latest  high-profile clash in the U .S.  stoked by tensions over the  Israel-Hamas war .“These protests were part of a longstanding campaign by a group of organizations and people who largely don’t work at Google,"" a Google spokesperson said in a statement Wednesday. ""A small number of employee protesters entered and disrupted a few of our locations. Physically impeding other employees’ work and preventing them from accessing our facilities is a clear violation of our policies, and completely unacceptable behavior. After refusing multiple requests to leave the premises, law enforcement was engaged to remove them to ensure office safety,"" the statement said. ""We have so far concluded individual investigations that resulted in the termination of employment for 28 employees, and will continue to investigate and take action as needed,"" it added. The protests were led by No Tech for Apartheid, a group of tech workers who have been demanding Amazon and Google drop their Project Nimbus, which is a joint $1.2 billion contract providing the Israeli government and military with cloud infrastructure, artificial intelligence services and data centers.No Tech for Apartheid said that the workers had engaged in a “peaceful sit-in and refusing to leave did not damage property or threaten other workers” and that Google had fired them “indiscriminately.” “This excuse to avoid confronting us and our concerns directly, and attempt to justify its illegal, retaliatory firings, is a lie,” it said in a statement late Wednesday, accusing the company of valuing its contract with the Israeli government more than its employees.Google issued a stern warning to its employees, with the company’s vice president of global security, Chris Rackow, saying, “If you’re one of the few who are tempted to think we’re going to overlook conduct that violates our policies, think again,” according to an internal memo obtained by CNBC.The company also said its work ""is not directed at highly sensitive, classified, or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services.”“Google Cloud supports numerous governments around the world in countries where we operate, including the Israeli government, with our generally available cloud computing services,” a Google spokesperson told CNBC on Wednesday evening.The Israeli prime minister's office and the Israel Defense Forces did not immediately respond to requests for comment from NBC News.The workers were also protesting labor conditions at the company — saying the contract was affecting “health and safety on the job” — and what they said was Google’s disregard “for the well-being of our Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim colleagues  facing  Google-enabled racism, discrimination, harassment, and censorship.”The project has become a “major health & safety workplace conditions issue,” with many employees quitting after having cited “mental health consequences of working at a company that is using their labor to enable a genocide,” the group said in a statement posted Wednesday on  Medium .“On a personal level, I am opposed to Google taking any military contracts — no matter which government they’re with or what exactly the contract is about,” Cheyne Anderson, a Google Cloud software engineer based in Washington, told CNBC on Wednesday.Anderson was one of the nine workers arrested across the country Tuesday, with some of the arrests streamed live on Twitch.Four people were arrested for “trespassing” inside Google’s New York office, a New York police spokesperson told NBC News on Wednesday.

"Chloe Melas,Alex Sherman, CNBC","As he faces a mountain of legal woes, former WWE leader Vince McMahon is traveling, eating out and keeping in touch with friends and associates — including former President Donald Trump.McMahon resigned as executive chairman of World Wrestling Entertainment’s parent company almost  three months ago  after a former employee, Janel Grant, accused him in  a bombshell lawsuit  of sexual abuse and trafficking. He denied the allegations. McMahon, 78, is also facing a  federal criminal investigation , although he hasn’t been charged.NBC News and CNBC talked to 11 people familiar with McMahon and WWE about how he’s been spending his time — and how the global brand he built over more than four decades is moving on without him. These people, including close personal associates and company insiders, declined to be named, citing ongoing legal cases and the confidential nature of internal corporate communications.Multiple WWE insiders said he hasn’t had any contact with company leaders and figureheads since he resigned. Mark Shapiro, the operating chief of WWE parent company TKO Group Holdings,  said in March  that McMahon “doesn’t work for the company, doesn’t come into the office, and he’s not coming back to the company.”That also means McMahon hasn’t talked to his son-in-law, WWE creative chief and former superstar Paul “Triple H” Levesque, or daughter, Stephanie McMahon-Levesque, regarding company matters, sources said. While she introduced WWE’s WrestleMania event earlier this month, McMahon-Levesque, who worked beside her father for more than 20 years and played roles in storylines, currently has no involvement with the company, according to people familiar with the matter. Levesque and McMahon-Levesque declined to comment through a spokesperson, as did a WWE representative. McMahon is nonetheless indelibly linked with the wrestling outfit, which he bought from his father 42 years ago. Still, he seems to have moved on, according to multiple sources. McMahon has kept up his other routines, and it’s as if he’s unfazed by his legal fights, two sources said.For instance, on an afternoon in late March, McMahon returned on a private plane to the United States from the sunny Turks and Caicos Islands -- but he wasn’t alone, according to a person close to him. He had with him seven kittens and a puppy, all of which he brought back to be adopted by his friends, this person added. “If anything, he’s enjoying life,” said the person, who added that McMahon had also taken a trip to Italy. Jessica Rosenberg, an attorney for McMahon, declined to comment regarding the aspects of the former WWE chief’s life reported in this article. In an emailed statement Tuesday, however, she criticized Grant’s suit: “The lawsuit’s claims are false, defamatory and entirely without merit. We intend to vigorously defend Mr. McMahon and are confident that he will be vindicated.”<h2>Life amid litigation</h2>The details of McMahon’s life after his WWE reign present a stark contrast to Grant’s accusations, which paint a graphic portrait of a violent and controlling man. In the federal lawsuit, filed Jan. 25, Grant’s attorneys said that she was “the victim of physical and emotional abuse, sexual assault and trafficking at WWE,” naming McMahon and former WWE executive John Laurinaitis. Both men have denied the accusations in the suit. The lawsuit also named WWE as a defendant. WWE and its parent company, TKO, have said that they take Grant’s allegations “very seriously.” “Vince McMahon raped, trafficked and physically assaulted Janel Grant as part of his decades-long normalization of treating women within the WWE as objects. He might have thought that Janel would just walk away, but that wishful thinking couldn’t be further from the case,” Ann Callis, an attorney for Grant, said in a statement Wednesday. “Every day we are focused on adding to our mountain of evidence, speaking with other victims, hiring renowned experts on sex trafficking/coercive control and preparing to vociferously litigate this case.”Federal investigators seized a phone from McMahon and have been trying to determine whether federal law was broken in the conduct surrounding Grant’s allegations,  NBC News reported in February . WWE had  disclosed last summer  that investigators served McMahon with a  federal grand jury subpoena  and executed a search warrant in July.McMahon is cooperating with authorities, according to one of the people close to him. McMahon believes officials won’t bring any charges against him and that Grant’s civil case will be settled out of court, said a person close to the former wrestling executive.Nicholas Biase, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, declined to comment.A spokesperson for Grant’s attorneys said that there have been absolutely no settlement talks with McMahon.While his legal battles persist, McMahon is often ferried by a private driver from his posh Connecticut home to Manhattan, according to one of the sources close to him. There, he eats with friends at restaurants such as the old-school Italian spot Il Tinello East on 46th Street, sees his longtime barber for biweekly haircuts and works with his personal trainer multiple times a week, the source said.  Two other sources, however, say McMahon has otherwise been “quite guarded” and often on the phone with his lawyers to map out plans since Grant’s lawsuit was made public.<h2>Staying in touch</h2>McMahon has also talked to Trump, according to two of the people close to the wrestling impresario. The two billionaires have been in touch regularly, according to a person close to McMahon, although it isn’t clear what they’ve discussed.Trump and the McMahon family go way back: The former president hosted two WrestleMania events in Atlantic City in the late 1980s, engaged in a wrestling “feud” with McMahon in 2007 and is a member of the WWE Hall of Fame. Linda McMahon, McMahon’s wife, served as the Small Business Administration’s head in Trump’s Cabinet, led a pro-Trump super PAC and is now on the board of the publicly traded Trump Media and Technology Group.In 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that McMahon  paid $5 million  in previously unrecorded expenses to the since-dissolved Donald J. Trump Foundation during two of the years Trump appeared on WWE programming.Trump, who’s running for a second term as president, has also been  accused of sexual assault  and is facing his own costly pile of civil and criminal legal troubles, including four separate indictments. Trump has denied wrongdoing in his various cases, pleading not guilty in each criminal proceeding, including a  New York trial  that started Monday. Another person close to McMahon said that the two men don’t discuss their legal problems and that Trump doesn’t provide legal advice.Hours after the publication of this story, a spokesperson for McMahon pushed back.“Mr. McMahon has not been ‘staying in touch’ or ‘been in touch regularly’ with former President Trump. He has spoken with Mr. Trump once in the past several years and that was for about a minute or so after Mr. McMahon’s back surgery. Other than that, there have been no communications between the two,” the spokesperson said.A representative for Trump declined to comment.Since he resigned, McMahon has been in touch with Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and John Cena, sources said. Johnson and Cena, both Hollywood superstars, are two of WWE’s biggest success stories.Publicly, Johnson has  thanked TKO and WWE executives  regarding his addition to the TKO board earlier this year. In February, Cena  told the radio host Howard Stern  that “the whole thing is super unfortunate and it sucks,” while noting that he loves McMahon and has a “great relationship” with him. “But in the same breath,” he added at the time, “I’m also a big advocate of accountability.”Cena and Johnson are both represented by the William Morris Endeavor agency, which is part of Endeavor Group — the majority owner of TKO.A spokesperson for Johnson declined to comment. A representative for Cena didn’t respond to requests for comment. <h2>WWE in transition</h2>This isn’t the first time WWE has had to contend with controversy stemming from its former longtime leader. McMahon  was acquitted  of federal criminal charges in the early 1990s related to the steroid scandal that engulfed the wrestling world at the time. In 2022,  he briefly stepped down  as WWE’s leader after the Journal reported that he  paid millions of dollars to multiple women  to cover up his alleged extramarital affairs. The Journal also reported that other women had come forward with  sexual misconduct allegations . WWE amended its financial reports to reflect the payments. McMahon denied all wrongdoing. His daughter helped take over leadership of the company in the interim, but McMahon-Levesque resigned when her father, who owned a controlling stake in WWE,  returned in early 2023 . McMahon then engineered a deal to merge the company with Endeavor Group’s UFC to form TKO. Longtime Hollywood super agent Ari Emanuel is the CEO of both Endeavor and TKO. That deal,  announced in April 2023 , made McMahon the executive chairman of the new company, and he gave up majority control of WWE. At the time, he told CNBC he wouldn’t be “in the weeds” with creative decisions but he would weigh in on big decisions. That marked a big shift for McMahon. His family has been in the business dating back to the early 20th century. After buying the company from his father, who was known as  “Vince Sr.,”  the younger McMahon then employed flamboyant superstars such as Hulk Hogan and the Rock, staging glitzy pay-per-view events like WrestleMania, to build it into an international sensation. And while WWE is still defined in part by the family, McMahon’s daughter and son-in-law are publicly attempting to push the brand into the future.  At WrestleMania 40, held earlier this month in Philadelphia, McMahon-Levesque surprised the crowd with an appearance and hailed her husband’s leadership. “Every Wrestlemania is special for its own reason, but I think WrestleMania 40 might be the one I’m most proud of, because this is the first WrestleMania of the Paul Levesque era,”  she said . (Linda McMahon joined her daughter backstage, according to  an Instagram photo  posted by wrestling star Charlotte Flair.) Levesque himself proclaimed a “new era” for WWE. It was a significant moment for the brand, coming during the first WrestleMania since the Grant lawsuit -- and it’s the first one under TKO’s management. Still, some rank-and-file WWE employees have griped that the company hasn’t done more to address the situation, according to an insider. After McMahon quit, Shapiro told a global town hall for both TKO and Endeavor employees “in no uncertain terms” that the former wrestling boss wouldn’t return, according to another insider. Shapiro also assured employees that Levesque and WWE President Nick Khan have his support, this person said. Otherwise, WWE is more relaxed since McMahon resigned in January, sources said. When McMahon was still running things, he would come in late in the afternoon and often stay until around midnight or beyond, two current employees said. (His office at WWE headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut, is unoccupied but otherwise intact, according to an executive, who called it “spooky.”) He had a reputation for being capricious and quick to fire employees, which generated fear and created a chilling effect, according to sources. Now there’s more levity and freedom to make a mistake or suggest an idea, some employees said.The current leadership operates more conventionally, giving underperforming employees a standard progress report and opportunities to improve before taking action, they added. Some McMahon loyalists remain, but one employee said: “WWE is actually a really great place to work, and Vince distracted from that. It’s been much better since he left.” Another said: “People feel like they’re on steadier ground.”The company, meanwhile, is charting its post-McMahon course with the help of lucrative media rights deals. In September, WWE signed a $1.4 billion deal with NBC News’ parent company, NBCUniversal, for domestic rights to “Friday Night SmackDown.” In January, it inked a 10-year, $5 billion pact with Netflix to move its flagship “Raw” show and other programs to the streaming giant next year. WWE announced both agreements after it became part of TKO and McMahon ceded much of his official control over the brand.There’s yet another sign suggesting that McMahon’s distance from WWE is more than temporary: He has sold  hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of shares  in TKO since November, a sizable chunk of those sales coming after he resigned in January. That’s different from when he briefly stepped down in 2022.  “This time, it’s like, OK, now, it’s  over -over,” one of the insiders said.A version of this story was published on  CNBC.com .",2024-04-17 20:49:00 PM EEST,NBC,"Vince McMahon's life after WWE: Kittens, vacations and staying in touch with Trump",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ince-mcmahons-post-wwe-life-trump-connections-legal-woes-travel-rcna147613
"Kaetlyn Liddy,Angela Yang,Doha Madani,Rebecca Cohen,Saba Hamedy","<h2>Vinyl industry rep says pandemic-era manufacturing bottlenecks have eased</h2>""The Tortured Poets Department"" is set to be released in special-edition ""ghost""-colored vinyl, available both directly through Swift's website and exclusively at Target.  During the pandemic, that might have alarmed vinyl record buyers. As vinyl plants shuttered and employees were sidelined, vinyl production ground to a halt, causing reports of weekslong backlogs and orders going unfulfilled outright. But in an interview with NBC News on Friday, Dustin Blocker, president of the Vinyl Records Manufacturing Association, said those issues have been resolved and that suppliers now have more than enough capacity to handle any orders coming their way, including massive ones like Swift's.<h2>Jack Antonoff is sharing BTS pics</h2>Jack Antonoff is giving Swifties what they want: more content.The Bleachers frontman, who is also Swift’s longtime collaborator and friend, shared pictures of Swift and collaborators on the album,  including Florence Welch .<h2>The acting U.S. secretary of labor has a question for Taylor</h2>Acting U.S. Labor Department Secretary Julie Su has a key question for Taylor Swift and her ""Tortured Poets Department"":""Is this department unionized?"" she  wrote in a post on X .Su, 55, has served as acting secretary since March 2023; she has faced stumbling blocks to being confirmed full time for the role  over her perceived pro-union bias .<h2>Destin celebrates Swift shoutout</h2>The city of Destin, Florida, is here for the Swiftie boost.Google searches  for the beach town shot up minutes after Swift’s “The Tortured Poets Department” was released.

They try to reinvent themselves, have a new identity, blend in.”It’s the same with heartbreak, she said.“I think when you go through a heartbreak, there’s a part of you that thinks, ‘I want a new name. I want a new life,’” she said.Or perhaps in Swift’s case — a new era?Read more at TODAY.com.<h2>The double album appeared to avoid leaks</h2>The standard edition of ""The Tortured Poets Department"" is  said to have been leaked  ahead the album's release. The origin of the apparent leaks is unclear, but none of the songs on the extended ""anthology"" version of the album seem to have been compromised.Leaks of major artists' work sometimes occur when physical copies of the album arrive prematurely at record stores or department stores, before the tracks are released on streaming platforms.

""Downtown Lights,"" released in 1989, was the peak of The Blue Nile's commercial success in the U.S., with the song reaching  No. 10  on the Billboard American Modern Rock Tracks chart. 1989 is also Swift's birth year and the title of her fifth studio album.Known for their avoidance of publicity, The Blue Nile has released just four albums since forming in 1981.<h2>Fans share their theories and joy on social media</h2>It wouldn't be a new Taylor Swift album without fans wondering who it's about or decoding the names mentioned in each song. (Who is  Cassandra , Taylor?)That speculation will surely continue, but now that the album is out, fans can't believe their luck.

An anthology of new works that reflect events, opinions and sentiments from a fleeting and fatalistic moment in time — one that was both sensational and sorrowful in equal measure.""This period of the author’s life is now over, the chapter closed and boarded up. There is nothing to avenge, no scores to settle once wounds have healed. And upon further reflection, a good number of them turned out to be self-inflicted.""This writer is of the firm belief that our tears become holy in the form of ink on a page. Once we have spoken our saddest story, we can be free of it.""And then all that’s left behind is the tortured poetry.""<h2>To sleep or stream? Swifties question staying up even later</h2>Can you wait until the morning to listen to the 15 extra songs on Swift's anthology? If you answered no, you're not alone. Online, fans joked that they didn't expect to get this little shut eye.Among the fans: Gen Z Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla.""I got votes in the morning. Do I sleep or listen"" he  wrote .

That now makes it Swift's longest album, edging ahead of  ""Red (Taylor's Version)"" by just one track.<h2>A list of all 15 of the extra 'Anthology' songs</h2><h2>Surprise: a double album!</h2>""The Tortured Poets Department"" is a secret DOUBLE album.In a 2 a.m. ET surprise, Swift announced an extra 15 songs.""I’d written so much tortured poetry in the past 2 years and wanted to share it all with you, so here’s the second installment of TTPD: The Anthology,"" she  wrote on X . ""15 extra songs. And now the story isn’t mine anymore… it’s all yours.""<h2>It's 2 a.m.</h2>Now what, Taylor?<h2>ICYMI: Swift's powerhouse publicist Tree Paine gets profiled by WSJ</h2>Swift's longtime publicist, Tree Paine, whom many fans know by name, was the subject of a lengthy  Wall Street Journal article  published Thursday ahead of the new album's release. While she declined to be interviewed for the story, it delves into how she became one of the most powerful people in the entertainment industry since she joined Swift's camp in 2014. “There isn’t a publicist in NY, LA or Nashville that wouldn’t jump at an opportunity to work with someone as talented as Taylor Swift and her management team,” Paine said at the time,  according to the New York Post .Read the full story here.<h2>Couples are now wary of Swift's 'Lover' as a love song</h2>“Lover” — at least until recently — was widely received as one of Swift’s classic love songs. When the album of the same name came out in 2019, its title single was declared  first dance song material , or even a “ wedding waltz .”In the song, Swift paints a portrait of quiet intimacy. Her wild “Red” days, of thrilling romances with highs and lows and uncertainties in between, had settled into something steadier with one person, captured by a simple chorus: “You’re my, my, my, my lover.”But that interpretation is now in question, as Swift recasts some of her songs in a different light. Ahead of the release of “The Tortured Poets Department,”  she released five playlists on Apple Music , sorting old songs into groups inspired by the five stages of grief, or “heartbreak.”Read the full story here.  <h2>Aaron Dessner is credited as a songwriter on five of 16 tracks</h2>Dessner, who is a member of the bands The National and Big Red Machine, is one of two producers who worked on ""The Tortured Poets Department.""He's credited as a songwriter on five of the 16 tracks on the standard album. Dessner first collaborated with Swift on her eighth studio album, “Folklore,” for which he shared in the Grammy win for album of the year. He made several  guest appearances  with Swift on the U.S. leg of the Eras Tour, joining her onstage during the acoustic set for performances of songs they wrote together.<h2>Here's what some critics are saying in their reviews</h2>The critics have spoken. Here's a roundup of some of their takeaways on ""The Tortured Poets Department.""Billboard ’s Jason Lipshutz praised Swift’s boldness for releasing a “knowingly messy, wildly unguarded breakup album” at what’s arguably the peak of her career. It's more mature than her past heartbreak albums, he writes, and “not everyone will love it, but the ones who get it will adore it fiercely.”Variety ’s Chris Willman wrote that the album can serve as an “unapologetically dramatic” soundtrack to listeners’ own heartbreaks.Labeling it Swift’s most personal album yet,  Rolling Stone ’s Rob Sheffield described it as “the cathartic confession of a woman who thought she had adulthood — and adult romance — all figured out, only to find herself realizing she knows nothing.”And unlike on past albums, Swift doesn’t portray herself as a victim in this one, wrote the  Los Angeles Times ’ Mikael Wood. Instead, the album emanates “a proudly villainous energy as Swift embraces her messiest and most chaotic tendencies.”<h2>Jack Antonoff, Swift's longtime collaborator, posts love for album</h2>Antonoff, Swift’s longtime collaborator and friend, shared his love for the new album  on X .""Love this album more than I can say,"" wrote Antonoff, who worked on “The Tortured Poets Department” as a producer.Antonoff also co-wrote eight of the album's tracks.<h2>Swifties are starting to post reax on X</h2>In typical fashion after a Swift album drops, reactions from fans are pouring in online, and they TEND TO COME IN ALL CAPS. As any Swiftie will tell you, listening to new music from the artist always proves to be a collective emotional experience. <h2>Spotify appears to be holding it together (so far)</h2>The last time Swift debuted a brand-new album, Spotify crashed. No major issues so far this time around.Shoutout to the engineers and people behind the scenes who are probably working overtime to make sure Swifties don't panic.<h2>We have a new countdown</h2>Don’t go to bed yet! Taylor Swift’s Instagram page is displaying a new countdown to 2 a.m. ET. This wasn't on the timetable ...<h2>Swift releases statement after album drop</h2>In her first social media post after “The Tortured Poets Department” was released, Swift shared a statement about the album online.These songs reflect her experiences from a moment in time that was equally “sensational and sorrowful,” she wrote, adding that it is a chapter now closed.“Once we have spoken our saddest story, we can be free of it,” Swift wrote. “And then all that’s left behind is the tortured poetry.”<h2>Who is Clara Bow?</h2>The 16th and final track on the album is named for Clara Bow, one of the leading lights of Hollywood’s silent era. Bow, unlike a lot of stars from the 1920s, managed to successfully pivot to roles in talkies by the end of the decade. She co-starred in “Wings” (1927), which today is probably best known as the first movie to win the Oscar for best picture.I’m not a Swiftie, so I don’t have much insight into how Taylor’s music connects to Bow’s acting career — but I’m curious how this track will be interpreted by the die-hards.<h2>The album is here</h2>BRB, we’re busy listening with the rest of y’all. <h2>You can now choose a Swift-themed chat for your Instagram DMs</h2>Instagram users can now set their direct message conversations to a new chat theme inspired by “The Tortured Poets Department.”<h2>Bars, venues hold special Swift parties</h2>On the eve of Swift’s album drop, event venues across the country (and around the world) hosted release parties so Swifties could get their first listen of the “The Tortured Poets Department” on the dance floor.At Pianos in New York, music from across Swift’s discography will play until the new album drops at midnight. Attendees are encouraged to come in themed outfits and friendship bracelets, and the bar will be serving Swift-inspired cocktails.In Los Angeles, El Cid is hosting a listening party complete with fan-made merch, giveaways and a themed wall for photos. Attendees can also expect performances from drag queen Jade Jolie, who appeared in Swift’s “You Need to Calm Down” music video.Several Swiftie-themed events are also being held across the Washington, D.C., area, according to The Washington Post, which compiled a  list .<h2>A Swiftie mom and daughter are hosting their own album party</h2>Kristie Gilmore, 36, is ready to celebrate with her daughter, who was born shortly after Swift's “1989” album and has been a Swiftie ever since.Gilmore decorated her Boston-area apartment with balloons, signs and stickers in the color palette of “The Tortured Poets Department.” She sprinkled the table with handmade confetti of the album’s logo and made TTPD-themed “membership cards” for themselves and each of her daughter’s friends.“They’ve been counting down since Taylor announced this album,” Gilmore said, adding, “They’re just hanging out, having a dance party. They’re gonna try to stay up till midnight and listen to it.”<h2>What are the track lengths?</h2>The average track length on “The Tortured Poets Department” is 4 minutes and 4 seconds, making it the third longest album across Swift’s discography. The longest song is “But Daddy I Love Him,” which clocks in at 5 minutes and 40 seconds.“I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can)” is the shortest song, at 2 minutes and 36 seconds.<h2>Travis Kelce shared his early thoughts about the album</h2>Ahead of the Super Bowl, Swift's boyfriend, Travis Kelce, the star tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs,  weighed in  on the new album. “I have heard some of it, yes. It is unbelievable,”  Kelce said . “I can’t wait for her to shake up the world when it finally drops.”The  couple , who have  become the internet's favorite love story , were most recently spotted at  Coachella 's first weekend. <h2>Taylor Swift beat reporter speaks to NBC's Hallie Jackson</h2>USA Today’s  Taylor Swift reporter , Bryan West, spoke with NBC News about the album drop and all the Easter eggs being spotted by fans. <h2>Swift's music is back on TikTok despite UMG dispute</h2>Some songs that Swift fans know “All Too Well” returned to TikTok this month, months after they were removed.The songs were among the many tracks Universal Music Group pulled off TikTok after the label and the platform  failed to reach an agreement  this year. (UMG has no relationship to NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News.)UMG, known as one of the “Big Three” global music companies, cleared its music from TikTok in late January, saying it was doing so because of a lack of compensation for artists and songwriters. TikTok previously fired back at UMG, accusing the company of putting “their own greed above the interests of artists and songwriters.”Read the full story here.  <h2>The economics of 'The Tortured Poets Department'</h2>Die-hard Taylor Swift fans will be spending a pretty penny on her latest album release as she releases four variants of the album with one exclusive track each.Each variant of “The Tortured Poets Department” is named after the bonus song found at the end of the album: “The Manuscript,” “The Bolter,” “The Albatross” and “The Black Dog.” If a fan wanted to collect them all, the minimum for $13.99 CDs at a store would cost at least $55.96 before taxes.Longtime Swifties are already familiar with her tendency to provide deluxe editions, as anyone who was around for her original “1989” release can recall the Target exclusive that included three bonus tracks and three voice memos recorded by Swift. Her “Midnights” release included a Target exclusive track that was added to streaming only months later, and in May she released a new song on “Midnights (The Late Night Edition).” But this is the first time Swift has put an exclusive song on each individual variant, with no clear timeline for when they might be added to streaming. <h2>2024: The year of Post Malone and the pop girlies</h2>Fresh off of a collab with Beyoncé on ""LEVII'S JEANS"" from her now-famed ""Cowboy Carter,"" Post Malone finds himself on another major release of 2024: Swift's ""The Tortured Poets Department.""He joins Swift on the album's first song, ""Fortnight."" Swift announced that ""Fortnight"" would be the album's lead single and the song for which she is releasing a music video 8 o'clock tomorrow night. ""I’ve been such a huge fan of Post because of the writer he is, his musical experimentation and those melodies he creates that just stick in your head forever,"" Swift wrote on social media. ""I got to witness that magic come to life firsthand when we worked together on Fortnight.""While best known for more rap-focused songs, Post Malone is clearly making the rounds in the pop music scene, having also recently collaborated with Noah Kahan on ""Dial Drunk."" But his back-to-back appearances on arguably two of the biggest albums from pop artists this year raise the questions: Is Post Malone becoming a pop girlie? Is he just having a moment? Or is it all of the above?<h2>There's a book about Swift's impact headed to bookshelves</h2>Rolling Stone writer and music historian Rob Sheffield's book ""Heartbreak Is the National Anthem: How Taylor Swift Reinvented Pop Music"" will debut Nov. 12.He's expected to dive further into Swift’s music and fan connection.<h2>Swifties are celebrating with their own listening parties</h2>Many Swifties are sharing their elaborate party setups online as they prepare to celebrate the album release at home.Karen Rothdeutsch, 25, has decked out her bedroom in upstate New York with “The Tortured Poets Department”-themed decorations, complete with a platter of homemade cupcakes decorated to match Swift’s various vinyl variants.“I just made my space a little more immersive for my first listen,” Rothdeutsch told NBC News. “I’ll be sitting in my bed with a box of tissues and a notebook, writing down my thoughts and probably checking into Twitter every so often to see what everybody’s thinking about it.”She said she procured the decorations over the course of several weeks, but the whole setup cost her less than $100. While she decorates on a budget, she said she did splash out on the vinyl variants and collector’s edition CDs.<h2>Swift's new album is already breaking a Spotify record</h2>Spotify  said on X  that the “The Tortured Poets Department” became the most pre-saved album countdown page in the streaming service’s history.Since its launch on March 28, TTPD's  countdown page  has ticked down to the album’s drop, now just hours away.<h2>Was Swift's Grammys dress a  'Fortnight' Easter egg?</h2>The white gown Swift wore to the 2024 Grammys, where she announced ""The Tortured Poets Department,"" appears to have been an Easter egg. Swift appears to be wearing a very similar dress in the  teaser  for the ""Fortnight (feat. Post Malone)"" music video, which will debut 8 p.m. ET tomorrow.Swift was also pictured hugging Post Malone at the ceremony. Some fans online  pointed out a similar shot  of the two singers that appears in the teaser for the music video.<h2>Swift drops 'Fortnight' music video teaser</h2>Swift blessed fans with a teaser for “Fortnight (feat. Post Malone),""  the album's first single. ""At this hearing, I stand before my fellow members of The Tortured Poets Department with a summary of my findings. Album tonight. Fortnight music video tomorrow at 8pm et,"" Swift wrote in a  post on X , which was accompanied by a short video clip.The black-and-white teaser gave a sneak peak of the visuals for the music video. It's a combination of dramatic period gowns and a bleak medical setting in this supercut that is reminiscent of ""Poor Things,"" which Swift's longtime friend Emma Stone recently  won the best actress Oscar  for.Swift had announced she'd be dropping a music video at 8 p.m. ET tomorrow by sharing a “TTPD Timetable”  on her Instagram  page this week. <h2>Merch is here — and already selling out</h2>Hours before the album’s release, themed merchandise for “The Tortured Poets Department” is now  available to order  online.The merch drop includes hoodies, crewnecks and gold jewelry branded with the album’s logo. A display case for the album vinyls seemingly sold out within minutes.<h2>ICYMI: The Eras Tour concert film is on Disney+</h2>In case you need something to do as you count down to the new album, “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” is on Disney+. Swift  announced  the film would be available for streaming in February. The film features all songs from the three Los Angeles tour dates during which it was filmed at SoFi Stadium. They include “cardigan,” as well as four additional acoustic surprise songs from the tour: “I Can See You,” “Maroon,” “You Are in Love” and “Death by a Thousand Cuts.”<h2>Swifties online are freaking out over purported ‘leaks’</h2>The internet was at it again this week, with some online circulating what they said were leaks of Swift's new album. It is unclear from where and when the apparent leaks originated, but  one Reddit thread  is already filled with commentary. As early as Tuesday, ""taylor swift leak"" appeared to be blocked from searches on X. Instead, when a user tried to search the phrase, a blank page popped up with the message, ""Something went wrong. Try reloading."" <h2>The secret message has been decoded</h2>The sixth and final word of the secret message, “mortem,” was revealed today, hidden in the lyrics of the song “Begin Again.” The complete secret message is: “We hereby conduct this post mortem.”In a collaboration with Apple Music, Swift sorted some of her existing songs into  thematic playlists , along with audio messages from her. The messages seemed to confirm some fans’ theories that the playlists mirrored the five stages of grief — denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance — indicating that the new album may grapple with grief or loss. Swift later  used a song  from each playlist to reveal a hidden word on Apple Music every day leading up to the release of “The Tortured Poets Department.”<h2>Swift sets fans loose on an international puzzle</h2>Swifties had a big day yesterday after murals with QR codes were unveiled in cities around the world, including Mexico City, Paris and Chicago. Fans stumbled upon the murals, which Swift had not announced, and scanned them to find a link to a YouTube Shorts video. Every mural had a unique code that led to a different video, each revealing a new letter as part of a word puzzle. Fans came together online to help decode the puzzle, which seemed to hint at the new album's first track, because it spelled out ""for a fortnight.""<h2>Swifties in Los Angeles flock to Spotify pop-up library</h2>Many Los Angeles Swifties celebrated the new album with a pop-up library installation in partnership with Spotify. The three-day event, which runs through today at The Grove, featured a sneak peek at some of the album's lyrics.Fans posted videos of themselves lined up for hours to get a glimpse at the installation.A manuscript was front and center at the installation, revealing  new lyrics  periodically as the pages were turned over the course of three days. Many fans online tried to identify other  potential Easter eggs  in the pop-up library, such as a bust of a peace sign, quill and fountain pens and a globe that appeared to be pointing to Florida, the name of a track on the album.<h2>Why is the album called 'The Tortured Poets Department'?</h2>Fans were quick to note that “The Tortured Poets Department” is the longest title for a Taylor Swift album by a large margin, a distinction previously held by her third album, ""Speak Now."" Before ""TTPD,"" ""Speak Now"" was her only album title consisting of more than one word.Speculation surrounding the new album and its uncharacteristic title has primarily revolved around Swift’s  2023 breakup  with British actor Joe Alwyn after their six-year relationship.After the album announcement, a  2022 Variety interview  between Alwyn and Paul Mescal resurfaced on X. The pair revealed in the interview that they were both members of a WhatsApp group chat titled the Tortured Man Club, prompting some fans to  draw parallels  between Alwyn and Swift’s upcoming album.The true meaning of “The Tortured Poets Department” remains to be seen, but the album's rollout has featured references to famous poems like Charles Baudelaire’s “The Albatross,” among other literary references.<h2>Clues keep coming</h2>Speculation continues to grow over clues for lyrics, song titles and the album’s first music video.<h2>Not much from Miss Swift so far</h2>It's been a notably quiet rollout for ""The Tortured Poets Department."" No themed Instagram grid overhaul, no lead singles, not even a cryptic calendar leading Swifties on wild goose chases for potential Easter eggs. A week before the release, Taylor Swift was  rocking out at Coachella  instead of feeding her fans who are desperate for a hint of what's to come. Aside from a hand-painted QR code on the side of a building in Chicago, a planned exhibit at The Grove in Los Angeles in partnership with Spotify and a quick video released Tuesday that appears to leave the ""Midnights"" era in the dust as viewers tour The Tortured Poets Department, Swift has been silent on what we can expect.In the  video , posted to her Instagram account, we did get a glimpse of a schedule that only showed release day, and on it, the promise of a music video on Friday at 8 p.m. ET. Fourteen tick marks beneath led some to think the music video could be for the 14th track on the album, or for the leading song, ""Fortnight,"" since a fortnight is 14 days.Swifties believing in the latter theory proved to be correct.

Daysia Tolentino,"An editor for National Public Radio resigned Wednesday just days after he inflamed the ongoing culture war about mainstream media with an essay about what he considers the news outlet’s liberal leanings.Uri Berliner, who was a senior business editor,  wrote an essay  for the right-leaning online publication The Free Press in which he said he believes NPR is losing the public’s trust. NPR, a nonprofit radio network, has an “absence of viewpoint diversity,” he wrote in the essay, which was published April 9. It “has always had a liberal bent,” but now an “open-minded spirit no longer exists within NPR,” he wrote.  The essay triggered a wave of scrutiny of NPR from conservatives, some of whom responded to it with calls to defund the news organization, which receives federal funding through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. NPR says on  its website  that federal funding is “essential” to NPR but that “less than 1% of NPR’s annual operating budget comes in the form of grants from CPB and federal agencies and departments.”In a resignation statement on X,  Berliner briefly elaborated  on the reason for his departure, which came days after NPR reported that it had  suspended him for five days  without pay following the op-ed’s release.  NPR’s chief business editor, Pallavi Gogoi, had told Berliner about its requirement to secure approval before he appeared in outside media, according to NPR’s report.“I don’t support calls to defund NPR,” Berliner wrote. “I respect the integrity of my colleagues and wish for NPR to thrive and do important journalism.  But I cannot work in a newsroom where I am disparaged by a new CEO whose divisive views confirm the very problems at NPR I cite in my Free Press essay.” Berliner did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. A representative for NPR said it “does not comment on individual personnel matters.” Berliner’s essay gained traction on X, with many conservatives homing in on his thoughts about NPR’s political makeup. He wrote: “In D.C., where NPR is headquartered and many of us live, I found 87 registered Democrats working in editorial positions and zero Republicans. None.” He also criticized NPR’s coverage, or lack thereof, of certain stories, such as the Mueller report, Hunter Biden’s laptop, the origins of Covid-19 and systemic racism following the murder of George Floyd.High-profile supporters of Berliner’s essay, including former President Donald Trump and X owner Elon Musk, shared criticism of NPR and its CEO, Katherine Maher. “NO MORE FUNDING FOR NPR, A TOTAL SCAM! EDITOR SAID THEY HAVE NO REPUBLICANS, AND IS ONLY USED TO ‘DAMAGE TRUMP.’ THEY ARE A LIBERAL DISINFORMATION MACHINE. NOT ONE DOLLAR!!!” Trump  wrote on Truth Social  on April 10.Musk  wrote on X  that the “head of NPR hates the Constitution of the USA” in response to a clip of Maher discussing the challenges in fighting disinformation and honoring the First Amendment right to free speech.Meanwhile, some journalists at NPR pushed back against Berliner’s accusations.“Morning Edition” co-host Steve Inskeep  shared his take  in a post on his Substack newsletter , saying he believes Berliner failed to “engage anyone who had a different point of view.”“Having been asked, I answered: my colleague’s article was filled with errors and omissions,” he wrote, adding, “The errors do make NPR look bad, because it’s embarrassing that an NPR journalist would make so many.”NPR’s chief news executive, Edith Chapin, also denied Berliner’s assessment of the newsroom in a memo to staff members,  according to NPR .“We’re proud to stand behind the exceptional work that our desks and shows do to cover a wide range of challenging stories,” she wrote. “We believe that inclusion — among our staff, with our sourcing, and in our overall coverage — is critical to telling the nuanced stories of this country and our world.”Maher also  said Monday in a statement to NPR : “In America everyone is entitled to free speech as a private citizen. What matters is NPR’s work and my commitment as its CEO: public service, editorial independence, and the mission to serve all of the American public. NPR is independent, beholden to no party, and without commercial interests.”",2024-04-18 01:12:00 AM EEST,NBC,Senior NPR editor resigns after accusing outlet of liberal bias,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/npr-editor-uri-berliner-resigns-after-accusing-outlet-liberal-bias-rcna148258
"Dan Mangan, CNBC","Trump Media  is making a point of telling its  shareholders  how to prevent their stock from being loaned to  short sellers  — who bet the price of the shares will drop.The short-selling-prevention tips posted Wednesday on Trump Media’s  website  come as its  DJT  stock has sharply fallen in price since it began being public  trading  on March 26 — and as short sellers have taken a keen interest in the owner of the  Truth Social  app despite relatively high fees to finance such trades.Trump Media’s share  price  rose sharply on Wednesday, by more than 15%, its closing price of $26.40 was still a whopping 63% lower than the price it opened at on March 26.The stock slumped by 20% last week alone, and then plummeted by more than 18% on Monday and another more than 14% on Tuesday.The share price Wednesday was nearly 46% lower than its closing price on April 1, the same day Trump Media disclosed it had booked a $58 million loss for 2023, with just $4.1 million in revenue for that year.Former President  Donald Trump  is by far the biggest shareholder in Trump Media, owning nearly 60% of its shares. And his 78.75 million shares could soon grow by 36 million shares if DJT’s price stays above $17 per share in the coming days due to an earnout provision in the merger deal that took the company public.But Trump, who is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, and Trump Media since late March seen billions of dollars in share value evaporate from share price declines.On Wednesday, following two straight days of sharp price drops, the company included a supplement to its frequently asked questions list on its website, which it detailed in an 8-K filing on Thursday morning with the  Securities and Exchange Commission .The supplement offers detailed instructions to shareholders on: ” How do I prevent my shares from being loaned for a short interest position?”Short selling is the practice of borrowing shares of a company’s stock, and then quickly selling those shares for a certain amount of money. The short seller then waits, hoping that the share price will drop over some period of time, so that they can then repurchase the same number of shares and give them back to the lender, pocketing the difference between what they first sold the shares for as profit after paying brokers’ fees.“For long-term shareholders who believe in the Company’s future, the Company is highlighting the following actions you can take with your brokerage firm to prevent the lending of your shares for short selling,” Trump Media said in its supplement to its FAQ Wednesday.The tips include holding DJT shares in a cash account at a brokerage firm as opposed to a margin account, “opting out of any securities lending program,” moving Trump Media shares to the company’s designated transfer agent, and transferring shares to a bank and “holding them in your retirement account.”The instructions include a helpful form letter that shareholder can send to their brokers.The letter says: “Please accept this written instruction to make sure that the following securities are held in my cash account only and accordingly are not available for any stock loan activities.”“I hereby expressly opt-out of any securities lending programs and instruct you to not loan out any of my shares,” the letter says, before a section that the sender can fill out with their number of shares.A spokeswoman for Trump Media did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the new instructions regarding preventing short selling.Short selling is particularly risky because it is markedly different than a “long position” in a stock — in which a person can only lose the amount of money they paid for shares if their price falls to zero.In contrast, a short position in a stock can in theory see its price rise without stopping, leaving the short seller responsible for paying exponentially more money to buy back the shares to return to the lender.Trump Media in its update FAQ nodded to that risk in noting that brokerage firms loan shares “to sophisticated and institutional investors” to do short sales. Brokers often insist that customers who do short sales with them are experienced investors, and have sufficient cash or collateral on hand that can insure that if the short trade goes bad they can cover their losses.Trump Media also pointed out that lending shares to short sellers can earn brokerage firms “an alternative source of revenue.”“If the price of the stock in fact decreases, then the brokerage firm and the sophisticated and institutional investors will have made a profit, while the ultimate retail investor has not,” Trump Media told its shareholders.”Only about 5 million shares of DJT have been available to short out of more than 136 million company shares. And much of the 5 million shares were already locked up in short positions earlier this month.But Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, told CNBC in early April, “What I’m hearing on the Street is that if [an amount] of stock becomes available, shorts are taking it down.”",2024-04-18 16:04:00 PM EEST,NBC,Trump Media tells shareholders how to block their DJT stock being loaned to short sellers,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/trump-media-tells-shareholders-block-djt-stock-loaned-short-sellers-rcna148357
Rob Wile,"The Federal Aviation Administration is instituting new rest rules for U.S. air traffic controllers to address fatigue issues that may be degrading air safety.Controllers will now be required to take 10 hours off between shifts and 12 hours off before a midnight shift. The mandate will take effect in 90 days, FAA Administrator Michael Whitaker said in a statement Friday.""In my first few months at the helm of the FAA, I toured air traffic control facilities around the country — and heard concerns about schedules that do not always allow controllers to get enough rest,"" he said. ""With the safety of our controllers and national airspace always top of mind for FAA, I took this very seriously — and we’re taking action."" In a statement following the release of the new mandate, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association said that while it appreciated the FAA's attempt to address the fatigue issue, it was alarmed that the agency did not coordinate the new rules with them. It also warned said the new rules could backfire given current staffing shortage issues. ""NATCA is concerned that with an already understaffed controller workforce, immediate application of the Administrator’s new rules may lead to coverage holes in air traffic facilities’ schedules,"" it said.  ""These holes may affect National Airspace System capacity. Requiring controllers to work mandatory overtime to fill those holes would increase fatigue and make the new policy nothing more than window dressing.""The new mandate comes amid heightened scrutiny of U.S. air safety. On Thursday, the FAA announced it was investigating  a near-miss incident  at Washington's Reagan International Airport. A string of near-miss incidents last year led acting Administrator Billy Nolen to  convene an emergency summit on U.S. air safety systems.   Whitaker, who took over as FAA chief in October, commissioned a study on fatigue within weeks of taking office. The subsequent 114-page report found, among other things, that sleep loss, especially in the context of night work and rotating shifts, ""engender known safety and performance decrements that can lead to errors, incidents, and accidents.""",2024-04-19 18:52:00 PM EEST,NBC,New FAA rest rules to address 'fatigue' issues with air traffic controllers,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/new-faa-rest-rules-address-fatigue-issues-air-traffic-controllers-rcna148572

"Diana Olick, CNBC","The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage crossed over 7% on April 1, according to  Mortgage News Daily , and it just kept going. It now sits right around 7.5%, the highest level since mid-November of last year.Rates hit their highest level in a few decades last October, causing home sales to grind to a halt. Builders jumped to buy down rates for their customers and managed to do better than existing home sellers.Rates then fell through mid-January to the mid-6% range and held there into February, causing a surge in home sales. But then they began rising again.“By mid-February, a pick-up in inflation reset expectations, putting mortgage rates back on an upward trend, and more recent data and comments from Fed Chair [Jerome] Powell have only underscored inflation concerns,” said Danielle Hale, chief economist for Realtor.com. “Sales data over the next few months is likely to reflect the impact of now-higher mortgage rates.”Even with rates higher, however, mortgage applications to purchase a home rose 5% last week compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s  seasonally adjusted index . Demand was still 10% lower than the same week one year ago, even with rates now 70 basis points higher than they were a year ago.“Despite these higher rates, application activity picked up, possibly as some borrowers decided to act in case rates continue to rise,” said Joel Kan, MBA’s chief economist.That may be short-lived, however, as affordability weakens even further. While there is more  supply on the market  now than there was a year ago, it is still at a very low level historically. That has caused homes to move faster as the competition increases. Anyone waiting for rates to drop significantly may be waiting for a while.“Recent economic data shows that the economy and job market remain strong, which is likely to keep mortgage rates at these elevated levels for the near future,” said Bob Broeksmit, MBA’s president and CEO.",2024-04-19 00:41:00 AM EEST,NBC,Mortgage rates are now at the highest level of the year and could still climb,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/mortgage-rates-highest-right-now-could-go-higher-rcna148478

J.J. McCorvey,"Car insurance costs are pretty brutal at the moment — they’re  up more than 22%  since this time last year. There’s plenty you can do to lower your bill, but  some of the best advice out there  still requires a certain amount of upfront cash.For example, paying your annual premium all in one go could eliminate the extra fees some insurers charge customers for paying month by month. But that may not be an option if your budget is tight and your premium has surged.Insurers have been playing catch-up since the pandemic, said Stephen Crewdson, senior director of insurance intelligence at J.D. Power. They were late to raise rates when auto prices were ticking up, and now their hikes are setting in even as vehicle prices cool. Nearly 14% of consumers reported shopping for new insurance last month, a  recent J.D. Power survey  found — the highest monthly rate since it started tracking the figure in 2020.“We should hopefully see these premium increases taper off as time goes by,” Crewdson said.In the meantime, there are still some ways to lower your bill this year. Here’s where to start.<h2>Shop widely for discounts</h2>Auto insurance customers this year are “gonna have to be more aggressive” to find savings, said Lee Baker, an Atlanta-based financial planner and founder of Apex Financial. “You might need to cast a wider net.”That means checking all the discounts on offer, starting with your current carrier. From military discounts to bundling opportunities, policyholders often leave money on the table simply by not picking up the phone. When J.D. Power surveys consumers, it finds many aren’t fully aware what savings are out there, Crewdson said.“Ask somebody at your insurer. If you have an agent, ask your agent,” he said. “If you don’t have an agent, call in to the insurer, visit the website, look at the app and look at what discounts they offer.”Experts also suggest considering the organizations in your orbit. Many professional and trade associations, alumni groups and even fraternity and sorority associations often negotiate discounts with insurers.But your employer may be the best place to start hunting for perks. “Your benefits package, at least for large employers — there’s a lot of little nuggets in there that people gloss over,” said Preston Cherry, founder of Concurrent Financial Planning in Green Bay, Wisconsin.While employers typically work with only a single insurer and any discounts probably won’t be drastic, experts said, they can help you start chipping away at your monthly costs.<h2>Take that defensive driving course</h2>Financial experts say this is one of the easiest strategies. Many insurance companies offer considerable savings when policyholders complete defensive driving courses — most of which are online — from organizations such as the  National Safety Council  or  Defensive Driving by IMPROV .“I always recommend taking defensive driving every year,” said Cherry. “The discount is worth it.”Carriers in at least 34 states and Washington, D.C., typically offer discounts of up to 10% for course completion,  according to I Drive Safely , a defensive driving course proctor.Many carriers also offer their own programs for good driving behavior — though some require agreeing to a measure of surveillance. Progressive’s Snapshot, for example, offers policyholders a mobile app or a plug-in device for their vehicles that track, among other things, your braking patterns and the times of day you get behind the wheel, then use that information to determine your discount eligibility.One caveat: Risky behavior can trigger a higher rate when it’s time to renew your policy, said Jude Boudreaux, a certified financial planner and partner at the Planning Center in New Orleans. But “if you’re trying to drive pretty conservatively and around town, using those can be a way to save some additional costs,” he said.For those who work remotely or don’t drive much, Boudreaux also suggests pay-per-mile plans. These also rely on mileage- and behavior-tracking devices that may entail privacy trade-offs but could be a boon for some. Nationwide’s SmartMiles program, for example, offers a low base rate plus a variable one that depends on mileage. And for periodic longer road trips, it counts only the first 250 miles per day.<h2>Check for family-friendly fine print</h2>For consumers with kids who drive or are about to start, there’s a lot to consider that can affect your bill.While it’s generally cheaper to add a teen driver to an existing policy or bundle than it is to buy a new one, repeated infractions (tickets, fender benders) can drive up your household’s costs, so weigh the trade-offs carefully.“Sometimes bringing them inside the bundled package works, sometimes not,” said Cherry. “That’s always a tricky one.”He advises starting any young drivers in your family on an inexpensive or mostly paid-off car. Since it has become  more expensive to repair vehicles  lately, consider how much cash you’re willing to risk on your kid’s behalf.“It’s really trying to save costs by placing them in a vehicle that’s not much to insure and counterbalances their inexperience risk level to insure,” Cherry said.Baker said academic achievements can also help trim your insurance costs. Many carriers offer “good student” discounts, typically for high-school or college students under age 25. Maintaining a B average or performing well on the SAT or ACT could net substantial savings. State Farm, for example, offers up to 30% off for high marks.“There’s no guarantee that a student with good grades won’t get behind the wheel and do something crazy,” Baker conceded, but insurers are betting — for better or worse — that “if they’re doing right in school, they’re probably less risky.”<h2>Trim the fat from your policy</h2>Sometimes savings are staring up at you from your current insurance plan, experts said. Check your policy for redundancies and areas of overlap, said Cherry. For example, if you pay for AAA roadside assistance, you may be able to shave similar coverage off your auto insurance policy. Some newer cars already include some form of roadside assistance, he added.A common tactic for lowering monthly premiums is to choose a policy with a higher deductible. Marcus Miller, a Jacksonville, Fla.-based financial planner at Mainstay Capital, urged caution here. Some clients, he said, “go in and just start slashing” line items from their policies and end up underinsured.Instead, it’s smart to first build up an emergency fund for a potentially high deductible — and then make the switch, he advised.Customers “could reasonably increase their deductible, as long as they have that cash set aside,” Miller said. “That will reduce their premium.”",2024-04-20 01:15:00 AM EEST,NBC,Car insurance rates are nuts right now.

"Michael Wayland, CNBC","The United Auto Workers said late Friday that Volkswagen employees in Chattanooga, Tennessee, have  overwhelmingly voted to join the union  — marking a major milestone for the labor organization and its first successful organizing drive of an automaker outside of  Detroit’s Big Three .Union organizing passed with 73% of the vote, or 2,628 workers, in support for the UAW, according to the National Labor Relations Board, which oversaw the election. A total of roughly 3,620, or about 84%, of the 4,326 eligible VW workers voted in the election, the NLRB said. Seven ballots were challenged and three were voided.“In a historic victory, an overwhelming majority of Volkswagen workers in Chattanooga, Tennessee, have voted to join the UAW,” the union  said in a release Friday night  before official results were released by the National Labor Relations Board, or NLRB. “While votes continue to be tallied, the outcome is clear: Volkswagen workers in Chattanooga are the first Southern autoworkers outside of the Big Three to win their union.”The NLRB still must certify the result, but barring any unexpected issues or challenges, the company is required to bargain in good faith with the union. The talks can be direct  or go first through a mediator.The sides have five business days to file objections to the election, according to the NLRB. If no objections are filed, the result will be certified.Volkswagen confirmed the UAW’s win in a release Friday night but offered little additional comment.“We will await certification of the results by the NLRB,”  the company said . “Volkswagen thanks its Chattanooga workers for voting in this election.”UAW leaders and supporters are expected to use the win as a launching point for the union’s unprecedented organizing  campaign of 13 automakers  in the U.S. following major contract wins last year with General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler parent Stellantis.President Joe Biden, who has heavily  supported organized labor and the UAW , congratulated the union on its “historic vote.”“Across the country, union members have logged major wins and large raises, including auto workers, actors, port workers, Teamsters, writers, warehouse and health care workers, and more. Together, these union wins have helped raise wages and demonstrate once again that the middle-class built America and that unions are still building and expanding the middle class for all workers,”  Biden said  in a statement.UAW President Shawn Fain and others saw this week’s vote as the union’s  best shot at organizing  the Volkswagen plant following the strikes and record contracts at the Detroit automakers. Those agreements included significant wage increase, reinstatement of cost-of-living adjustments and other benefits.The successful organizing drive comes days after six Republican governors of Southern states, including Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, released a joint statement  condemning the UAW’s push  to organize in their states.“We have worked tirelessly on behalf of our constituents to bring good-paying jobs to our states. These jobs have become part of the fabric of the automotive manufacturing industry. Unionization would certainly put our states’ jobs in jeopardy — in fact, in this year already, all of the UAW automakers have announced layoffs,”  the statement  said.The UAW previously failed to organize the Volkswagen plant in 2014 and 2019 as it faced greater outside political pressure and worker opposition. Workers rejected union membership by just 833 to 776 votes five years ago.The union will now set its sights on negotiating with VW. It will also look to an  anticipated organizing vote  of Mercedes-Benz workers at an SUV plant in Vance, Alabama.Workers at the facility earlier this month filed NLRB paperwork for a formal election to join the UAW. The vote for 5,200 workers will occur from May 13 through May 17, the NLRB announced Thursday.“The first thing you need to do to win is to believe that you can win,” Fain  told Mercedes-Benz workers  last month. “That this job can be better. That your life can be better. And that those things are worth fighting for. That is why we stand up. That’s why you’re here today. Because deep down, you believe it’s possible.”Fain previously vowed to move beyond the Big Three and expand to the  “Big Five or Big Six”  by the time its four-and-a-half-year contracts with the Detroit automakers expire in 2028.",2024-04-20 06:17:00 AM EEST,NBC,Volkswagen workers in Tennessee vote to join UAW in historic win for union,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/tennessee-volkswagen-workers-vote-join-uaw-historic-win-union-rcna148656
Patrick Smith,"Tesla is recalling almost 4,000 of its flagship Cybertrucks to fix a potentially dangerous  fault  with their accelerators' pedals.A  safety recall report  from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that 3,878 of the vehicles would be recalled for repair — including all those manufactured between Nov. 13, 2023, and April 4.""On affected vehicles, when high force is applied to the pad on the accelerator pedal, the pad may dislodge, which may cause the pedal to become trapped in the interior trim above the pedal,"" the report said.The recall adds to a run of bad news for Tesla. On Monday, the company  laid off 10% of its workforce  after disappointing company earnings showed  a decline in the number of cars it delivered  in the first three months of the year. Its stock price has fallen nearly 40% this year, and Tesla has  reportedly  stopped development of a cheaper vehicle option so it can  focus on self-driving robotaxis  —a move that has made some analysts more pessimistic about the company.The Cybertruck has done little to change that narrative. The futuristic-looking vehicle has generated plenty of buzz but also scrutiny over everything from its  safety  and  reliability  to its  sharp edges  and reports of  rust spots on its stainless steel body .The pedal problem was  raised on social media this week by one driver  who found that the vehicle was accelerating on its own after the accelerator became stuck to the floor when a rubber cover came loose.A TikTok video of Cybertruck owner Jose Martinez  illustrating the problem  has been shared more than 42,000 times and viewed more than 6 million times on X, the social network which, like Tesla, is owned by billionaire Elon Musk.The NHTSA said in its recall report that the fault was caused by ""residual lubricant (soap)"" which had been used to apply the rubber pad during the manufacturing process. It said ""Tesla will replace or rework the accelerator pedal assembly"" at no extra charge.The NHTSA said Tesla first received notice of a customer complaint about the accelerators on March 31, followed by a second on April 3. The report said that Tesla made the determination to voluntarily recall the vehicles on April 12.It also said Tesla has already begun to address the issue on vehicles in production or at delivery centers.",2024-04-19 15:26:00 PM EEST,NBC,"Tesla recalls almost 4,000 Cybertrucks over faulty accelerator",https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/tesla-ordered-recall-almost-4000-cybertrucks-faulty-accelerator-proble-rcna148526
Evan Bush,"In California’s boom-and-bust climate, Death Valley has offered some of the strangest scenes over the past few years. Some of the area’s perennial creosote bushes died back during a severe drought that hampered the region through 2022. Then torrential downpours — from the remnants of Hurricane Hilary and subsequent storms — revived annual wildflowers from seed over the last year. During the winter, extreme rainfall resurrected an ancient lake that is now disappearing once again.Together, these extremes have created bizarre juxtapositions in the famed desert.“I could take you to a field of dead creosote bushes with nice wildflowers springing up in between,” said Patrick Donnelly, a conservation biologist at the Center for Biological Diversity. “For a plant, it’s a post-apocalyptic wasteland — everything is dead — then spring comes and flowers are sprouting between the corpses.”Climate scientists have long predicted that global warming would both aggravate droughts in California’s inland deserts and also intensify bouts of rainfall. Death Valley locals say they’re watching that dynamic play out in real time. How desert plants, animals and local economies adapt to the changes in an environment that’s already one of the most extreme on Earth will determine the future of this symbol of resilience. “It’s interesting to have a front row seat,” Donnelly said. “This is the signature of climate chaos.” <h2>A 1-in-1,000-year storm — twice</h2>Susan Sorrells, who owns the ecotourism town of Shoshone, which is near Death Valley National Park, said the area’s weather is “always a roller coaster ride.” But that has been especially true over the last couple of years. In early 2022, Death Valley, like the rest of the American Southwest,  remained mired in the driest period since the year 800 . During the 22-year drought, soil moisture reached an all-time low. Plants were withering, including the creosote bush, which is known to live for thousands of years, thanks to deep roots that search for water and can survive on very little.Its dieback during drought, then, was evidence of the weather’s severity.“Desert shrubs are really tough and slow to die,” said Lynn Sweet, a research ecologist at the University of California Riverside. “But at some point, there is mortality.” Then, in August of that year, a deluge arrived. In several hours, Death Valley National Park received a record 1.7 inches of rain —  about three-quarters of its typical annual total . The 1-in-1,000 year storm, as weather forecasters would later call it, washed out park roads, moved boulders and trapped cars in debris. About a year later, remnants of Hurricane Hilary, a rare Pacific hurricane, dumped 2.2 inches of rain on the park —  exceeding its typical annual rainfall in one day  and setting a new 24-hour record.“To have the worst drought in recorded history and the most precipitation in history, it’s clearly climate whiplash,” Donnelly said. The rain closed the park, as well as Highway 127, which connects it to gateway communities but had become “a raging river,” Sorrells said.She operates an ecotourism business with a 20-bed inn, hiking trails, a trading post, an RV park and the Crowbar Cafe and Saloon. For Sorrells, the situation was dire, as the highway’s reconstruction was slated to last through the winter and into spring, making the area nearly impossible to access throughout its busy season.“We have a local joke: We make all our money from October through the end of April, and then we lose it from May through September,” she said. The community rallied together and pushed state leaders to speed up the project, Sorrells said. The park partially reopened in October, and the highway in January.Then things took a fascinating turn.Spring wildflowers, which germinated in the fall, survived a warm winter, when freezing temperatures would typically knock them back down, according to Donnelly. And in February, a multiday atmospheric river storm system brought another deluge. The wildflowers “lasted long enough for the atmospheric river to recharge them with all this rain,” Donnelly said. “Now, they’re growing in a very unusual way. They’re much taller than normal, much thicker-stemmed, very robust wildflowers.”There was also enough water to revive Lake Manly, an ancient lakebed usually filled with dust.For the first time, the National Park Service  announced in February that it would allow kayakers to paddle on the lake , which was as deep as 3 feet,  according to NASA . “People really came out for the sensational and fell in love with the beauty and charm and uniqueness of the desert,” Sorrells said. “We just started booming to the point we almost couldn’t keep up with the business.”<h2>Arid climate, flashy weather</h2>Most climate models expect California’s deserts to grow more arid over time, but also for infrequent storms to be more intense because a warmer atmosphere can hold more energy and water. “Flashier storms, longer droughts,” Sweet said. For some, the past few years have felt like a test drive of a new reality.Many desert species go dormant or hibernate during drought, which can make wet years look like a relative pageant of color and activity.The Mojave Desert tortoise, for example, weathers drought in underground burrows. Female tortoises can store sperm for years and save it for when the climate is just right to fertilize their eggs.Some hard-coated desert wildflower seeds can last for hundreds of years, until the right conditions emerge. “Death Valley is very extreme. You have to assume that plants and animals are adapted to the edges of what’s livable there. As it gets hotter, that gets to be more of a challenge,” Sweet said.Now, the rain is bringing renewal.  New shrubs are emerging, Sweet said, though they’ll need a “nice series of wet years” to survive. Wildflowers are feeding harvester ants, which feed lizards, which feed coyotes and other species. “We’re hoping the increase in resources makes its way up the food chain,” Sweet said. In a future that looks hotter and drier, she added, such respites will be essential: “Hopefully we’ll get these recovery periods of precipitation to refill the seed bank and energy reservoir of the whole ecosystem.” ",2024-04-20 14:00:00 PM EEST,NBC,"Tall flowers, dead shrubs, ephemeral lake: Death Valley has become a picture of climate whiplash",https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/death-valleys-wildflowers-lake-are-picture-climate-whiplash-rcna148241

"Kyle Stewart,Julie Tsirkin,Ali Vitali","WASHINGTON — A third House Republican has signed onto an effort to oust  Speaker Mike Johnson  from power, giving his opponents the votes they would need to remove the Republican leader unless Democrats step in to save him.Rep. Paul Gosar, of Arizona, signed onto the "" motion to vacate "" authored by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, of Georgia, both Republicans said Friday. If brought to the floor as a privileged resolution, it would force a vote within two legislative days on whether to oust Johnson as speaker. A simple majority vote would be needed to succeed.Rep. Thomas Massie, of Kentucky, joined the  motion to vacate earlier  this week but has said he doesn't want to force a vote on it, instead pushing for Johnson to resign. The three Republicans and other hard-right members of the conference are furious at the speaker for bringing up votes to provide aid for Ukraine, particularly without U.S. border security provisions attached. “We need a Speaker who puts America first rather than bending to the reckless demands of the warmongers, neo-cons and the military industrial complex making billions from a costly and endless war half a world away,” Gosar said in a statement Friday.If brought to the floor, those three Republican votes would be enough to remove Johnson as speaker if all Democrats vote against him. Some Democrats have indicated they would  step in to save Johnson , but Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Friday that ""the pre-requisite to the conversation"" about saving Johnson is that the foreign aid bills pass ""in totality.""The addition of a third Republican on the motion to vacate is a huge blow to Johnson, raising the likelihood that he is either ousted from power or that he's saved by Democrats, which could further undermine him within the conference. “Johnson is done,"" said one Republican who supports the speaker. ""It’s sad.”Greene ""has the votes,"" said another Republican. The member said they believe Democrats will vote to save Johnson — especially after the way the aid packages were structured, which drew the ire of some conservatives.Massie said the intention isn't to force a vote to oust Johnson but instead to show their numbers and get the speaker to resign on his own. That would avoid weeks of chaos on the floor, where the House must hold consecutive votes to install a speaker, and instead allow Republicans to meet behind closed doors and choose a new leader before Johnson voluntarily vacates the chair, Massie told reporters.“The strategy all along has been to ask the speaker to resign in a fashion like John Boehner resigned, where John Boehner cleaned the barn and said, 'I’m leaving and you’ve got plenty of time to replace me,'"" Massie said. ""So, in that circumstance, we didn’t end up with the speaker-less House. ... Just like when you leave a job, you give two weeks' notice, we’re looking for Mike’s notice.”Massie suggested that a vote to oust Johnson could result in Republicans ending up in the minority; the balance of power is so close in the House that it wouldn't take much movement to elect Jeffries as speaker. Voting to remove Johnson would lead the House to hold vote after vote ""sometimes two times, three times a day,"" Massie noted. Thus voting for Jeffries just to end the chaos might start to look appealing to a handful of Republicans.“If Johnson would do it in the manner that John Boehner did it, there’s no chance to go into the minority because it’s not fought out on the floor. ...  Jeffries is not on the ballot when we do this in conference,"" Massie stressed. ""And so that’s the goal.”He added that he had 12 people in mind who could do a better job than Johnson.Greene has not indicated if or when she’ll try to force a vote on the motion to vacate.Gosar announced that he had joined the effort to oust Johnson just after the House voted to advance the package of four foreign aid bills — one for Ukraine, one for Israel, another for Taiwan and a fourth that attempts to counter China by providing a  pathway to ban TikTok in the U.S.  as well as other national security priorities.Johnson called the House package of foreign aid bills “the best possible product that we can get under these circumstances,” noting that Democrats control the Senate and the White House.He said that a discharge petition from Democrats to force the House to take up a Senate-passed foreign aid package would have “happened imminently” if the House had not acted.“The reality here is that if the House did not do this ... we would have had to eat the Senate supplemental bill,” he told reporters.",2024-04-19 19:51:00 PM EEST,NBC,"Another Republican joins effort to oust Johnson, putting the speaker in real peril",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/third-republican-oust-mike-johnson-vote-democrats-rcna148582
Matt Dixon,"Donald Trump  emerged from a Manhattan courtroom Monday ready for a fight.After day one of a trial that has Trump  facing 34 counts  of falsifying business records related to hush money payments to a porn star, the former president stood in front of reporters ready to unleash a grievance-laced tirade that, at times, did not totally reflect reality but guaranteed he would continue to dominate the headlines even from court.His immediate focus was Judge Juan Merchan’s decision to not yet rule on whether Trump can attend his son Barron’s May 17 high school graduation. Merchan did not say Trump could not go, but rather he was not yet ready to rule on the matter. Specifics aside, however, it gave Trump just enough to paint the picture for his supporters of a biased judge blocking a loving father from seeing his son’s graduation.“My son is graduating high school, and it looks like the judge will not let me go to the graduation,” Trump told the assembled group of reporters.It’s emblematic of how Trump has tried to control the narrative — an instinct that has defined his political career — even while stuck in a camera-less Manhattan courtroom. The judge has ordered Trump to attend court hearings in person, so it’s a predicament he will find himself in at least four days a week for the foreseeable future as President Joe Biden continues to run a more traditional presidential campaign. The false claim a judge was not allowing him to attend his son’s graduation spread like wildfire in the conservative ecosystem, a conflagration helped by some of his top supporters with huge followings. Kari Lake called Merchan “ heartless & cruel. ” Piers Morgan used a  New York Post column  to call the-decision-that-was-not “disgusting.” Donald Trump Jr. called it “ pure evil .” For millions of Trump supporters, the half-truth became the truth and a cause celebre for those eagerly looking to maintain the belief that the entire legal fight is an attempt by Democrats to get Trump locked up.Those sorts of distortions and fights about nearly every aspect of the trial dominated the first week, which focused on jury selection. It was often reality versus Trump’s version of it.There were reports Trump may have  fall en  asleep  in court, where cameras are not allowed in these types of cases. He responded forcefully on Truth Social that “I was PRAYING not sleeping!!!”Trump had a misunderstanding about the jury selection process. It led him to post on Truth Social that the process is another example of “ ELECTION INTERFERENCE! ” And Trump has broadly used a torrent of Truth Social posts and media interviews to paint a picture of both Merchan and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg as biased and out to get him, a sentiment that has been taken as gospel and amplified by conservative media.In fundraising text messages, Trump has also told supporters that he left the courtroom, which at no point during the week happened except during scheduled court recesses or when court was over for the day.“I JUST STORMED OUT OF COURT!” read a fundraising text message from Trump’s campaign. “They think I’m finished, but I’LL NEVER SURRENDER!”Trump also tried to raise political cash off the claim that he has been blocked from attending Barron’s graduation.“THEY ARE FORCING ME TO SKIP MY SON’S GRADUATION,” Trump’s campaign texted. “I’LL BE IN COURT.”“Heartless thugs,” it continued.The trial-focused fundraising efforts have been breaking through the noise. On the first day of trial, Trump's campaign raised $1.6 million in small-dollar donations, a campaign official told NBC News. Trump raised that much online on only three days in the first three months of 2024, according to a recent campaign finance filing from WinRed, the Trump campaign's online donation platform. Each of those three days came toward the end of March.""Crooked Joe Biden and the Democrat's entire strategy to defeat President Trump is to confine him to a courtroom and unconstitutionally silence him throughout this sham Biden trial,"" said Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt. ""Polling shows the American people see right through the Stalinist tactics employed by Crooked Joe and his allies.""""President Trump and his team will continue fighting for truth in the courtroom, while working to earn votes on the campaign trail,"" she added.Much of the nation’s attention is focused on the historic nature of an ex-president on trial, a saturation that has helped Trump continue his unmatched ability to get and retain attention regardless of the specific situation — which, in this case, is being stuck in court facing unflattering revelations about his personal life and accusations about trying to hide the information to get elected. “I don’t think any of it matters. He totally rewrote the rules,” said a longtime Republican operative granted anonymity to speak freely about Trump’s week-one performance. “There are between 75-80 million people who will vote for him because he is a scrappy fighter. Working class folks see him as a billionaire bubba.”The entire episode sets up a split screen of a former president mired in legal fights and stuck in court and an incumbent president checking all the boxes of what would be considered a traditional presidential campaign. Biden has a significant fundraising advantage and continues to hold in person campaign rallies, most recently a swing through Pennsylvania, including events in  his hometown  of Scranton, where he attacked Trump on a range of issues — but noticeably did not mention his legal woes. Biden's campaign  has previously said  it would avoid directly taking shots at Trump's legal problems to try and avoid the perception of a weaponized Justice Department. Beyond fundraising text messages, Trump’s political operation has continued to work in the background. On Wednesday — the trial’s off day — Trump had dinner with Polish President Andrzej Duda at Trump Tower in New York, and on Saturday, he is set to hold a rally in North Carolina, a  key swing state.Trump has also  installed top allies  to lead the Republican National Committee, which has generally been focused on the more basic types of political blocking-and-tackling as the presidential nominee is likely to be stuck in courtrooms for most of the 2024 election cycle. Including the current trial, Trump faces four separate criminal indictments and a handful of civil lawsuits, some of which will  continue to play out through November. ""We are getting a lot of data being shared with us to help us register and engage voters,"" an RNC member said. Trump has also used post-trial campaign stops to attract attention, including a Tuesday visit to a New York bodega. Trump at times tried to use the stop to focus on the rising cost of consumer goods and crime, which have been two policy themes of his presidential campaign, but the focus inevitably turned to his trial.Trump was asked what he thought about the seven jurors who had been selected as of Wednesday —  the full 12-member jury  was chosen Thursday — and he was blunt that the outcome would drive his assessment. “I’ll let you know in about two months,” Trump said of the trial’s likely timeline.",2024-04-19 12:00:00 PM EEST,NBC,Twisted truths and a fundraising boost: How Trump tried to control his first week in court,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/twisted-truths-fundraising-boost-trump-control-first-week-court-rcna148054

Ryan J. Reilly,"WASHINGTON — Three California men who were associated with the ""Three Percenter"" militia group and convicted in connection with the Jan. 6 Capitol attack were taken into custody Friday after a judge ordered them to serve sentences ranging from 21 to 33 months in federal prison, far below what the government had requested.Erik Scott Warner, Felipe Antonio Martinez, Derek Kinnison and Ronald Mele were all  found guilty  of felony obstruction of an official proceeding and other charges after a trial last year. One of their co-defendants, former California police chief Alan Hostetter, was  sentenced to more than 11 years in federal prison  in December. The trials featured testimony from co-defendant  Russell Taylor , who pleaded guilty as part of a plea deal with the government.The felony charge they were convicted of — obstruction of an official proceeding —  is currently before the Supreme Court , where some of the justices seemed skeptical of the way the government had used the charge. A decision in that case is expected in the coming months. If the Supreme Court guts the charge, two of the defendants could end up only serving 12 months in prison on their misdemeanor convictions.The men communicated over a ""The California Patriots — DC Brigade"" Telegram chat and brought weapons on their trip to Washington to participate in Jan. 6, according to evidence shown at trial. They kept a shotgun in their car, and Kinnison and Mele claimed they stored five handguns in their hotel room ""despite understanding that it was illegal,"" the government said. “We’re packing light just a scatter gun and a pistol a piece,"" Martinez joked, according to prosecutors.Prosecutors had sought lengthy sentences for the foursome between 6.5 and eight years in federal prison, but Judge  Royce Lamberth  landed on much lower sentences within the guidelines range.Warner received 27 months after telling Lamberth that he ""got caught up"" in the mob and was sorry for his conduct. ""I shouldn't have been there,"" he said, apologizing to his family for putting them ""through hell.""Martinez received 21 months in prison after he said he was ""very sorry"" and apologized for his conduct, telling Lamberth that he would ""never see me back here.""Kinnison was sentenced to 33 months in prison. He spoke about his love of God, family and country and said he admired the ""Judeo-Christian principles that the country was founded upon."" He said that he did repent for his sins and ask forgiveness for his sins and that he was praying for Lamberth and the prosecutors on the case. Mele was also sentenced to 33 months. Prosecutors said he ""awarded"" his co-conspirators a ""Capitol Action Badge"" a few weeks after Jan. 6, which prosecutors described as a ""crudely modified version of a real military reward."" He said Jan. 6 ""gave this country a black eye"" that was still tender. Mele said he had pulled himself away from politics and that the experience of going through trial and seeing videos of some of the horrific violence at the Capitol had ""opened my eyes."" He said that he didn't condone what happened, calling it ""asinine.""The government had sought eight years in prison for all the defendants except for Martinez, who they said should serve six and a half years.The stakes, Assistant U.S. Attorney Anthony Mariano argued, could not be much higher, and the defendants here were in a “rare class” of Jan. 6 defendants who “worked together and had a plan” and were convicted in a criminal conspiracy. They came to Washington with “everything a soldier going into battle needs,” he noted.""We are 262 days away from Jan. 6, 2025,"" Mariano said Friday, arguing that the sentence imposed ""needs to consider January 6, 2025, 2029, 2033, and so on.""More than 1,387 people have been charged in connection with the Capitol attack, with more than 984 defendants having been convicted. Of the more than 859 defendants who have been sentenced, more than 520 have been sentenced to periods of incarceration of a few days behind bars to  22 years in federal prison .The overwhelming majority of Jan. 6 defendants in custody either admitted to their criminal conduct or were found guilty at trial; only about  15 defendants in pretrial custody .",2024-04-20 00:35:00 AM EEST,NBC,Judge locks up 'Three Percenter' militia members in Jan. 6 obstruction case,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/judge-locks-three-percenter-militia-members-jan-6-obstruction-case-rcna148456
The Associated Press,"The Sheetz convenience store chain has been hit with a lawsuit by federal officials who allege the company discriminated against minority job applicants.Sheetz Inc., which operates more than 700 stores in six states, discriminated against Black, Native American and multiracial job seekers by automatically weeding out applicants whom the company deemed to have failed a criminal background check, according to U.S. officials.President Joe Biden stopped by a Sheetz for snacks this week while campaigning in Pennsylvania.The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed suit in Baltimore against Altoona, Pennsylvania-based Sheetz and two subsidary companies, alleging the chain’s longstanding hiring practices have a disproportionate impact on minority applicants and thus run afoul of federal civil rights law.Sheetz said Thursday that it “does not tolerate discrimination of any kind.”“Diversity and inclusion are essential parts of who we are. We take these allegations seriously. We have attempted to work with the EEOC for nearly eight years to find common ground and resolve this dispute,” company spokesperson Nick Ruffner said in a statement.The privately held, family-run company has more than 23,000 employees and operates convenience stores and gas stations in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, Ohio and North Carolina.The lawsuit was filed in federal court on Wednesday, the day Biden stopped at a Sheetz market on  a western Pennsylvania campaign swing , buying snacks, posing for photos and chatting up patrons and employees.Federal officials said they do not allege Sheetz was motivated by racial animus, but take issue with the way the chain uses criminal background checks to screen job seekers. The company was sued under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits workplace discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion and national origin.“Federal law mandates that employment practices causing a disparate impact because of race or other protected classifications must be shown by the employer to be necessary to ensure the safe and efficient performance of the particular jobs at issue,” EEOC attorney Debra M. Lawrence said in a statement.“Even when such necessity is proven, the practice remains unlawful if there is an alternative practice available that is comparably effective in achieving the employer’s goals but causes less discriminatory effect,” Lawrence said.It wasn’t immediately clear how many job applicants have been affected, but the agency said Sheetz’s unlawful hiring practices date to at least 2015.The EEOC, an independent agency that enforces federal laws against workplace discrimination, is seeking to force Sheetz to offer jobs to applicants who were unlawfully denied employment and to provide back pay, retroactive seniority and other benefits.The EEOC began its probe of the convenience store chain after two job applicants filed complaints alleging employment discrimination.The agency found that Black job applicants were deemed to have failed the company’s criminal history screening and were denied employment at a rate of 14.5%, while multiracial job seekers were turned away 13.5% of the time and Native Americans were denied at a rate of 13%.By contrast, fewer than 8% of white applicants were refused employment because of a failed criminal background check, the EEOC’s lawsuit said.The EEOC notified Sheetz in 2022 that it was likely violating civil rights law, but the agency said its efforts to mediate a settlement failed, prompting this week’s lawsuit.For more from NBC BLK,  sign up for our weekly newsletter .",2024-04-19 19:59:00 PM EEST,NBC,Convenience store chain with hundreds of outlets in 6 states hit with discrimination lawsuit,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/sheetz-convenience-store-chain-discrimination-lawsuit-eeoc-rcna148567
The Politics Desk,"Welcome to the online version of  From the Politics Desk , an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the campaign trail, the White House and Capitol Hill.In today’s edition, senior legal correspondent Laura Jarrett explains how Donald Trump has already hobbled his legal team one week into his criminal trial. Plus, ""Meet the Press"" moderator Kristen Welker breaks down how foreign affairs has defined Joe Biden's presidency.Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.<h2>How Trump has hobbled his legal team before the first witness is even called at his historic trial</h2>For the better part of the last year, former President Donald Trump has sought to turn what would ordinarily amount to significant legal trouble into a political asset. Four indictments and one mugshot later, he’s successfully managed to dodge any dip among his supporters. Yet now that he stepped into a no-frills Manhattan courtroom this week for the start of his first criminal trial, the legal downside of his political strategy has come into sharp view.Do you have a news tip?  Let us know The rules of criminal procedure don’t change, no matter the defendant, even for a former president. And the courtesies and customs recognized between seasoned prosecutors and defense lawyers begin to break down, if not completely collapse. In a telling moment near the end of a long day in court Thursday, Trump’s lead attorney, Todd Blanche, asked if he could get the names of the first three witnesses the prosecution intends to call. That’s a routine and reasonable request. But the prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, rebuffed him. Why? Because “Mr. Trump has been tweeting about the witnesses,” Steinglass said. “We’re not telling them who the witnesses are. I’m sorry.” Judge Juan Merchan, who has been the subject of his own wave of attacks from the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, then said: “I can’t fault the People for that.” The issue came up again late Friday afternoon, and the prosecution agreed to turn over the name of the first witness to the defense on Sunday. But the implication remains: Trump’s legal team is facing a distinct strategic disadvantage with less time to plan cross-examinations of the state’s witnesses. In other words, instead of being able to focus all weekend on prioritizing the expected testimony of just a few witnesses, all are up for grabs. And it’s all because Trump has been railing against multiple witnesses online, and has only ramped up his vitriol in recent days, notwithstanding a court order directing him not to do so.This is the year the legal and political lives of Trump have been on a collision course. The only difference is, now the side that’s feeling the burn is his own team.<h2>Trump trial latest: Jury selection completed during a tense day inside and outside the courtroom</h2>Opening statements are set to begin next week in  Trump’s criminal trial  after the final members of the jury were seated Friday, following a dramatic day in which two prospective jurors broke down in tears, an appeals court judge rejected the former president’s request for a stay, and a man  set himself on fire  in front of the New York City courthouse.“We’re going to have opening statements on Monday morning. This trial is starting,” Merchan said towards the end of the day, after successfully seating the remaining five alternate jurors that were needed.The case — the first-ever criminal trial of a former president — will be heard by a panel of 12 jurors and a total of six alternates. It’s expected to last roughly six weeks.The five alternates ultimately selected Friday include an unemployed married woman who’s into art and described herself as not political, an audio professional, a contract specialist, a clothing company executive and a construction company project manager. It took four days of jury selection to find the 18 jurors.Around the same time the judge declared “we have our full panel” inside the courtroom in the early afternoon, a man set himself on fire outside the courthouse. A spokesperson for the NYPD said the man was in critical condition. He appears to have had pamphlets describing a conspiracy involving cryptocurrency that he threw around before setting himself ablaze, police said.Read more from the fourth day of the Trump trial here →<h2>A pivotal moment for Biden, Ukraine and Congress</h2>A pivotal moment has arrived for President Joe Biden, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and House Speaker Mike Johnson. Can the GOP-led House pass the aid Ukraine says it needs in its two-year-old war against Russia? If it does, is it already too late to help? How much longer does Ukraine need assistance? And how much is riding on the outcome of the 2024 election, given Trump’s past opposition to this aid?  These are among the questions that I plan to ask Zelenskyy on Sunday when I interview him on “Meet the Press.”The congressional fight for Ukraine aid has also underscored an important point about the Biden presidency: It’s been largely defined — and unsettled — by events overseas. It began with the botched  and deadly  U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021.Then there was Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.And then came the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack in Israel, which has led to a six-month war. Just in the past week, we saw Iran  launch  missile strikes and drones at Israel, while Israel  responded  Thursday night by carrying out what appears to be a limited response inside Iran.“We don’t want to see this escalate. ... We’re not looking for a wider war with Iran. ... I think, you know, the coming hours and days will tell us a lot,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby  told me last Sunday . How foreign affairs has defined Biden’s presidency has carried over with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — and with the current congressional drama over whether the U.S. will continue to provide Ukraine with the funding it needs.All of it creates a fraught backdrop as the 2024 race heats up.That’s all from The Politics Desk for now.

"Adam Reiss,Megan Lebowitz","New York Attorney General Letitia James on Friday asked that a judge void former President  Donald Trump's  bond in his civil fraud case, questioning whether the company that  issued  it has the funds to back it up.In a 26-page filing ahead of a pre-scheduled hearing on Monday, James expressed concern about whether Knight Specialty Insurance Company could secure the $175 million bond. She also argued that the collateral put up by the former president should be under the full control of the company. One of James' concerns about KSIC is that the insurer ""is not authorized to write business in New York and thus not regulated by the state’s insurance department."" She added that the company ""had never before written a surety bond in New York or in the prior two years in any other jurisdiction, and has a total policyholder surplus of just $138 million."" James also criticized Trump's team's apparent hold on the collateral put up to back the bond.""KSIC does not now have an exclusive right to control the account and will not obtain such control unless and until it exercises a right to do so  on two days’ notice ,"" she wrote.Neither Trump's lawyers nor KSIC immediately responded to a request for comment. Trump attorney Alina Habba previously said when the former president's bond was posted that he ""looks forward to vindicating his rights on appeal and overturning this unjust verdict.""The new filing comes after James filed a notice  earlier this month  seeking more information about the former president's bond. In that filing, she asked that Trump's lawyers or the insurance company ""file a motion to justify the surety bond"" or provide additional information about the collateral put up by Trump within 10 days. The bond for Trump and his co-defendants was  reduced  by a state appeals court to $175 million in March, down from $464 million. Trump had been  liable  for $454 million, the vast majority of the original sum. The former president has repeatedly slammed the case against him and denied any wrongdoing.James’ filing comes as Trump was in the courtroom for his New York criminal hush money case where he faces  34 counts  of falsifying business records and as a state appeals court judge rejected Trump’s request for a emergency stay of the trial. A jury has been seated in that case and arguments are set to begin on Monday.

Sahil Kapur,"WASHINGTON — The House is poised to vote Saturday on a quartet of bills that would authorize new U.S. aid to  Israel  and  Ukraine , alongside security assistance for the Indo-Pacific and a bill that would force  TikTok’s parent company to sell it or be banned  in the U.S.The chamber is scheduled to vote in the afternoon on the four bills in succession, one day after a rare and extraordinary bipartisan coalition  teed up the votes , with more Democrats (165) than Republicans (151) voting for the “rule” to proceed to the measures.The bills are expected to pass and then go to the Senate for approval as soon as in the next few days. Taken together, they include the $95 billion aid package championed by President Joe Biden, with some changes from the version  passed by the Senate  two months ago.Holding the vote represents an act of defiance by Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., against an outspoken faction of conservative rebels who oppose Ukraine funding and pushed him not to bring it to a vote. Three of them — Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz. — have  threatened  to oust him as speaker. The passage of the bill may bring Greene one step closer to forcing a vote to remove him.After months of wavering, Johnson sided with Biden, Democrats and the Republicans who believe that helping Ukraine fend off Russian aggression is essential to U.S. national security interests, citing briefings he has received and warning: “Vladimir Putin would continue to march through Europe if he were allowed.”“I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys,” Johnson told reporters, noting that his son will enter the Naval Academy this year. “This is a live-fire exercise for me as it is so many American families. This is not a game, this is not a joke.”Ahead of the vote, former President Donald Trump issued a confusing statement that sympathized with both the pro- and anti-Ukraine aid factions of the GOP without taking a clear position.Apart from the three aid bills, the fourth measure includes a policy to force the China-based ByteDance to sell TikTok within nine months — which the president could extend to a year — or face a nationwide ban. The policy, which lengthens the time frame for a sale from an earlier House bill, has Senate buy-in along with Biden’s support, putting TikTok closer than ever to a ban in the U.S.If they pass, the bills are expected to be packaged together and sent to the Senate, which will have to vote on the whole legislation to send it to Biden's desk to sign into law. It’s unclear when that will happen, but Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., are outspoken proponents of the foreign aid provisions in the package.“I hope that President Biden will soon have on his desk long-awaited funding to support our friends in Ukraine and Israel and the Indo-Pacific, and aid for innocent civilians in need of humanitarian aid in Gaza and around the world,” Schumer said before the House vote, cautioning that Ukraine's hopes against Russia would diminish without additional U.S. weapons to defend themselves. Late Friday, Schumer said the Senate was working to get unanimous agreement to move quickly to vote on the foreign aid legislation. “We are working on an agreement for consideration of the supplemental,” he said on the Senate floor. McConnell said earlier this week: “Here’s the political reality: If you think the fall of Afghanistan was bad, the fall of a European capital like Kyiv to Russian troops will be unimaginably worse, and if stalled American assistance makes that outcome possible, there’s no question when the blame will land, on us.”",2024-04-20 14:00:00 PM EEST,NBC,House to vote on critical aid for Ukraine and Israel and a potential TikTok ban,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-vote-critical-aid-ukraine-israel-potential-tiktok-ban-rcna148395
"Zoë Richards,Ryan J. Reilly","A former Marine who  carried a tiki torch  ahead of a 2017  white nationalist rally  in Charlottesville, Va., pleaded guilty Friday in connection with the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.Tyler Bradley Dykes, of Bluffton, S.C.,  pleaded guilty  to two felony counts of assaulting, resisting or impeding officers who were protecting the Capitol. The crime carries a maximum penalty of eight years in prison, a $250,000 fine and up to three years supervised release, according to the plea agreement.Attorneys for Dykes did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday evening.Dykes, 26, was arrested in July, on a  series of federal charges , including misdemeanors. Prosecutors agreed to request the dismissal of the other counts in the indictment during sentencing as part of his plea agreement, according to court documents.His sentencing is scheduled for July 19.According to  court documents , Dykes subscribed to a series of public Telegram groups tied to the 2020 presidential election, allegations of voter fraud and events related to the certification of President Joe Biden’s victory ahead of the Jan. 6 riot. One group that he subscribed to, which called for violence and overthrowing the government by force, included a message that referred to a quote attributed to Adolf Hitler, prosecutors said.Dykes — who previously served a prison sentence following a felony conviction tied to the 2017 torch-lit march in Charlottesville a night before the ""United the Right"" rally — wore a gray puffer jacket and neck gaiter over his face during the Capitol riot, according to court documents.Prosecutors said Dykes was among a group of rioters who sought to push their way into the Capitol through the East Rotunda doors. Dykes was also accused of forcibly stealing a U.S. Capitol Police officer’s riot shield and using it to push his way into the Capitol and to impede the police line defending the Capitol once inside.Among the more than 859 defendants who have been sentenced since the 2021 riot, more than 520  have been sentenced  to periods of incarceration ranging from a few days to  22 years in federal prison .",2024-04-20 04:13:00 AM EEST,NBC,Charlottesville tiki torch carrier pleads guilty in Jan. 6 riot case,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/charlottesville-tiki-torch-carrier-pleads-guilty-jan-6-riot-case-rcna148644
"Peter Nicholas,Natasha Korecki","REHOBOTH BEACH, Del. — Standing outside Joe Biden’s church in this seaside town, the Rev. William Cocco mulls a question the president has grappled with over his long political career: How does a practicing Catholic defy church teaching and come out in favor of abortion rights, as Biden has done?“I think it’s very difficult to reconcile that,” Cocco said in an interview this month after he presided over a service at St. Edmond Roman Catholic Church. “Life is a gift from God.”Biden would have been at Mass that day, lining up for communion with the other parishioners, but he hurried back from his vacation home for meetings about Iranian plans to attack Israel.An irony of Biden’s final campaign is that one of the most vexing issues he has ever confronted personally — abortion — is now central to his political survival. Biden’s campaign and his entire party have made abortion a defining issue in his re-election bid, hoping to rally female voters alarmed by Republican efforts to roll back reproductive freedoms.The young Catholic politician who once said the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade ruling that safeguarded abortion rights “ went too far ” — and who to this day remains  uneasy with the procedure  — is casting himself as the only thing standing between women and strict national abortion bans.He vows to  chisel Roe’s protections into law  if he’s re-elected and secures friendly majorities in Congress, quashing a GOP-led push to forbid most abortion procedures. On Tuesday, Biden is scheduled to  give  a speech in Tampa, Florida  condemning the state's new six-week abortion ban.Jennifer Klein, director of the White House’s Gender Policy Council, recalls Biden’s reaction upon hearing that the Supreme Court had overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Thinking through the decision in the Oval Office, “he was angry,” Klein said in an interview. “He went quickly to the fact that this had never been done before and the Supreme Court had never overturned a fundamental freedom. He also went immediately to what might come next: If they take away this right, what other rights would be under attack?”Biden may have little choice but to put abortion rights front and center. He is running about even with Donald Trump in the polls, despite Trump’s myriad legal troubles. Voters largely don’t know about Biden’s legislative victories, nor do they credit him with strong economic growth, opinion surveys show.Biden needs something to jolt the electorate and galvanize voters who may feel his candidacy is uninspiring. Many allies see abortion as the answer. Polls suggest that voters already trust him on the issue. Asked which of the two candidates is closer to their views on abortion and same-sex marriage, 48% of registered voters in Pennsylvania — a key swing state — chose Biden, compared with only 35% who picked Trump, a  Franklin & Marshall College  poll this month found. Hoping to ensure women retain access to abortion and, as a bonus, juice voter turnout in November, Democrats have been filing  ballot measures  that would enshrine abortion rights in Arizona and other battleground states. And Biden’s campaign has gone all in,  churning out ads , news releases and social media posts casting him as a stalwart defender of the abortion-rights movement. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat who has pushed reproductive rights as a top issue in his state and founded a nonprofit group that is supporting abortion referendum efforts in multiple states, predicted abortion could “absolutely” decide November’s election.“There’s a strong portion of the Biden coalition that is motivated on the issue and a strong group of people who might otherwise have stayed home but for the fact that the Dobbs decision [overturning Roe] came down and now this is a major threat to people all over the country,” Pritzker said in an interview.  Biden’s 50-year evolution from Roe skeptic to Roe adherent mirrors that of many Americans and the Democratic Party itself. The party’s presidential platform in 1972 — the year Biden was first elected to the Senate — carried not a single mention of abortion. By 2016, the year Hillary Clinton was the party’s nominee, the platform was chockablock with vows to defend abortion rights to the hilt.The issue has been particularly fraught for Biden, an 81-year-old steeped in Catholic teachings and reliant on religious faith to cope with unthinkable tragedy: the deaths of two children and his first wife, Neilia.“One of the things that carried him through his numerous difficulties is his Catholic approach of giving yourself to the Lord,” said Ted Kaufman, a longtime Biden confidant and his former Senate chief of staff.On a human level, Biden has never fully overcome his misgivings about abortion. That’s evident even in the language he occasionally uses. Two years ago, talking to reporters before he boarded Air Force One, Biden referred to the procedure as aborting “ a child ” rather than a fetus, a clue about the point at which he believed life began.Still, his stance is that he won’t impose his personal views on Americans who believe differently. In 1974, the year he said in an interview that Roe. v. Wade went “too far,” he also voiced opposition to a constitutional amendment to ban abortion, albeit with some ambivalence, a hometown  news report at the time  shows. A column in the Morning News of Wilmington in January 1974 said Biden told a group of anti-abortion activists: ""I am not sure my stand against such a constitutional amendment is right, nor am I sure the anti-abortionist stand is right, but right now I think I am more right than you are.""Lauren Hitt, a campaign spokesperson, said in a prepared statement: “Joe Biden has opposed abortion bans since the 1970s. As a senator, he voted repeatedly to protect Roe, and as President, he has used his full executive authority to fight back on extreme MAGA attacks on reproductive freedom.”Biden described the tensions between faith and policy last year at a  Maryland fundraising event .“I happen to be a practicing Catholic,” he said. “I’m not big on abortion. But guess what? Roe v. Wade got it right.” A look at his record shows that his path has had its share of starts and stops. As a senator in 1982, he voted in a committee meeting in favor of a constitutional amendment that would have given states the power to restrict abortion if they chose, effectively overturning Roe v. Wade.At the time, Biden said his aim was to push the vote to the Senate floor, where it would finally be resolved. The measure never got that far, and when it came up again the next year, he voted against it.In 2019, as the Democratic front-runner for the presidential nomination, he  reversed his long-held position  in favor of the so-called Hyde Amendment banning federal funding for abortions.That about-face came at head-spinning speed. One day, his campaign said he supported the Hyde Amendment; the next day, amid blowback from fellow Democrats, he dropped that position. He justified the switch by saying he could no longer support the policy because Republicans were  restricting access to abortion  in poor neighborhoods.“Joe Biden is an Irish Catholic kid from Scranton,” said John Carr, founder of the Initiative on Catholic Life and Social Thought at Georgetown University. “He seems to stay with Catholic orthodoxy until he thinks the political or other costs are too high.”Biden recognized early on that his nuanced position — wary of abortion at his core, accepting of abortion rights in the public square — was bound to cause him grief. He told fellow Sen. Abe Ribicoff of Connecticut in 1973 that his stance would most likely please no one, according to his 2007 memoir, “Promises to Keep.” That proved prescient.In Biden’s first year as president, conservative Catholic bishops argued that he shouldn’t receive communion given his backing of abortion rights. He met privately with Pope Francis at the Vatican in October of that year, and afterward he said the pope had assured him that communion shouldn’t be withheld.Kathleen Sebelius, who was health and human services secretary in President Barack Obama’s administration, said in an interview that she sympathized with Biden’s predicament.“I’m born and raised Catholic and went to Catholic schools for 17 years of my life,” said Sebelius, a former governor of Kansas. “I understand this issue. I’ve been called out by the archbishop. I was  ordered not to take communion .“I’ve been on the personal side of this and the political side of this, and I understand the struggle that those of us who are raised in a faith community and then live in a political world deal with,” she added. “It’s not easy. I think Nancy Pelosi [the former House speaker, who is also Catholic] understands that. I think Joe Biden understands it. It’s not a simple choice.”Whatever Biden’s journey, most advocates say they now have full confidence that he is a reliable champion of abortion rights. When Biden left the Senate in 2009, he had a 100% rating from what was then called NARAL Pro-Choice America, a group promoting abortion access.“Biden is not the same man as he used to be when it comes to abortion rights,” said Ilyse Hogue, former president of the organization. “I don’t think he’s been hiding his agenda just to win a second term and then secretly plans to turn around and become this anti-choice guy. I’m not worried about it at all.” Some still don’t believe Biden goes far enough to promote reproductive rights.Renee Bracey Sherman, founder and a co-executive director of We Testify, an abortion rights advocacy group, said Biden should use his megaphone to remove the stigma tied to abortion instead of airing his personal doubts. She  pointed to recent surveys  indicating that 6 in 10 Catholics support abortion rights. “He’s the president of the United States; he’s not the pope of the United States,” Bracey Sherman said. “I’m sorry, he’s allowed to have his personal feelings. But at the end of the day, he is the president, and he is supposed to defend the Constitution and people in this country who need abortions.”Bracey Sherman said her organization reached out to the Biden administration multiple times offering to bring Catholics who have had abortions into the White House to share their stories — but has yet to hear back.“He makes it seem as though he’s the one who’s following the Catholic teachings,” she said. “But what about the rest of the Catholics in America who do support access to abortion and have abortions?” Elections are a choice. Even Biden detractors say they’re fully aware that the only realistic alternative at this point is Trump, whom they view as an extremist on the issue. Abortion looks to be one of Trump’s glaring vulnerabilities. He has boasted about his role in overturning Roe v. Wade through his appointment of three conservative Supreme Court justices during his single term. “There is a fundamental question and a fundamental difference between the president and Donald Trump and their belief on whether the Constitution affords women a right to choose. Donald Trump does not; Joe Biden does,” said Kate Berner, a former Biden White House official. Trump recently said abortion decisions should be left to the states after he was criticized that he has been murky about what he believes. Even so, he sought to  dissociate himself  from a recent state court ruling in Arizona upholding a 19th century law imposing a near-total abortion ban. Disavowing Arizona’s strict anti-abortion measure isn’t so easy for Trump. The reason it can take effect springs directly from the votes of conservative Supreme Court justices whom Trump worked to install.“The fact is that he announced he was going to stack the court with justices who could be counted on to overrule Roe v. Wade,” said Laurence Tribe, a Harvard Law School professor emeritus. “He succeeded in that. They did it. That led to the revival of laws like Arizona’s, even if Trump says: ‘Oops, I’m sorry that’s the consequence. It doesn’t make me look good politically.’”Biden was at the White House last Sunday, dealing with the fallout from Iran’s attack on Israel. When he’s in Washington on the weekends, he’ll often attend services at Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Georgetown, the church frequented by the nation’s first Catholic president, John F. Kennedy. A Black Lives Matter banner hangs from a fence outside. Biden wasn’t in the pews that day; he was attending a virtual meeting with U.S. allies about the Iranian attack.The Rev. Patrick Earl led the Mass and greeted congregants at the doorway afterward. He said in an interview that Biden is a “good presence” during services, recalling how he once left his seat to congratulate a boy’s family celebrating his First Communion. Earl said he understood Biden’s position, even if it conflicts with church teaching. “As the political leader of a very varied country, you can’t just say, ‘You’ve got to believe as I believe,'"" he said. ""You just can’t."" ",2024-04-20 12:00:00 PM EEST,NBC,Biden's 50-year journey as a skeptic of Roe v.

Katherine Doyle,"Four days into  the first criminal trial  of a president,  Donald Trump  was showing signs of frustrations.He had listened to scores of New Yorkers express less-than-favorable opinions about him, was restricted in what he could say in court and had even been told to sit down by the judge.“Sir, can you please have a seat,” said Juan Merchan, the soft-spoken judge who is presiding over Trump’s hush money trial, when the former president thought Friday's proceedings were over and got up to leave.As Trump returned to the defense table, Merchan thanked him.Trump exited the room minutes later looking weary and promising to testify at the trial, which he slammed as a “witch hunt.”His comments capped a week that was filled with power reversals and accusations turned upside down.Trump, who prosecutors say used hush money payments to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, is attempting to make a parallel case in the court of public opinion.Speaking to reporters on Friday, the presumptive Republican nominee for president groused that “instead of being in Pennsylvania or Georgia, or North Carolina or lots of other places today, I’m sitting in a courthouse all day long,” adding that process “will go on for another four or five weeks.”The trial is expected to last as many as six weeks.Trump, who is required to be in court for the duration of the trial, also accused the district attorney’s office of waging interference in the 2024 presidential election on behalf of President Joe Biden by “keeping me off the campaign trail.”He went on to argue that he was “not allowed to speak” after the judge said he must curtail his social media attacks against potential witnesses in the case, and later told supporters in a fundraising email that he was “FULLY GAGGED.”Much of Friday's drama unfolded outside the courthouse, where a man  set himself on fire  in a park facing the court. Police extinguished the flames and he was taken to a hospital where he later died.In the courtroom, Trump sat at the defense table as prospective jurors were asked questions aimed at sussing out their ability to be impartial.One alternate juror was excused for anxiety, which she believed would hamper her ability “to be completely fair.” Another was questioned about a social media post referencing the former president, saying, “I do believe he’s the devil.”“I don’t recall posting that,” the man said, before being dismissed.Trump had taken a particular interest in the man, who had volunteered for the campaign of his 2016 Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.Social media posts made the case for dismissing several other potential jurors, even after they said they could judge Trump fairly.A retired New York high school teacher said he could “absolutely” be fair and impartial, but was compelled to answer questions about excavated social media posts that revealed in 2017 he had attended “a massive anti-trump rally,” according to the caption of a picture in which he had tagged himself online.He was excused.By Friday afternoon, Merchan had seated a full 12-person jury and assigned six alternates. All 18 will meet for the first time on Monday morning, when opening statements are set to get underway.Trump’s defense team looked noticeably downcast during the afternoon’s proceedings, with attorney Susan Necheles slumped back into her seat, arms crossed until addressing the judge late in the day. Lead attorney Todd Blanche was seated next to Trump, and the two sat watching and occasionally whispering to one another.After Merchan said he would not consider a motion on presidential immunity and other motions, Blanche insisted there was still more to discuss.“This sounds suspiciously like the 10 minutes we spent arguing this on Monday … with no new facts, no new application of the law,” Merchan responded.“There’s nothing else to re-argue,” he added as the first week of the trial came to a close. “We’re going to have opening statements Monday morning. This trial is starting.”",2024-04-20 05:38:00 AM EEST,NBC,Trump vows to make his voice heard in court as first week of trial draws to a close.

"Lisa Rubin,Megan Lebowitz,Corky Siemaszko","The New Yorkers who could decide  Donald Trump’s fate  were vetted in real time on Friday by the former president’s defense team.As the potential alternate jurors were being questioned by prosecutors seeking to convict Trump of  illegally paying hush money to a porn star , and by defense attorneys trying to keep him out of jail, a jury consultant hired by Trump's legal team was watching the candidates closely for telltale signs of possible bias while simultaneously feeding the defense attorneys her impressions.Follow along for live updatesMeanwhile, other jury consultants say, it is likely that a team of researchers working with the jury consultant were doing social media and other online searches to fill out the picture of every potential juror and sending that information to Trump’s lawyers in the courtroom. “All this has to happen relatively quickly,” said veteran jury consultant Jo-Ellan Dimitrius of Dimitrius & Associates, who has been following the case and identified the firm working for Trump as Magna Legal Services.The Philadelphia-based firm did not respond to a call from NBC News but court records show that Magna served as Trump’s jury consultant when was ordered to pay $83.3 million in damages to writer  E. Jean Carroll  for defaming her in 2019.It was not immediately clear if the Manhattan District Attorney’s office used its own jury consultant to vet jurors and a spokesperson for the agency did not return numerous phone calls from NBC News. By midday, jury selection had been completed and Trump's first trial was heading for opening arguments.Using jury consultants for vetting has become a fairly common practice.“In my experience, there’s usually a consultant sitting behind the lawyers with a laptop who is feeding information to the lawyer doing the questioning of jurors,” Dimitrius said. “They usually have the home office doing the social media checks and other searches because the primary role of the consultant in the courtroom is to listen and watch the jurors and give feedback to the lawyers.”Sometimes the background checks of potential jurors are being done even before the questioning begins, Dimitrius said.“Generally on the morning of jury selection you get a list of potential jurors,” she said. “So we will take an iPhone photo of the list and send it back to the office where they’ll start their searches.”Tampa-based jury consultant Michael Boucher of TCS, who has worked on a number of high-profile cases in New York City, like former Alaska Gov.  Sarah Palin’s failed libel case  versus the New York Times, echoed Dimitrius.“In a case like this, we would set up a laptop on the podium and use a messaging app to stay in contact with the lawyers questioning the jurors,” Boucher said. “Not only are you feeding the lawyer information, you are finding on the jurors online, you’re trying to help guide the lawyer asking the questions. Lawyers, at times, sometimes get too far into the weeds and they need assistance so they can come up with follow-up questions.”At the same time, Boucher said, “We’re watching the reactions of the other jurors waiting to be questioned and feeding that information to our legal team. That way, when the next potential juror steps up we already have a sense of where they stand.”Boucher said in his experience Manhattan jury pools tend to be sophisticated, well-educated and thoughtful. But cases involving polarizing figures like Trump or Palin “sometime attract what we call 'motivated jurors,' with strong feelings either for or against"" them.“It’s very hard to find anybody who doesn’t have an opinion about Trump,” he said.NBC News Legal Analyst Danny Cevallos, an attorney who practices in New York and elsewhere, agreed.“In virtually every other case in the world, there’s not a strong chance that the jurors have tweeted about the defendant or posted on social media,"" Cevallos said. ""This is the rare one-in-a-million case where there’s a good chance all of us have retweeted or tweeted something about Donald Trump.""Renato Stabile, managing director at Dubin Research & Consulting in New York City, said the ability to track social media has revolutionized the way juries get picked — and how jury consultants do their jobs.“Before you just had to rely on what jurors said in court, and I think lawyers depended a lot more on their experience and gut, and maybe unfortunately, stereotypes that were either correct or incorrect and their past experience,"" Stabile said. ""Now you just get such a better sense of what jurors are really all about based on the articles they’re liking, what they’re reposting.""Examining social media is ""probably the most important part of jury selection,” said David Oscar Markus, a criminal defense attorney who, among others, successfully defended former Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum  against charges of lying to the FBI .“Lots of folks will come into court and say, ‘Yes, of course, I can be fair,’ or, ‘I have feelings about this one way or the other, but I can put all those aside and give the prosecution and defense a fair shake',"" Markus said. ""But then, once you see posts, even if they’re old posts, they reveal sort of the jurors’ true feelings.”Lisa Rubin and Corky Siemaszko reported from New York City, Megan Lebowitz reported from Washington, D.C.",2024-04-19 23:40:00 PM EEST,NBC,Trump's defense used a jury consultant to research and help them select jurors,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trumps-defense-used-jury-consultant-research-help-select-jurors-rcna148605
"Frank Thorp V,Sahil Kapur,Ryan Nobles","WASHINGTON — The Senate voted   to reauthorize a powerful surveillance tool the U.S. government describes as critical to combating terrorism, after defeating efforts by civil liberties advocates on the left and right to rein it in.The vote of 60-34 sends the bill to President Joe Biden, who has championed it. The legislation extends  Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , or FISA, for two more years.The final vote came after the Senate defeated six amendments from progressive and conservative senators who said the spying powers are too broad and demanded protections for Americans’ civil liberties and privacy. The Biden administration and FISA supporters had warned that even a brief lapse could have a detrimental impact on the intelligence-gathering process. Senators just missed the midnight deadline to reauthorize the FISA Section 702 statute but voted to reauthorize it minutes later. Had any amendments been adopted, the bill would have been sent back to the House, potentially forcing a lengthy lapse of the law.“In the nick of time, bipartisanship has prevailed here in the Senate,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said.“It wasn’t easy, people had many different views, but we all know one thing: letting FISA expire would have been dangerous. It’s an important part of our national security to stop acts of terror, drug trafficking, and violent extremism,” Schumer said on the Senate floor. “Thank you to all my Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their good work in getting this done.”The House  passed a two-year FISA renewal  last week after defeating, by the slimmest of margins, an amendment to require a warrant to search through the communications of Americans as part of data collected while surveilling foreigners. Senators delayed a vote for days by pushing for amendments to make changes to the bill.The bill’s passage came on the heels of a pitched battle between the U.S. intelligence community and an unusual coalition of progressive and conservative civil liberties advocates, who argued that the powers are too expansive and impinge on the privacy of Americans.“It’s important that people understand how sweeping this bill is,” said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the Intelligence Committee and outspoken proponent of privacy protections. “Something was inserted at the last minute, which would basically compel somebody like a cable guy to spy for the government. They would force the person to do it and there would be no appeal.”In a rare break with Schumer and Biden, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the president pro tempore, opposed the bill, saying: “I have strong concerns that this expansion of FISA Section 702 authorities would allow for increased abuse and misuse of the law — infringing on the rights of Americans here at home.”Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Mark Warner, D-Va., pushed back on that and other criticisms of a House amendment added to the FISA reauthorization bill, arguing that it “is narrowly focused on a significant intelligence gap,” but some members like Wyden worry it could be abused.“Contrary to what some have been saying, it expressly excludes coffee shops, bars, restaurants, residences, hotels, libraries, recreational facilities and a whole litany of similar establishments,” Warner said on the Senate floor Wednesday. “It also absolutely would not, as some critics have maintained, allow the U.S. government to compel, for example, a janitor working in an office building in Northern Virginia to spy for the intelligence community.”Warner said that allowing FISA to expire would have put the U.S. in “uncharted territory” as companies who work with the government to provide intelligence might have stopped doing so without a reauthorization.Sen.

The Associated Press,"The rights of LGBTQ students will be protected by federal law and victims of campus sexual assault will gain new safeguards under rules finalized Friday by the Biden administration.The new provisions are part of a revised Title IX regulation issued by the Education Department, fulfilling a campaign pledge by President Joe Biden. He had promised to dismantle rules  created by former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos , who added new protections for students accused of sexual misconduct.Notably absent from Biden’s policy, however, is any mention of transgender athletes.The administration originally planned to include a new policy  forbidding schools  from enacting outright bans on transgender athletes, but that provision was put on hold. The delay is widely seen as a political maneuver during an election year in which Republicans have  rallied  around  bans on transgender athletes  in girls’ sports.Instead, Biden is officially undoing sexual assault rules put in place by his predecessor and current election-year opponent, former President Donald Trump. The final policy drew praise from victims’ advocates, while Republicans said it erodes the rights of accused students.The new rule makes “crystal clear that everyone can access schools that are safe, welcoming and that respect their rights,” Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said.“No one should face bullying or discrimination just because of who they are, who they love,” Cardona told reporters. “Sadly, this happens all too often.”Biden’s regulation is meant to clarify schools’ obligations under  Title IX , the 1972 women’s rights law that outlaws discrimination based on sex in education. It applies to colleges and elementary and high schools that receive federal money. The update is to take effect in August.Among the biggest changes is new recognition that Title IX  protects LGBTQ students  — a source of deep conflict with Republicans.The 1972 law doesn’t directly address the issue, but the new rules clarify that Title IX also forbids discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. LGBTQ students who face discrimination will be entitled to a response from their school under Title IX, and those failed by their schools can seek recourse from the federal government.Many Republicans say Congress never intended such protections under Title IX. A federal judge previously blocked Biden administration guidance to the same effect after 20 Republican-led states  challenged the policy .Rep. Virginia Foxx, a Republican from North Carolina and chair of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, said the new regulation threatens decades of advancement for women and girls.“This final rule dumps kerosene on the already raging fire that is Democrats’ contemptuous culture war that aims to radically redefine sex and gender,” Foxx said in a statement.The revision was  proposed nearly two years ago  but has been slowed by a comment period that drew 240,000 responses, a record for the Education Department.Many of the changes are meant to ensure that schools and colleges respond to complaints of sexual misconduct. In general, the rules widen the type of misconduct that institutions are required to address, and it grants more protections to students who bring accusations.Chief among the changes is a wider definition of sexual harassment. Schools now must address any unwelcome sex-based conduct that is so “severe or pervasive” that it limits a student’s equal access to an education.Under the DeVos rules, conduct had to be “severe, pervasive and objectively offensive,” a higher bar that pushed some types of misconduct outside the purview of Title IX.Colleges will no longer be required to hold live hearings to allow students to cross-examine one another through representatives — a signature provision from the DeVos rules.Live hearings are allowed under the Biden rules, but they’re optional and carry new limits. Students must be able to participate from hearings remotely, for example, and schools must bar questions that are “unclear or harassing.”As an alternative to live hearings, college officials can interview students separately, allowing each student to suggest questions and get a recording of the responses.Those hearings were a major point of contention with victims’ advocates, who said it forced sexual assault survivors to face their attackers and discouraged people from reporting assaults. Supporters said it gave accused students a fair process to question their accusers, arguing that universities had become too quick to rule against accused students.Victims’ advocates applauded the changes and urged colleges to implement them quickly.“After years of pressure from students and survivors of sexual violence, the Biden Administration’s Title IX update will make schools safer and more accessible for young people, many of whom experienced irreparable harm while they fought for protection and support,” said Emma Grasso Levine, a senior manager at the group Know Your IX.Despite the focus on safeguards for victims, the new rules preserve certain protections for accused students.All students must have equal access to present evidence and witnesses under the new policy, and all students must have equal access to evidence. All students will be allowed to bring an advisor to campus hearings, and colleges must have an appeals process.In general, accused students won’t be able to be disciplined until after they’re found responsible for misconduct, although the regulation allows for “emergency” removals if it’s deemed a matter of campus safety.The latest overhaul continues a back-and-forth political battle as presidential administrations repeatedly rewrite the rules around campus sexual misconduct.The DeVos rules were themselves an overhaul of an Obama-era policy that was intended to force colleges to take accusations of campus sexual assault more seriously. Now, after years of nearly constant changes, some colleges have been pushing for a political middle ground to end the whiplash.",2024-04-19 16:14:00 PM EEST,NBC,"Biden's new Title IX rules protect LGBTQ students, but trans sports rule still on hold",https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/bidens-new-title-ix-rules-protect-lgbtq-students-trans-sports-rule-sti-rcna148537
"Erika Edwards,Marina Kopf","Alarm bells ring in Matt Murray’s head when a prescription for misoprostol comes through his independent pharmacy in Boise, Idaho.“Are there directions on the prescription that show what it’s being used for?” said Murray, a pharmacist and director of operations for Customedica Pharmacy. “If not, then we would probably need to call the [doctor’s] office and confirm why it’s being prescribed.”The medication is legal — approved by the Food and Drug Administration to prevent stomach ulcers — but it can also be used for abortions, which became illegal in Idaho with few exceptions when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.When that happened, misoprostol went from “something that wasn’t on the radar but now sends up an alert in the pharmacy,” Murray said.Misoprostol, which works by contracting the uterus, is also commonly used ahead of gynecologic procedures, such as the insertion of intrauterine devices for birth control, or after miscarriages, when pregnancies end on their own. The drug helps speed up the time it takes for a woman's body to expel the failed pregnancy.Murray’s hesitation in dispensing misoprostol isn’t based on personal feelings about abortion. It’s the fear of legal action or jail time.Idaho’s “ Defense of Life Act ” says any person who performs or assists in an abortion could face felony criminal charges and up to five years in prison. Exceptions include to save the life of the woman and in cases of rape or incest. Does that mean pharmacists could be liable for dispensing a drug that could be used in an abortion — even if it’s not?Pharmacists like Murray in Idaho aren’t sure.“The law isn’t clear whether a pharmacist is committing a felony for dispensing the medication,” he said. “What level of due diligence are we expected to perform?”Alison Tanner, senior legal counsel at the National Women’s Law Center, said, “Pharmacists are understandably scared by these incredibly strict abortion laws that have been enacted, and they are afraid that they might be charged with a felony simply for doing their job.”In some cases, pharmacists have refused to prescribe misoprostol, no matter its purpose.The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services told NBC News it isn’t able to confirm the number of complaints it has received from women who have been denied prescribed medications.In a  public statement last year , Melanie Fontes Rainer, director of HHS’ Office for Civil Rights, acknowledged that women across the country have faced delays in getting medication even when they weren't seeking abortions.“The overturning of Roe v. Wade is causing chaos in our healthcare system, including in our pharmacies, where healthcare providers are suddenly being asked to not only provide healthcare, but also become legal experts in navigating the patchwork of abortion bans,” Rainier wrote in a statement.The Idaho Board of Pharmacy said that because of the “uniqueness of every situation,” it isn’t providing guidance for its pharmacists who dispense medications that could be used to terminate a pregnancy.“Pharmacists licensed in Idaho are expected to comply with the law. Idaho law, in most circumstances, prohibits abortion,” a board representative wrote in an email, adding that “abortion does not mean the removal of a dead unborn child or the treatment of a woman who is no longer pregnant.”Kristin Colson, 36, of Boise, experienced her own distressing delay.When she and her husband, Loren, realized she was having a miscarriage in January, her doctor prescribed misoprostol. The natural process of a miscarriage can be unpredictable, and it can take months, but misoprostol helps speed it.It was the couple’s fifth pregnancy loss. Kristin had used the drug successfully in the past.“Everybody processes grief differently. But for me, I like to have a plan,” Colson said. “Choosing to use the medication, I can time when this happens.” She waited more than a day to hear back from her local Walgreens, she said. When she called to ask about the status of her order, the pharmacist, Colson said, told her that he “didn’t feel comfortable filling the misoprostol prescription at that dosage, given the Idaho laws.”The response was a shock, she said.“It’s a tough time. You’re trying to process your loss. And I was frustrated, confused,” Colson said. “You just want to move on.”Loren Colson, also 36, said: “We’re trying to start a family. We’re not old, but we’re not young, either. We are on a little bit of a timeline if we want to start our family. It really impacts us, any delay in that process.”In a statement, Walgreens said that while it doesn’t require “pharmacists with moral objections to dispense reproductive medications,” it actively works to make sure other pharmacists are available to fill prescriptions.Another Walgreens ultimately filled Kristin Colson’s misoprostol prescription.But the concern among pharmacists remains.“Ultimately, the fear is that people aren’t getting the medical care that they’re needing,” Murray said.",2024-04-19 01:24:00 AM EEST,NBC,Some pharmacists fear jail time over murky abortion laws,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/abortion-ban-pill-misoprostol-rules-pharmacists-rcna148359
Jane C. Timm,"Donald Trump's presidential campaign and the Republican National Committee announced a massive “election integrity” operation on Friday, promising to deploy 100,000 volunteers and attorneys to battleground states to “protect the vote and ensure a big win” in November.In a press release, officials said they wanted the volunteers and lawyers to monitor logic and accuracy testing, early voting, ballot tabulation, mail ballot processing and Election Day voting, as well as post-election canvasses, audits, and recounts. The release suggests they may intend to recruit poll workers, too.“Having the right people to count the ballots is just as important as turning out voters on Election Day,” Trump said in the release..""The RNC is hiring hundreds of election integrity staff across the map — more than ever before because our Party will be recruiting thousands of more observers to protect the vote in 2024. These campaign officials in states are tasked with recruiting, training, and when possible, shifting poll watchers and poll workers day in and day out,"" added RNC co-chair Lara Trump.Poll watching is a normal part of elections — both parties do it — but experts warn that unruly operations can be a problem. And as Trump and his allies continue to make false claims about the 2020 election, some experts worry that empowering these sort of observers at polling sites could hamper normal election operations or intimidate voters. The GOP release notes they plan to work with ""passionate grassroots coalitions who are deeply invested in fighting voter fraud.""The planned operation would double the RNC’s promised  50,000-person operation  from 2020, though some experts said both numbers figures were aspirational and unrealistic. The RNC did not respond to a request for data on how many people had volunteered or been staffed in recent elections.“I’ve actually run a program like this with real people,” said Justin Levitt, a former advisor in the Biden White House on democracy issues who has previously worked in the Department of Justice on voting issues. “We did really well and got multiple tens of thousands.”Recruiting individuals in particular to monitor for voter fraud, he said, is even harder than staffing poll workers.“They’re recruiting people to stand there and watch for something that’s not going to happen. Can you please show up and watch, wait for the UFO for 15 hours?” he said. Marc Elias, a leading Democratic election lawyer, agreed the 100,000 number was unrealistic, but said he was still concerned about the plans.""I think they are going to have a massive voter suppression operation and it is going to involve very, very large numbers of people and very, very large numbers of lawyers,"" he said. ""I think we need to take the RNC literally and seriously — except on their numbers.""Lauren Groh-Wargo, executive director of Fair Fight PAC, the political advocacy arm of the Georgia voting rights group of the same name, said the effort would harm election administration.“The Republican National Committee’s new voter suppression unit is just the latest version of their cynical playbook to divide and intimidate voters and steal American’s voices by building an operation based on the lie of voter fraud,” she said in a statement. Until 2018, the RNC’s poll watching plans were limited by a consent decree, which required it seek court approval to prove that any poll watching work wasn’t discriminatory. That decree was put into place after Democrats sued and accused the RNC of sending armed, off-duty police officers to patrol the polls in minority neighborhoods in 1981. The decree required them to seek prior court approval for poll watching operations, but expired at the end of 2017 after 35 years.Poll observers are a normal and beneficial part of the election process when they are well trained and do not interfere with administrators work, said David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation and Research, a group that helps support election officials. An army of 100,000 would present a different dynamic, he said, but noted that election workers are prepared to handle unruly observers if they appear.""They will protect the right of their voters to vote free of intimidation. If observers are acting any way contrary to voters interests or interfering with poll workers, they will be dealt with under the laws of the state,"" he said.",2024-04-19 22:27:00 PM EEST,NBC,"Trump campaign, RNC pledge to deploy 100,000 attorneys and volunteers to monitor the vote",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-rnc-vote-monitor-election-integrity-rcna148557
Elizabeth Chuck,"Trader Joe’s has recalled packaged herbs linked to a multistate salmonella outbreak, the grocery chain announced this week.The product, Infinite Herbs organic basil, was sold in 2.5-ounce clamshell containers from Feb. 1 to April 6  in 29 states, as well as in Washington, D.C.,  Trader Joe’s said Wednesday. There have been 12 reports in seven states of people being infected with salmonella, an organism that can cause serious or fatal illness,  according to federal officials . One person was hospitalized.“Seven of eight cases with information available reported exposure to fresh organic basil purchased from Trader Joe’s before becoming ill,” the Food and Drug Administration said on its website, adding that “traceback data” it had collected determined that Florida-based Infinite Herbs had supplied the basil to Trader Joe’s.Grego Berliavsky, the head of Infinite Herbs, said Wednesday that the company had voluntarily recalled the product. “I am heartbroken at the thought that any item we sold may have caused illness or discomfort,” he said in a  statement . “We simply will not rest until we can once again be confident in the safety of this product.”Berliavsky added that customers should check their freezers for the basil.“Fresh basil naturally wilts and expires after five to seven days, so we are confident that the recalled basil is no longer available for sale,” he wrote. “However, if you have food in your freezer that includes Infinite Herbs organic basil purchased between February 1 and April 6, do not consume it.”The basil had been sourced from a single farm, which is no longer in production, Berliavsky said.“We are working with the farmer to conduct an internal investigation of the food safety practices. Through this investigation, our goal is to determine the cause of this recall and apply measures to prevent it from happening again,” he wrote.Symptoms  of salmonella include diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The symptoms usually start six hours to six days after infection, and while most people recover within a week without antibiotics, some may need medical treatment. The CDC says that children younger than 5, adults 65 and older and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to get serious salmonella infections but that anyone who has severe diarrhea, bloody stools, a fever higher than 102 degrees or prolonged vomiting may need antibiotics or to be hospitalized.Salmonella causes about 1.35 million infections, 26,500 hospitalizations and 420 deaths in the U.S. every year,  according to the CDC . But official counts are likely to be an underestimate because most people recover without seeking medical help or without confirmed diagnoses, said Barbara Kowalcyk, an associate professor of exercise and nutrition sciences at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. Infections come from a variety of sources, including consuming contaminated food and water or touching infected animals and their environments.In rare cases, salmonella or its toxins can enter the bloodstream, causing serious illnesses, death or long-term conditions like arthritis, Kowalcyk said.""One of the things in food safety that we try to do is make people aware that it's not just this bad tummy ache,"" she said. ""There are other health implications.""Salmonella is not visible, and it cannot be smelled or tasted, Kowalcyk said. Trader Joe’s instructed customers to discard the packaged basil or to return it for a full refund. The FDA said infections have been reported in Florida, Georgia, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Wisconsin; the product was also distributed in Alabama, Connecticut, Washington, D.C., Delaware, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, North Carolina, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and Vermont.The news comes a month after another large Trader Joe’s recall involving potential salmonella contamination. In March, the grocer  recalled cashews sold in 16 states . No illnesses were reported in that instance. Earlier in March, Trader Joe’s recalled  steamed chicken soup dumplings  that federal officials said could be contaminated with “hard plastic from a permanent marker pen.”",2024-04-18 19:17:00 PM EEST,NBC,Salmonella outbreak prompts Trader Joe's to recall herbs sold in 29 states,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/salmonella-outbreak-prompts-trader-joes-recall-herbs-sold-29-states-rcna148356
Matt Lavietes,"Scotland’s sole clinic for treating transgender youths announced Thursday that it is pausing new prescriptions of puberty blockers for minors.Sandyford, a health clinic in Glasgow operated by Scotland’s National Health Service,  said in a statement  that it is indefinitely pausing new prescriptions of the medication for people under 18 who are experiencing “gender incongruence.” Patients who are already undergoing treatment will not be affected. “We are committed to providing the best possible clinical care for young people accessing and understand the distress that gender incongruence can cause,” the clinic said. “While this pause is in place, we will continue to give anyone who is referred into the Young People Gender Service the psychological support that they require while we review the pathways in line with the findings.”The announcement comes less than two weeks after a report commissioned by England’s National Health Service concluded that the medical evidence around transition-related care for minors is “remarkably weak” and that more research is needed. The report, known as the  Cass Review , was funded by the NHS and independently led by prominent British pediatrician Dr. Hilary Cass.In March, prior to the release of the full report, England’s NHS said it would stop new prescriptions of puberty blockers. Public health officials in Scotland cited the Cass Review for their reasoning, saying it would be working with England’s NHS to “generate evidence of safety and long-term impact for therapies.”“The Cass Review is a significant piece of work into how the NHS can better support children and young people who present with gender dysphoria,” Tracey Gillies, executive medical director at NHS Lothian, one of the 14 regional divisions of NHS Scotland, said in a statement. “Patient safety must always be our priority and it is right that we pause this treatment to allow more research to be carried out.”Scottish Trans, a division of Scotland’s Equality Network that focuses on trans rights, said that Scottish health officials were making the “wrong decision, and that it will harm trans children and young people.”“This decision has been taken within the context where the reality of trans people’s experiences and lives is questioned almost daily in some of the media and some political circles,” the group said in a statement. “This makes us worry that the decision has been influenced by that context rather than solely through consideration of the best interests of trans children and young people.”Puberty blockers — which have been used for decades to delay puberty in children who were developing too quickly — are now typically prescribed to prevent the onset of puberty for youths questioning their gender identities. The drugs also give youths greater time to decide whether to pursue more permanent treatments like hormone replacement therapy and transition-related surgeries.Nearly all of the  major medical associations  in the United States have come out in favor of transition-related care, including puberty blockers, for the physical and mental well-being of transgender minors. Twenty-three U.S. states have enacted bans on gender-affirming care, including the prescription of puberty blockers, according to the  Movement Advancement Project , a think tank that tracks policies affecting LGBTQ Americans. Health care providers in five states — Florida, Alabama, Oklahoma, North Dakota and Idaho — could be charged with a felony for providing gender-affirming care to trans minors, according to MAP.",2024-04-18 19:14:00 PM EEST,NBC,Scotland pauses prescriptions of puberty blockers for transgender minors,https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-health-and-wellness/scotland-pauses-prescriptions-puberty-blockers-transgender-minors-rcna148366
Aria Bendix,"A  number  of  studies  have  suggested  that eating only during a limited window of time can help some people lose weight. But it's unclear why: Does the strategy just help people eat less, or is there something beneficial about keeping meals within a shorter time frame? New research falls in the former camp, suggesting that the amount of calories people consume matters more than the timing. A small, randomized trial at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine — the results of which were published Friday in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine — found that when researchers controlled the number of calories people consumed, both time-restricted and regular eating schedules resulted in similar degrees of weight loss. “It makes us think that people who benefit from time-restricted eating — meaning they lose weight — it’s probably from them eating fewer calories because their time window’s shorter and not something else,” said the study’s lead author, Dr. Nisa Maruthur, an associate professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University.Time-restricted eating regimens vary, and some are similar to intermittent fasting, a type of diet that involves alternating between periods of fasting and eating. The new trial looked at a 10-hour eating window, which is longer than what would typically qualify as intermittent fasting. The researchers supplied 41 people with prepared meals for 12 weeks. The participants, most of them Black women, had obesity and were either prediabetic or diabetic. Their meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner and a snack) were designed to contain the same number of calories they ate in their daily lives, based on their age, sex, weight, height and level of physical activity. The food had a healthy balance of fat, carbohydrates and protein. On a given day, participants might have cereal and a fruit cup for breakfast, a kale salad with white beans and lentils for lunch, peanuts or mandarin oranges for a snack and a beef stew for dinner.Half the group ate meals over a 10-hour window, from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Around 80% of their calories were consumed at breakfast and lunch, because some research has suggested that eating most of your calories early in the day could be  beneficial for weight loss . The other half ate from 8 a.m. to midnight and consumed half of their daily calories at dinner — a schedule meant to mimic many people’s eating patterns outside a research setting. During the eating windows, the trial didn’t limit beverages if they were calorie- and caffeine-free. Participants were also each allowed one cup of coffee, diet soda and alcoholic beverage per day. Outside the designated time periods, only water was allowed.At the end of the study, participants lost roughly the same amount of weight regardless of which regimen they followed. The average in the time-restricted eating group was around 5.1 pounds lost, compared to 5.7 pounds for the other group. There were no significant differences in blood sugar, blood pressure, waist circumference or lipid levels. The results were similar to the findings of a  randomized trial last year , which found that intermittent fasting was  similar to calorie counting  as a weight loss strategy. However, research overall on time-restricted eating is mixed: A  six-year study  didn’t find a link between weight change and  limiting food intake  to a specific time window.The new trial was distinctive in that the researchers controlled what all participants ate — a rarer and more complex experiment design.But its results come with a few caveats, said Dr. Lisa Chow, a professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota who wasn’t involved in the study.The trial may not have captured the long-term benefits of time-restricted eating, she said.  One of her own studies , published last year, found that six months of time-restricted eating — from noon to 8 p.m. daily — was more effective for weight loss than calorie restriction in people with Type 2 diabetes.What's more, Chow added, the trial didn’t reflect what time-restricted eating looks like in real life, because it controlled people’s calories and meals.  “When you’re talking about the doctor talking to a patient about weight loss, it’s not the same thing, because the doctor isn’t going to provide all the food,” she said.Other researchers also think meal timing matters for weight loss.According to Satchin Panda, a professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, the ideal time-restricted eating schedule involves waiting an hour or two after you wake up to have your first meal, then consuming your last meal three hours before bedtime.“It doesn’t depend on the world clock — it depends on your internal clock,” Panda said. “A person who wakes up at 6 a.m., it may be OK for them to start at 8 a.m. But the person who wakes up at 8 a.m. may start eating at 9 or 10 a.m.”That’s because the stress hormone cortisol is high after you wake up, and melatonin — a hormone that regulates sleep — is still declining at that time. So it may be more difficult for people to properly digest soon after they arise, Panda said. Eating close to bedtime, meanwhile, can disturb sleep, and insufficient sleep may increase cravings, Panda added. Some  research  also suggests that late-night eating could cause people to store more energy as fat.Time-restricted eating may offer benefits other than weight loss, as well.Panda’s research  has found that the approach may reduce so-called “bad cholesterol” and improve blood pressure and blood sugar in people with certain chronic health conditions.On the other hand, a study published last month found that restricting food consumption to less than eight hours per day  may increase the risk of cardiovascular death  long-term.At the very least, Panda said, time-restricted eating may offer a simpler alternative to calorie counting.“It’s easier to count time than count calories,” he said. “I’d guess that most people cannot remember how many calories they’ve consumed, but timing is easy to remember.”",2024-04-19 16:00:00 PM EEST,NBC,Eating within limited hours can help with weight loss — but that may be because it simply cuts calories,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/why-eating-time-restricted-helps-weight-loss-rcna148041
NBC News,"<h2>How Trump tried to control his first week in court</h2>Trump emerged from a Manhattan courtroom Monday ready for a fight.After day one of a trial that has him  facing 34 counts  of falsifying business records related to hush money payments to a porn star, the former president stood in front of reporters ready to unleash a grievance-laced tirade that, at times, did not totally reflect reality but guaranteed he would continue to dominate the headlines even from court.His immediate focus was Judge Juan Merchan’s decision to not yet rule on whether Trump can attend his son Barron’s May 17 high school graduation. Merchan did not say Trump could not go, but rather he was not yet ready to rule on the matter. Specifics aside, however, it gave Trump just enough to paint the picture for his supporters of a biased judge blocking a loving father from seeing his son’s graduation.Read the full story here .<h2>Trump’s lawyers used jury consultant to research and help select jurors</h2>The New Yorkers who could decide Trump's fate were vetted in real time today by the former president’s defense team.As the potential alternate jurors were being questioned by prosecutors seeking to convict Trump of illegally paying hush money to a porn star, and by defense attorneys trying to keep him out of jail, a jury consultant hired by Trump’s legal team was watching the candidates closely for telltale signs of possible bias while simultaneously feeding the defense attorneys her impressions.Meanwhile, a team of researchers working with the jury consultant were doing social media and other online searches to fill out the picture of every potential juror and sending that information to Trump’s lawyers in the courtroom.Read the full story here.<h2>Police 'emptied' fire extinguisher on man who set himself on fire, witness says</h2>An eyewitness said he saw police empty a fire extinguisher on the  man who set himself on fire  outside of the courthouse this afternoon.""He was alive and moving when they put him on the ambulance, and they got him out of here pretty quickly,"" freelance photojournalist Ed Quinn told NBC News in an interview.Quinn said he was standing alongside the fence at Collect Pond Park near the courthouse when the park filled with smoke, ""and then the smoke from the fire extinguisher was billowing around. People were horrified.""<h2>New York AG asks judge to void Trump’s bond in his civil fraud verdict</h2>In a separate case, New York Attorney General Letitia James today asked that a judge void Trump's bond in his civil fraud case, questioning whether the company that issued it has the funds to back it up.In a 26-page filing ahead of a scheduled hearing on Monday, James expressed concern about whether Knight Specialty Insurance Company could secure the $175 million bond. She also argued that the collateral put up by the former president should be under the full control of the company.One of James’ concerns about KSIC is that the insurer “is not authorized to write business in New York and thus not regulated by the state’s insurance department.” She added that the company “had never before written a surety bond in New York or in the prior two years in any other jurisdiction, and has a total policyholder surplus of just $138 million.”Read the full story here.<h2>Trump arrives back at Trump Tower</h2>The former president's motorcade returned to Trump Tower, where he waved to the crowd, shortly after 5 p.m.<h2>Trump says he will testify in hush money trial</h2>On his way out of the courtroom today, Trump was asked whether he will testify in this case.He answered simply, ""Yes.""Trump  previously indicated  he would take the stand.<h2>State appeals court denies Trump's request to delay trial</h2>Another appeals court has denied Trump's request to delay the hush money trial.Trump's lawyers filed another appeal of the decision to not move the trial out of Manhattan.<h2>Trump speaks to reporters, reiterates unfounded claims</h2>Trump spoke with reporters after the court was adjourned, reiterating accusations that the trial is a ""concerted witch hunt"" and repeating unfounded claims that he was being targeted to hurt his campaign. After this morning complaining to reporters that the case was keeping him stuck in court for weeks, this afternoon Trump complained that the judge was moving too quickly. Trump also railed against the civil fraud case, also in New York, criticizing New York Attorney General Letitia James and Judge Arthur Engoron.The former president did not answer shouted questions from reporters. <h2>Court adjourns for the weekend</h2>The court adjourned for the day.Trial proceedings will resume on Monday at 9:30 a.m. ET.<h2>Opening statements will take place on Monday, judge says</h2>Judge Merchan said this afternoon that the trial will move to opening statements on Monday, a timeline he said he was aiming for earlier this week.“We’re going to have opening statements on Monday morning. This trial is starting,"" Merchan said.<h2>Judge says he won't consider Trump's immunity motion</h2>Judge Merchan said that he would not consider Trump's immunity motion that was filed just before the hush money trial began.“That matter is decided and will not be addressed any further,"" Merchan said.<h2>Merchan to decide Sandoval hearing questions on Monday</h2>Judge Merchan told attorneys that he'll have an answer on the Sandoval hearing questions on ""Monday morning.""He added that he'll also need time that day ""for a few matters I want to take up including pre-motion letters that have been filed.""His remarks came after the court heard arguments over what prosecutors plan to ask defendants on cross-examination in order to help them decide whether to take the stand in their own defense.<h2>Prosecution points out that Merchan presided over a Trump case being debated as relevant</h2>In the Sandoval hearing, lawyers for both sides have ticked through the cases that prosecutors want to be able to ask Trump about if he testifies. Included in them is a case that Merchan himself presided over.""As your honor knows as you presided over the trial, my colleagues argued extensively Mr. Trump knew about the scheme to defraud and conspiracy and falsifying business records,"" said prosecutor Matthew Colangelo.""The owners of the corporation knew it and the owner was Mr Trump. The evidence at that trial showed the defendant knew and the court of appeals says the defendant can be questioned, and we don’t see any issue with the witness advocate where the attorney would be a fact witness,"" he added. ""We only want to question the defendant about the fact and there is no plausible problem there.”<h2>Judge lashes out at Trump attorney over redactions: 'Have a seat'</h2>In a tense exchange over redacting certain documents, Bove told Merchan that prosecutors ""have been invested in this case since 2018, and to say this is too much work is outrageous,” referring to Trump's attorneys' claim that it would be too much work to redact certain documents.""I am not going to ask people to do that. It is absurd,” the judge told Trump's lawyer, adding, ""Have a seat, I am signing the order.""<h2>Police say man who set himself on fire threw 'conspiracy theory' pamphlets</h2>Maxwell Azzarello, the man identified by police as the person who set himself on fire, had thrown numerous pamphlets around a park near the courthouse, authorities said.“The pamphlets appear to be propaganda-based, almost a conspiracy theory type of pamphlet,” NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny told reporters. ""So, a little bit of a conspiracy theory going on here.""Azzarello took out a canister from his bag containing what’s believed to be an alcohol-based accelerant, doused himself and set himself ablaze, police said.<h2>Trump has returned to the courtroom</h2>Trump is back in the courtroom as the trial resumes.

Police said they've spoken with his family, who were unaware he was in New York.<h2>Trump campaign comments on man who set himself on fire</h2>The Trump campaign released a statement this afternoon offering its ""condolences to the traumatized witnesses"" after a man set himself on fire outside the courthouse where the former president is on trial.“Not knowing the motivations behind this sickening situation, it’s difficult to make any definitive remarks, other than to say we are thankful that to the best of our present knowledge, nobody other than the individual in question was hurt,"" national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.She also thanked ""the great first responders of the City of New York for their actions.""""Today is more proof that our nation is in deep trouble,"" Leavitt added before using Trump's campaign slogan ""Make America Great Again.""<h2>Witness: Someone shouted, 'He's going to light himself on fire'</h2>Ed Quinn, a freelance photojournalist who lives in the East Village, said he was facing the court when “I heard someone scream, ‘He’s going to light himself on fire.’”“I see him dumping gasoline on his face, very deliberately,” he said. “He had gray T-shirt on. It soaked his face. It soaked his shirt. Boom, he went up.”Quinn said it took the police about a minute to arrive. “Women were begging, screaming, put it out, put him out,” he said.<h2>Trump on Truth Social: 'Judge Merchan is railroading me'</h2>In a new post on his social media network Truth Social, Trump accused Merchan of ""railroading"" him.“Judge Merchan is 'railroading' me, at breakneck speed, in order to completely satisfy his 'friends.' Additionally, he has 'GAGGED' me so that I cannot talk about the most important of topics,"" Trump said in his post.The former president also called President Joe Biden ""crooked"" and described this case as ""election interference.""<h2>Video shows man after setting himself on fire</h2>A video appears to show that moments after setting himself on fire, the man lay on the ground burning. At times, he appeared to seize. Police tried to use a small fire extinguisher to put the fire out, but were unsuccessful. While still on fire, the man tried to sit up. Police then used a large extinguisher to put out the fire.<h2>Injured man is being taken to a hospital, police say</h2>An injured man   is being placed in an ambulance   in critical condition and will be transported to a hospital, the New York City Police Department said Friday afternoon following reports that a person set themselves on fire outside the courthouse.Police said they responded at 1:37 p.m. to the vicinity of 80 Centre St. for an aided male.The fire is out, and the investigation is ongoing,   authorities added.<h2>Police responding to the man on fire outside the building</h2>The New York Police Department already had a heavy presence outside of the courthouse, due to the high profile of this case. As smoke emerged from the dedicated protest area, they rushed to find what looked like a fire extinguisher.<h2>A man set himself on fire outside the trial</h2>A man set himself on fire inside the designated protest area outside of the Trump trial in New York, a witness says.<h2>A person in the designated protest area is on fire</h2>There is a person who was in the designated protest area outside the courthouse who is on fire.<h2>Potential juror excused for past social media posts against Trump</h2>A potential juror was excused after Trump's attorneys and Merchan examined his past social media posts about Trump.“I don’t recall posting that,” the juror said. “That’s not mine.”Still, the juror added, “At that time, yeah I may have thought that,” before he was excused by the judge.<h2>Jury is complete</h2>The sixth alternate has been seated. <h2>Potential juror said Jan. 6 was an 'insurrection'</h2>A male prospective juror said the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol was an ""insurrection"" during voir dire with Trump's lawyer. When asked if he has strong opinions and about his posts about Trump, he said, “It’s more just the negative rhetoric and bias that he speaks about which is the most harmful.”Asked if the juror has expressed a strong dislike for Trump, he said, “Based on his rhetoric, yes.” He added that he would stay focused on “what is the law, what constitutes breaking the law?”<h2>One juror says he thinks of Trump as 'usually awesome'</h2>One juror, when questioned about how he views Trump, said that when he thinks of the former president, he thinks ""usually awesome.""""I don’t know him personally. He’s a family man. He’s a businessman,"" the juror also said about Trump.<h2>Trump gets inside look at potential voters</h2>Once again Trump is getting treated to a mini political focus group in this courtroom, getting an inside look at potential voters in the 2024 election. There are some potential jurors who said they support Trump's policies and find him to be a ""family man."" There is also at least one juror who said he has trouble with the Republican Party's positions on religion and women’s rights to control their own bodies. The trial continues to be a fascinating look at everyday New Yorkers for a presumptive GOP nominee thinking of how to message to voters this fall.<h2>Trump lawyer asks prospective juror, sexual assault survivor, if she would hold Trump's background against him</h2>A prospective juror, asked about her views of Trump, said, “His rhetoric, at times, causes people to feel enabled.”When asked what specifically about his rhetoric, she admitted she’s not even sure what his policies are, but noted that people have cited Trump in justifying their own racist, sexist or homophobic comments.Trump lawyer Susan Necheles then asked whether this prospective juror, an admitted survivor of sexual assault, would hold it against Trump that women — outside this case — have accused Trump of sexual assault. <h2>Another potential juror has been excused after expressing ‘anxiety’ about the trial</h2>Yet another potential juror has been excused from the trial after saying that she is feeling ""anxiety"" and self-doubt. The potential juror's voice cracked while answering questions. The juror is now the third to be excused Friday, underscoring the difficulty the court faces for picking Trump's jury. <h2>Juror breaks down crying during voir dire</h2>One of the jurors being questioned, who earlier said her father is friends with former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, broke down crying, saying, “I have to be honest, I feel so nervous and anxious right now. I’m sorry.""She added, ""I thought I could do this ... I don’t want you to feel like I’ve wasted anyone’s time.”Merchan called her over to the judge's bench to speak before excusing her.<h2>Prospective juror who served prison time dismissed</h2>A prospective juror who said she served two years in prison was dismissed by the judge who commended her bravery for sharing such personal details. Technically, she is ineligible to serve on the jury. “What you just did is something that most people in this courtroom would not be able to do,"" Merchan said to the juror. Merchan said that the mere fact that she was convicted does not preclude her from service, but that she needs a certificate of release to be qualified for service going forward and, even then, it will depend on the nature of the case. She was then excused and cheerfully called out, “Good luck!”<h2>Court back in session</h2>The jury selection process is resuming. <h2>10-minute break</h2>The court has taken a 10-minute break before questions for the alternate juror pool. <h2>Potential juror says he has been 'trying to find a wife' in his spare time</h2>One potential juror answered that his hobbies included ""trying to find a wife"" in his spare time. The insurance broker, who lives in Midtown East, also added that he has a few close friends who are court officers.<h2>Trump's interest piqued by juror who watches Fox News</h2>When a prospective juror said she is a Fox News viewer, Trump cocked his head, then quickly conferred with Blanche. The woman added she also reads The New York Times, New York Post and The Wall Street Journal. Trump resumed looking at her as she finished responding to the questionnaire. He appears most interested in jurors whose answers offer ambiguity around their personal political views.<h2>Potential juror says he listens to podcast, which has featured some Trump-supporting guests</h2>A potential juror who works in information technology and audio said that he listens to the ""Order of Man"" podcast, which happens to be very Joe Rogan-esque. The podcast has had some Trump-supporting guests on, including one man who ordered his financial company to stop doing business in New York after the fraud judgment against Trump. <h2>Potential juror details volunteering for Hillary Clinton campaign</h2>One juror told Merchan that he ""volunteered for get out the vote for the Democratic Party during the Clinton campaign."" The volunteer work would have taken place during the same election cycle when Trump beat Clinton to win the presidency.The potential juror added that he also ""attended the Women’s March.”<h2>A potential juror mentions Citizens United</h2>One juror, when asked by Merchan about whether they can be fair and impartial, brought up the landmark Supreme Court campaign finance case Citizens United, saying, ""Citizens United is the law of the land but I do favor people who make political contributions to have the source of the contributions made public.""“There is no reason why I can’t be a fair and impartial juror,” the person added.<h2>Potential juror says he doesn't use Facebook and only 'signed up in middle school'</h2>One potential juror, a younger man, said that he doesn't read or watch any news and while he has a Facebook account, he doesn't go on it.He said he ""signed up when I was in middle school or whatever."" <h2>Trump already sitting with his eyes shut</h2>The former president is sitting with his eyes shut and appears to be chewing on something as he sits at the defense table. <h2>First potential juror dismissed after saying she has anxiety</h2>The first potential juror questioned this morning was dismissed after saying she has anxiety and wouldn't be ""able to be completely here and fair.""“I have really really bad anxiety and people have found out where I am,"" she said earlier.<h2>Trump takes his seat in court</h2>Trump just took his seat in the courtroom in between his attorneys Emil Bove and Todd Blanche. He immediately began studying some documents in front of him and conferring with Bove. Still photographers were in for the daily photographs, several of them pressing up against the table to get close-ups. Merchan then took his seat on the bench, saying they were working on fixing the temperature in the courtroom, which was cold yesterday, before continuing jury selection.Trump's campaign spokesman, Steven Cheung, is in the back of the courtroom with lawyer Cliff Robert, who represents the Trump parties in the civil fraud case.All 22 prospective jurors are present. <h2>Trump says the gag order imposed on him needs to be removed</h2>As Trump entered the courthouse this morning, he said to the cameras that Merchan needs to remove the gag order against him because it's ""very, very unfair."" ""They've taken away my constitutional rights to speak,"" Trump said. ""Why am I gagged about telling the truth?""The former president repeated that he thinks the trial is ""rigged"" and is ""coming from the White House"" and said it's ""very unfair"" that he is required to sit in a courthouse all day instead of going to battleground states to campaign for president. ""The gag order has to come off,"" he said. <h2>Trump heads to court</h2>The former president's motorcade has departed Trump Tower and is headed to the courthouse.<h2>Judge denies Trump co-defendants’ motions to dismiss charges in classified documents case</h2>U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon yesterday denied motions by two of Trump's co-defendants to dismiss charges in the classified documents case — one of the four criminal cases, along with the hush money trial, that the former president is facing.Trump aide Walt Nauta’s lawyers asked this month for five charges against him to be dismissed, while lawyers for Carlos De Oliveira, who was the property manager at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s Florida estate, requested that all charges against him be tossed out.In her filing in Florida, Cannon said De Oliveira “does not meaningfully dispute that the charging document satisfies the minimum pleading standards.” She also noted that his lawyers can challenge prosecutors’ evidence during a trial, “where the Special Counsel will bear the entire burden of proof as to all essential elements of the obstruction offenses.”Similarly, she dismissed the motion from Nauta’s lawyers, who had argued that obstruction charges against him were  unconstitutionally vague .<h2>Alternate jurors and key legal arguments on tap in Trump hush money trial</h2>Jury selection will continue — and could conclude — today in  Trump ‘s historic New York criminal trial.With a full 12-person jury and one alternate juror  sworn in  yesterday, Merchan has called a pool of 96 potential jurors to his Manhattan courtroom in hope of finding five more alternate jurors for the first  trial of a former president , which is expected to last roughly six weeks. In addition to those 96 potential jurors, there are 22 left over from yesterday who will be questioned, as well.If the effort to fill the jury box is successful, opening statements could take place as soon as Monday. <h2>Trump’s curiosity with jurors ebbs and flows during final stage of selection process. Here’s what you missed on trial Day 3.</h2>Jury selection in Trump’s  hush money trial  yesterday revealed there are certain topics that are likely to capture his attention: Miami, real estate and media.When one New Yorker talked about his decades in law enforcement, Trump raised his eyebrows. The juror, who said he holds Yankees season tickets, added that he reads the New York Post and Daily News. It was as if Trump, who moments earlier let out a yawn, was seized by an electrical current.Later, Trump straightened his back and cocked his chin as a young lawyer, born and raised in Miami, began running through her answers to the jury questionnaire. Asked whether she had been the victim of a crime, the woman said her phone was stolen from her in Paris, and she noted that her family’s car was “incidentally burned in an arson in Italy.” ",2024-04-20 01:16:00 AM EEST,NBC,Highlights from Day 4 of Trump’s hush money trial,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/live-blog/trump-hush-money-trial-day-4-live-updates-rcna145937
