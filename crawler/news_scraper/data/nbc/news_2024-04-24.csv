"Berkeley Lovelace Jr.,Christine Romans,Jessica Herzberg","Despite Eli Lilly’s assurances about an ample supply of its new weight loss drug  Zepbound , the company is now facing widespread shortages just months after its approval. While the drugmaker is working to resolve the issue, a quick fix is unlikely, it says, with no immediate end to the shortage in sight.The Food and Drug Administration  approved Zepbound  in November, introducing a new competitor to Novo Nordisk’s  blockbuster weight loss drug Wegovy . Zepbound officially went into shortage in April, according to the FDA, mere months after Lilly CEO Dave Ricks  told NBC News  that supply of the drug was not a concern. As of Wednesday, all but one dosage was listed as in “limited availability” through the end of June on  the FDA’s website .Lilly is blaming the shortage on the huge demand for the drug, saying it can’t produce enough to meet everyone’s needs for diabetes and for weight loss.  Zepbound  is the same drug as the company’s diabetes medication Mounjaro, but rebranded for weight loss. Both contain the active ingredient tirzepatide.Like Zepbound, all but one dosage of Mounjaro is in shortage, according to the FDA. “For the near term, we are going to be in this limited availability, which may cause delays across some of the doses for both Mounjaro and Zepbound,” said Rhonda Pacheco, Lilly’s group vice president for diabetes and obesity. “We are working so hard every day to make sure that we increase that capacity as fast as we can to get these medications in patients’ hands.”It’s unclear when exactly that will be.To increase supply, Lilly said it plans to open a new manufacturing facility in Concord, North Carolina, by the end of the year, dedicated to making  Zepbound and Mounjaro , as well as a similar diabetes drug called Trulicity. The company declined to share specifics on how much of the medication it expects it will be able to produce. Edgardo Hernandez, who heads global manufacturing at Lilly, said patients can expect to see products from the plant on pharmacy shelves “sometime next year.”‘Immensely disruptive’The shortage means people like Amanda Cella, a 37-year-old South Jersey resident, have to scramble to find a pharmacy that still has the drug in stock.Cella was prescribed Zepbound in February. She may not be able to fill her prescription this month, however.She’s contacted mom-and-pop shops, as well as retail and hospital pharmacies in New Jersey and Philadelphia, but none had the drug.“I wish I were exaggerating when I say I called every Walmart pharmacy in the state of New Jersey,” she said.The drug appears to be available on Lilly’s telehealth platform LillyDirect, Cella said, but it’s on backorder and she doesn’t know when it’ll ship. She said she has enough doses to cover a few more weeks, but if she can’t find more, she’ll consider getting the drug from a  compound pharmacy , which can come with risks like incorrect dosing or contamination.“It’s very frustrating,” Cella said.Dr. Christopher McGowan, a gastroenterologist who runs a weight loss clinic in Cary, North Carolina, said that patients who miss more than two weeks of a weight loss drug may be forced to start their treatment over again at the lowest dose and then gradually increase over several weeks, in order to  reacclimate to the side effects .Starting over can be “immensely disruptive” and “demoralizing” for patients who have successfully lost weight on the drugs, he said. “For one, it is stressful for the patient, who may have to scramble and hunt for a pharmacy that stocks their dose,” he said. “Likewise, it’s time-consuming for clinicians and medical teams to assist.”What’s more, abruptly stopping a weight loss drug could put patients  at risk of weight gain , McGowan said. “Many patients will report a rise in hunger after missing only one or two doses of medication,” he said.Debbie Foley, 56, of Los Angeles, said her hunger levels have gone up since she’s had to lower her dosage of Mounjaro over the past two months, unable to fill her usual prescription. She’s been taking the drug for both diabetes and weight loss.“It’s been a great drug,” Foley said. “I know that people know that and that’s why everybody wants it, but hate when they just say, ‘Well, we just can’t manufacture it fast enough.’ Like, what’s the deal?”‘Be prepared’Lilly has opted to continue to allow new patients to start on Zepbound, rather than attempting to limit the supply to current users, something that  Novo Nordisk did last year  at the height of Wegovy’s shortage by restricting the supply of the lowest dose. Limiting this so-called starter dose meant that many new patients could not start treatment with Wegovy.“We believe that decision is one between a patient and their health care provider,” Pacheco said. “I always say: Be aware and be prepared,” she said. “When you get put on a treatment like Mounjaro or Zepbound, really making sure that you’re aware of the limited availability.” Lilly has a  website  where patients can track supply of the drug. Still, some doctors have had to switch patients to different drugs because of the shortage.Dr. Scott Butsch, director of obesity medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, has had patients who couldn’t find Zepbound switch to other weight loss medications, like Wegovy.There are no strict guidelines for switching between Zepbound and Wegovy, or vice versa, said Butsch, who is currently a principal investigator on a clinical trial for a different Lilly weight loss drug.  Some doctors may have their patient taper off of one medication; others may immediately start them on the new drug, he said. That decision is typically left to the discretion of the doctor.“Some people felt different. Some people had a decrease in side effects. Other people didn’t feel as well. What we know from switching back and forth is it depends on the person,” he said.McGowan, who runs the weight loss clinic in North Carolina, switched one of his patients, 38-year-old Kathryn Davies, from Wegovy to Zepbound late last year. Davies said she had limited success with Wegovy, but Zepbound worked much better. Then last month, her pharmacy ran out of the drug and told her it didn’t know when it would get it back in stock. “It’s definitely a bit of a panic moment,” she said. “I’ve struggled for 30 years before I found a solution that really felt like a cure, as long as I kept taking it. So it’s sort of disorienting.” ",2024-04-18 14:00:00 PM EEST,NBC,"As Zepbound shortage grows, Eli Lilly says no immediate end is in sight",https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/zepbound-shortage-eli-lilly-weight-loss-drug-rcna148232
Matt Lavietes,"Scotland’s sole clinic for treating transgender youths announced Thursday that it is pausing new prescriptions of puberty blockers for minors.Sandyford, a health clinic in Glasgow operated by Scotland’s National Health Service,  said in a statement  that it is indefinitely pausing new prescriptions of the medication for people under 18 who are experiencing “gender incongruence.” Patients who are already undergoing treatment will not be affected. “We are committed to providing the best possible clinical care for young people accessing and understand the distress that gender incongruence can cause,” the clinic said. “While this pause is in place, we will continue to give anyone who is referred into the Young People Gender Service the psychological support that they require while we review the pathways in line with the findings.”The announcement comes less than two weeks after a report commissioned by England’s National Health Service concluded that the medical evidence around transition-related care for minors is “remarkably weak” and that more research is needed. The report, known as the  Cass Review , was funded by the NHS and independently led by prominent British pediatrician Dr. Hilary Cass.In March, prior to the release of the full report, England’s NHS said it would stop new prescriptions of puberty blockers. Public health officials in Scotland cited the Cass Review for their reasoning, saying it would be working with England’s NHS to “generate evidence of safety and long-term impact for therapies.”“The Cass Review is a significant piece of work into how the NHS can better support children and young people who present with gender dysphoria,” Tracey Gillies, executive medical director at NHS Lothian, one of the 14 regional divisions of NHS Scotland, said in a statement. “Patient safety must always be our priority and it is right that we pause this treatment to allow more research to be carried out.”Scottish Trans, a division of Scotland’s Equality Network that focuses on trans rights, said that Scottish health officials were making the “wrong decision, and that it will harm trans children and young people.”“This decision has been taken within the context where the reality of trans people’s experiences and lives is questioned almost daily in some of the media and some political circles,” the group said in a statement. “This makes us worry that the decision has been influenced by that context rather than solely through consideration of the best interests of trans children and young people.”Puberty blockers — which have been used for decades to delay puberty in children who were developing too quickly — are now typically prescribed to prevent the onset of puberty for youths questioning their gender identities. The drugs also give youths greater time to decide whether to pursue more permanent treatments like hormone replacement therapy and transition-related surgeries.Nearly all of the  major medical associations  in the United States have come out in favor of transition-related care, including puberty blockers, for the physical and mental well-being of transgender minors. Twenty-three U.S. states have enacted bans on gender-affirming care, including the prescription of puberty blockers, according to the  Movement Advancement Project , a think tank that tracks policies affecting LGBTQ Americans. Health care providers in five states — Florida, Alabama, Oklahoma, North Dakota and Idaho — could be charged with a felony for providing gender-affirming care to trans minors, according to MAP.",2024-04-18 19:14:00 PM EEST,NBC,Scotland pauses prescriptions of puberty blockers for transgender minors,https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-health-and-wellness/scotland-pauses-prescriptions-puberty-blockers-transgender-minors-rcna148366
"Erika Edwards,Marina Kopf","BOISE, Idaho — Alarm bells ring in Matt Murray’s head when a prescription for misoprostol comes through his independent pharmacy in Boise, Idaho.“Are there directions on the prescription that show what it’s being used for?” said Murray, a pharmacist and director of operations for Customedica Pharmacy. “If not, then we would probably need to call the [doctor’s] office and confirm why it’s being prescribed.”The medication is legal — approved by the Food and Drug Administration to prevent stomach ulcers — but it can also be used for abortions, which became illegal in Idaho with few exceptions when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. When that happened, misoprostol went from “something that wasn’t on the radar but now sends up an alert in the pharmacy,” Murray said.Misoprostol, which works by contracting the uterus, is also commonly used ahead of gynecologic procedures, such as the insertion of intrauterine devices for birth control, or after miscarriages, when pregnancies end on their own. The drug helps speed up the time it takes for a woman's body to expel the failed pregnancy.Murray’s hesitation in dispensing misoprostol isn’t based on personal feelings about abortion. It’s the fear of legal action or jail time.Idaho’s “ Defense of Life Act ” says any person who performs or assists in an abortion could face felony criminal charges and up to five years in prison. Exceptions include to save the life of the woman and in cases of rape or incest. Does that mean pharmacists could be liable for dispensing a drug that could be used in an abortion — even if it’s not? Pharmacists like Murray in Idaho aren’t sure.“The law isn’t clear whether a pharmacist is committing a felony for dispensing the medication,” he said. “What level of due diligence are we expected to perform?” Alison Tanner, senior legal counsel at the National Women’s Law Center, said, “Pharmacists are understandably scared by these incredibly strict abortion laws that have been enacted, and they are afraid that they might be charged with a felony simply for doing their job.” In some cases, pharmacists have refused to prescribe misoprostol, no matter its purpose.The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services told NBC News it isn’t able to confirm the number of complaints it has received from women who have been denied prescribed medications.  In a  public statement  last year , Melanie Fontes Rainer, director of HHS’ Office for Civil Rights, acknowledged that women across the country have faced delays in getting medication even when they weren't seeking abortions.“The overturning of Roe v. Wade is causing chaos in our healthcare system, including in our pharmacies, where healthcare providers are suddenly being asked to not only provide healthcare, but also become legal experts in navigating the patchwork of abortion bans,” Rainier wrote in a statement. The Idaho Board of Pharmacy said that because of the “uniqueness of every situation,” it isn’t providing guidance for its pharmacists who dispense medications that could be used to terminate a pregnancy.“Pharmacists licensed in Idaho are expected to comply with the law. Idaho law, in most circumstances, prohibits abortion,” a board representative wrote in an email, adding that “abortion does not mean the removal of a dead unborn child or the treatment of a woman who is no longer pregnant.”Kristin Colson, 36, of Boise, experienced her own distressing delay. When she and her husband, Loren, realized she was having a miscarriage in January, her doctor prescribed misoprostol. The natural process of a miscarriage can be unpredictable, and it can take months, but misoprostol helps speed it. It was the couple’s fifth pregnancy loss. Kristin had used the drug successfully in the past.“Everybody processes grief differently. But for me, I like to have a plan,” Colson said. “Choosing to use the medication, I can time when this happens.” She waited more than a day to hear back from her local Walgreens, she said. When she called to ask about the status of her order, the pharmacist, Colson said, told her that he “didn’t feel comfortable filling the misoprostol prescription at that dosage, given the Idaho laws.”The response was a shock, she said. “It’s a tough time. You’re trying to process your loss. And I was frustrated, confused,” Colson said. “You just want to move on.”Loren Colson, also 36, said: “We’re trying to start a family. We’re not old, but we’re not young, either. We are on a little bit of a timeline if we want to start our family. It really impacts us, any delay in that process.” In a statement, Walgreens said that while it doesn’t require “pharmacists with moral objections to dispense reproductive medications,” it actively works to make sure other pharmacists are available to fill prescriptions.Another Walgreens ultimately filled Kristin Colson’s misoprostol prescription. But the concern among pharmacists remains.“Ultimately, the fear is that people aren’t getting the medical care that they’re needing,” Murray said.",2024-04-19 01:24:00 AM EEST,NBC,Some pharmacists fear jail time over murky abortion laws,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/abortion-ban-pill-misoprostol-rules-pharmacists-rcna148359
Aria Bendix,"A  number  of  studies  have  suggested  that eating only during a limited window of time can help some people lose weight. But it's unclear why: Does the strategy just help people eat less, or is there something beneficial about keeping meals within a shorter time frame? New research falls in the former camp, suggesting that the amount of calories people consume matters more than the timing. A small, randomized trial at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine — the results of which were published Friday in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine — found that when researchers controlled the number of calories people consumed, both time-restricted and regular eating schedules resulted in similar degrees of weight loss. “It makes us think that people who benefit from time-restricted eating — meaning they lose weight — it’s probably from them eating fewer calories because their time window’s shorter and not something else,” said the study’s lead author, Dr. Nisa Maruthur, an associate professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University.Time-restricted eating regimens vary, and some are similar to intermittent fasting, a type of diet that involves alternating between periods of fasting and eating. The new trial looked at a 10-hour eating window, which is longer than what would typically qualify as intermittent fasting. The researchers supplied 41 people with prepared meals for 12 weeks. The participants, most of them Black women, had obesity and were either prediabetic or diabetic. Their meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner and a snack) were designed to contain the same number of calories they ate in their daily lives, based on their age, sex, weight, height and level of physical activity. The food had a healthy balance of fat, carbohydrates and protein. On a given day, participants might have cereal and a fruit cup for breakfast, a kale salad with white beans and lentils for lunch, peanuts or mandarin oranges for a snack and a beef stew for dinner.Half the group ate meals over a 10-hour window, from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Around 80% of their calories were consumed at breakfast and lunch, because some research has suggested that eating most of your calories early in the day could be  beneficial for weight loss . The other half ate from 8 a.m. to midnight and consumed half of their daily calories at dinner — a schedule meant to mimic many people’s eating patterns outside a research setting. During the eating windows, the trial didn’t limit beverages if they were calorie- and caffeine-free. Participants were also each allowed one cup of coffee, diet soda and alcoholic beverage per day. Outside the designated time periods, only water was allowed.At the end of the study, participants lost roughly the same amount of weight regardless of which regimen they followed. The average in the time-restricted eating group was around 5.1 pounds lost, compared to 5.7 pounds for the other group. There were no significant differences in blood sugar, blood pressure, waist circumference or lipid levels. The results were similar to the findings of a  randomized trial last year , which found that intermittent fasting was  similar to calorie counting  as a weight loss strategy. However, research overall on time-restricted eating is mixed: A  six-year study  didn’t find a link between weight change and  limiting food intake  to a specific time window.The new trial was distinctive in that the researchers controlled what all participants ate — a rarer and more complex experiment design.But its results come with a few caveats, said Dr. Lisa Chow, a professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota who wasn’t involved in the study.The trial may not have captured the long-term benefits of time-restricted eating, she said.  One of her own studies , published last year, found that six months of time-restricted eating — from noon to 8 p.m. daily — was more effective for weight loss than calorie restriction in people with Type 2 diabetes.What's more, Chow added, the trial didn’t reflect what time-restricted eating looks like in real life, because it controlled people’s calories and meals.  “When you’re talking about the doctor talking to a patient about weight loss, it’s not the same thing, because the doctor isn’t going to provide all the food,” she said.Other researchers also think meal timing matters for weight loss.According to Satchin Panda, a professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, the ideal time-restricted eating schedule involves waiting an hour or two after you wake up to have your first meal, then consuming your last meal three hours before bedtime.“It doesn’t depend on the world clock — it depends on your internal clock,” Panda said. “A person who wakes up at 6 a.m., it may be OK for them to start at 8 a.m. But the person who wakes up at 8 a.m. may start eating at 9 or 10 a.m.”That’s because the stress hormone cortisol is high after you wake up, and melatonin — a hormone that regulates sleep — is still declining at that time. So it may be more difficult for people to properly digest soon after they arise, Panda said. Eating close to bedtime, meanwhile, can disturb sleep, and insufficient sleep may increase cravings, Panda added. Some  research  also suggests that late-night eating could cause people to store more energy as fat.Time-restricted eating may offer benefits other than weight loss, as well.Panda’s research  has found that the approach may reduce so-called “bad cholesterol” and improve blood pressure and blood sugar in people with certain chronic health conditions.On the other hand, a study published last month found that restricting food consumption to less than eight hours per day  may increase the risk of cardiovascular death  long-term.At the very least, Panda said, time-restricted eating may offer a simpler alternative to calorie counting.“It’s easier to count time than count calories,” he said. “I’d guess that most people cannot remember how many calories they’ve consumed, but timing is easy to remember.”",2024-04-19 16:00:00 PM EEST,NBC,Eating within limited hours can help with weight loss — but that may be because it simply cuts calories,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/why-eating-time-restricted-helps-weight-loss-rcna148041
Lawrence Hurley,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Wednesday grapples with whether provisions of Idaho's near-total abortion ban unlawfully conflict with a federal law aimed at ensuring certain standards for emergency medical care for patients, including pregnant women.The justices are weighing an appeal brought by Idaho officials who are contesting a lawsuit filed by the Biden administration over abortion access in emergency situations.The state abortion law was enacted in 2020, with a provision stating it would go into effect if the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that found women had a constitutional right to abortion.The 2020 law, called the Defense of Life Act,  went into effect  in 2022 when the Supreme Court  rolled back  Roe. The state law says that anyone who performs an abortion is subject to criminal penalties, including up to five years in prison. Health care professionals found to have violated the law can lose their professional licenses.There is an exception if an abortion is necessary to protect the life of the pregnant woman.The federal government sued, leading a federal judge in August 2022 to block the state from enforcing provisions concerning medical care that is required under the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA).The federal law, enacted in 1986, requires that patients receive appropriate emergency room care. The Biden administration argues that care should include abortions in certain situations. The law applies to any hospital that receives federal funding under the Medicare program.In January, the Supreme Court  allowed  Idaho to enforce the provisions while also agreeing to hear oral arguments in the case. Other provisions of the ban are already in effect and will not be affected by how the justices rule.The decision will affect not just Idaho but also other states, including Texas, that have enacted similar abortion bans that abortion rights advocates say clash with the federal law.In blocking parts of the state law that conflict with federal law, U.S. District Court Judge B. Lynn Winmill described the state’s actions as putting doctors in a difficult situation.“The doctor believes her EMTALA obligations require her to offer that abortion right now. But she also knows that all abortions are banned in Idaho. She thus finds herself on the horns of a dilemma. Which law should she violate?” he wrote.The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals briefly put Winmill’s ruling on hold in September, but subsequently allowed it to go back into effect, prompting the state officials to turn to the Supreme Court.Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, representing the Biden administration, wrote in court papers that EMTALA requires ""necessary stabilizing treatment,"" which in cases involving pregnant women in an emergency situation may require an abortion.""And in those limited but critically important circumstances EMTALA requires the hospital to offer that care,"" she added.The state abortion ban's exception for the health of the pregnant woman is too narrow, Prelogar said, as it only allows for doctors to perform abortions when the patient is at risk of death, ""not merely to avoid grave harm to health.""Dr. Jim Souza, who heads the St. Luke’s ​​Health System in Idaho, said on a call with reporters that the system had pregnant patients with serious complications on 54 occasions last year.After the state law went into effect, ""there's a lot of second-guessing and hand-wringing"" among doctors deciding how to treat patients in those circumstances, he added. On some occasions, women are transferred to a state where abortions are legal in order to avoid potential prosecution, Souza said.The state argues that it was only after Roe was overturned that the Biden administration said EMTALA could be interpreted to require abortions in some contexts, calling it a ""nationwide abortion mandate.""EMTALA ""merely prohibits emergency rooms from turning away indigent patients with serious medical conditions,"" Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador wrote in court papers. The law was not intended to override state laws regulating health care, he added.Katie Daniel, a lawyer with Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, an anti-abortion group, said that all states that ban abortion allow pregnant women to get emergency treatment but that Biden administration officials ""want to open the door"" to abortions being available in a ""broad array of circumstances.""The Idaho dispute is one of two abortion cases now pending at the Supreme Court, both of which arose in the aftermath of the 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. In the other case, the court is considering  a challenge  that could restrict access to mifepristone, the drug most commonly used for medication abortions.",2024-04-24 13:59:00 PM EEST,NBC,Supreme Court hears abortion clash over emergency room treatment for pregnant women,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-hears-abortion-clash-emergency-room-treatment-pregnant-w-rcna148863
Elizabeth Chuck,"Trader Joe’s has recalled packaged herbs linked to a multistate salmonella outbreak, the grocery chain announced this week.The product, Infinite Herbs organic basil, was sold in 2.5-ounce clamshell containers from Feb. 1 to April 6  in 29 states, as well as in Washington, D.C.,  Trader Joe’s said Wednesday. There have been 12 reports in seven states of people being infected with salmonella, an organism that can cause serious or fatal illness,  according to federal officials . One person was hospitalized.“Seven of eight cases with information available reported exposure to fresh organic basil purchased from Trader Joe’s before becoming ill,” the Food and Drug Administration said on its website, adding that “traceback data” it had collected determined that Florida-based Infinite Herbs had supplied the basil to Trader Joe’s.Grego Berliavsky, the head of Infinite Herbs, said Wednesday that the company had voluntarily recalled the product. “I am heartbroken at the thought that any item we sold may have caused illness or discomfort,” he said in a  statement . “We simply will not rest until we can once again be confident in the safety of this product.”Berliavsky added that customers should check their freezers for the basil.“Fresh basil naturally wilts and expires after five to seven days, so we are confident that the recalled basil is no longer available for sale,” he wrote. “However, if you have food in your freezer that includes Infinite Herbs organic basil purchased between February 1 and April 6, do not consume it.”The basil had been sourced from a single farm, which is no longer in production, Berliavsky said.“We are working with the farmer to conduct an internal investigation of the food safety practices. Through this investigation, our goal is to determine the cause of this recall and apply measures to prevent it from happening again,” he wrote.Symptoms  of salmonella include diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The symptoms usually start six hours to six days after infection, and while most people recover within a week without antibiotics, some may need medical treatment. The CDC says that children younger than 5, adults 65 and older and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to get serious salmonella infections but that anyone who has severe diarrhea, bloody stools, a fever higher than 102 degrees or prolonged vomiting may need antibiotics or to be hospitalized.Salmonella causes about 1.35 million infections, 26,500 hospitalizations and 420 deaths in the U.S. every year,  according to the CDC . But official counts are likely to be an underestimate because most people recover without seeking medical help or without confirmed diagnoses, said Barbara Kowalcyk, an associate professor of exercise and nutrition sciences at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. Infections come from a variety of sources, including consuming contaminated food and water or touching infected animals and their environments.In rare cases, salmonella or its toxins can enter the bloodstream, causing serious illnesses, death or long-term conditions like arthritis, Kowalcyk said.""One of the things in food safety that we try to do is make people aware that it's not just this bad tummy ache,"" she said. ""There are other health implications.""Salmonella is not visible, and it cannot be smelled or tasted, Kowalcyk said. Trader Joe’s instructed customers to discard the packaged basil or to return it for a full refund. The FDA said infections have been reported in Florida, Georgia, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Wisconsin; the product was also distributed in Alabama, Connecticut, Washington, D.C., Delaware, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, North Carolina, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and Vermont.The news comes a month after another large Trader Joe’s recall involving potential salmonella contamination. In March, the grocer  recalled cashews sold in 16 states . No illnesses were reported in that instance. Earlier in March, Trader Joe’s recalled  steamed chicken soup dumplings  that federal officials said could be contaminated with “hard plastic from a permanent marker pen.”",2024-04-18 19:17:00 PM EEST,NBC,Salmonella outbreak prompts Trader Joe's to recall herbs sold in 29 states,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/salmonella-outbreak-prompts-trader-joes-recall-herbs-sold-29-states-rcna148356
"Aria Bendix,Katie Mogg","How old is considered old?The answer to that question appears to be changing as people live longer, retire later and maintain higher levels of physical and mental health into their older years.A study  published Monday  suggests that people in their mid-60s believe old age starts at 75 — but the older people get, the later they think it begins. The research, published in the American Psychological Association’s Psychology and Aging journal, examined data from around 14,000 participants in the German Aging Survey, which studies old age as a stage of life in Germany. The participants were born between 1911 and 1974 and entered the survey at ages 40 to 85. The people studied reported their perceptions of old age up to eight times over 25 years. For every four to five years that passed, participants reported that old age started a year later compared to their last assessment.Participants who were born earlier — from 1911 to 1935 — thought that old age started earlier compared with participants born after 1935. “Our perceptions or conceptions of old age are obviously shifting across historical time. People nowadays who are in midlife or who are older adults believe that old age begins later than did their peers 10 or 20 years ago,” said Markus Wettstein, the study’s lead author and a psychologist at Humboldt University of Berlin.Wettstein said the change could be due, in part, to increases in life expectancy: German life expectancy is  around 81 years at birth , up from 71 years in 1974. Many people in Germany are also living healthier lives for longer. Studies have shown improvements in  heart health ,  cognitive abilities  and  overall quality of life  in the country's older population over time. “People who feel younger also believe that old age starts later,” Wettstein said.Participants in the study who were lonelier, had more chronic diseases or reported being in poorer health were more likely to believe that old age started earlier. Women, on average, thought that old age started around 2.4 years later than men did.However, Jacqui Smith, a psychology professor at the University of Michigan who was not involved in the research, cautioned that the results may not apply to other countries, since cultural views of aging and historical trends vary between communities. In the U.S., for instance, life expectancy declined during the Covid pandemic, from 79 years in 2019 to 76 in 2021 — whereas Germany's life expectancy has been fairly consistent since 2014.Still, Smith said, the study offers insight into how people's perspectives on aging change as they get older.“A lot of the work that we see in the literature is only taking a single snapshot of this phenomenon, a single point in time,” she said. “What this study is adding is that it’s comparing different people who were born at different times who’ve clearly gone through many different historical changes in their life.”John Rowe, a professor of health policy and aging at Columbia University, said he found the results encouraging.“I would say that this confirms in a very strong way, at least in Germany, that 70 is the new 60,” said Rowe, who also wasn’t involved in the study.He theorized that people may be starting to shed some negative stereotypes about older people and view them instead as more capable or agile than in the past. However, both Rowe and Wettstein also said that some people in the study may have deliberately excluded themselves from the old age category because they saw it as undesirable.“Some people have such a negative views of the elderly that they don’t want to be associated with them,” Rowe said. “So if they’re 70 years old, they’ll say old age begins at 75. And when they get to 75, they’ll say old age begins at 80.”Of course, age doesn’t always correlate with health status.“We can’t equate any sort of general transition in age to the way that people are actually functioning,” Smith said. However, people’s perceptions of aging could affect their health. Past research has shown that negative beliefs about getting older are  linked to higher stress levels , which in turn may increase the risk of heart attack or stroke. Studies have conversely shown that people with positive views of aging are  less likely to develop dementia  and  tend to live longer  than people with more negative views of aging. People who see themselves as younger than their actual age have also exhibited  slower memory declines ,  better cognitive performance and reduced symptoms of depression , while people who perceive themselves as older have a  higher risk of mortality .",2024-04-23 00:20:00 AM EEST,NBC,When does 'old age' begin?

Denise Chow,"Federal officials on Monday unveiled a set of tools aimed at helping protect people in the United States from the  dangers of extreme heat .The resources, developed jointly by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, include new color-coded heat forecasts and a public dashboard showing local heat risks and air quality levels.  New guidelines were also released for clinicians , instructing them on how to educate patients about coping with heat waves and the health impacts of extreme heat.The tools are part of a broader government initiative to better prepare the country for heat waves, which are increasing in frequency, intensity and duration as a result of climate change. Officials said these efforts are geared at raising awareness among those who are particularly vulnerable to extreme heat, including seniors, pregnant women, people with asthma, young children and individuals with certain underlying health conditions.Among the new tools is an experimental system from NOAA called “ HeatRisk ,” which provides a seven-day heat forecast for locations across the contiguous U.S. A numerical and color-coded scale shows users the potential dangers of heat and humidity in their area. That resource is designed to be used in conjunction with a new dashboard from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which allows people to enter their zip code to see real-time and forecasted heat risks and air quality information. Together, the tools and guidelines can, for instance, help people identify a location to stay cool if they don’t have working air conditioning, recognize symptoms of heat-related illness or understand how their medications may interact with heat, CDC director Mandy Cohen said Monday in a news briefing.“Heat can impact our health, but heat-related illness and death are preventable,” Cohen said.Heat kills more people in the U.S. each year  than any other extreme weather event, including floods, hurricanes and tornadoes. Last year was the  planet’s warmest on record , and the summer was brutally hot for huge swaths of the U.S., particularly across the South and Southwest. NOAA officials said they hope the new resources will help communities plan for the upcoming summer months. The agency has said it expects temperatures for much of the U.S. in May and June to be above average, ahead of what is expected to be another hot summer across the country.“When it comes to heat, it’s never too early to prepare,” NOAA administrator Rick Spinrad said in the briefing.On NOAA's HeatRisk tool, the scale ranges from 0 or green, meaning little or no risk from expected heat, to 4 or magenta, which indicates extreme and/or long-duration heat-related impacts.The risk levels account for the projected high and low temperatures, and factor in the cumulative impacts of heat over daytime and nighttime conditions, according to NOAA. The outlooks are designed to be personalized by location, since a 100-degree Fahrenheit day in Miami will feel different from a 100-degree day in Phoenix, for example.The forecasts also include historical context to help people understand how unusual the projected temperatures will be for any given time of year. Ken Graham, director of NOAA’s National Weather Service, said the tools could help users plan when to limit time outdoors or put off certain strenuous activities. The idea is to give people more context to supplement the heat watches and warnings that the agency issues, he added.NOAA said the National Weather Service initially developed a prototype of the HeatRisk tool for California in 2013. In 2017, the project was expanded to include all Western states, and it is now available experimentally across the contiguous U.S. Members of the public can  submit feedback  on the tool to the National Weather Service through Sept. 30.",2024-04-22 23:09:00 PM EEST,NBC,New tools from NOAA and CDC show people their risk from heat as another hot summer looms,https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/heat-forecast-tools-noaa-cdc-show-risk-rcna147909
Liz Szabo,"Hospitalized women are less likely to die or be readmitted to the hospital if they are treated by female doctors, a study published Monday in the  Annals of Internal Medicine  found. In the study of people ages 65 and older, 8.15% of  women treated by female physicians  died within 30 days, compared with 8.38% of women treated by male physicians. Although the difference between the two groups seems small, the researchers say erasing the gap could save 5,000 women’s lives each year. The study included nearly 800,000 male and female patients hospitalized from 2016 through 2019. All patients were covered by Medicare. For male hospitalized patients, the gender of the doctor didn’t appear to have an effect on risk of death or hospital readmission.The data alone doesn’t explain why women fare better when treated by other women. But other studies suggest that women are less likely to experience “miscommunication, misunderstanding and bias” when treated by female doctors, said lead study author Dr. Atsushi Miyawaki, a senior assistant professor of health services research at the University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine.The new research is part of a growing field of study examining why women and minorities tend to receive worse medical care than men and white patients. For example, women and  minority patients  are up to 30%  more likely to be misdiagnosed  than white men.“Our pain and our symptoms are often dismissed,” said Dr. Megan Ranney, dean of the Yale School of Public Health. “It may be that women physicians are more aware of that and are more empathetic.”Research shows that women are less likely than men to receive intensive care but more likely to report having negative experiences with health care, having their concerns dismissed, and having their heart or pain symptoms ignored, the authors wrote in the new study. Male physicians are also more likely than female doctors  to underestimate women’s risk of stroke .Part of the problem, Miyawaki said, is that medical students get “limited training in women’s health issues.”Dr. Ronald Wyatt, who is Black, said his 27-year-old daughter recently had trouble getting an accurate diagnosis for her shortness of breath. An emergency room physician told her the problem was caused by asthma. It took two more trips to the emergency room for his daughter to learn that she actually had a blood clot in her lungs, a potentially life-threatening situation.“There is a tendency for doctors to harbor sexist stereotypes about women, regardless of age, such as the notion that women’s symptoms are more emotional or their pain is less severe or more psychological in origin,” said Wyatt, former chief science and chief medical officer at the Society to Improve Diagnosis in Medicine, a nonprofit research and advocacy group.Women seem to experience fewer of these problems when treated by other women.For example, a study published  JAMA Surgery in 2021  found that women patients developed fewer complications if their surgeon was female. Another  JAMA Surgery study published in 2023  found all patients had fewer complications and shorter hospital stays if they were operated on by female surgeons, who worked more slowly than their male counterparts.Women primary care doctors also tend to  spend more time with their patients , Ranney said. Although that extra attention is great for patients, it also means that women see fewer patients per day and earn less, on average, than male doctors.Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, said several studies suggest that female doctors  follow medical evidence and guidelines , and that their patients  have better outcomes. “There’s lots of variation between women and men physicians,” said Jha, who was not involved in the new study. Women “tend to be better at communication, listening to patients, speaking openly. Patients report that communication is better. You put these things together, and you can understand why there are small but important differences.”The authors of the study said it’s also possible that women are more forthcoming about sensitive issues with female physicians, allowing them to make more informed diagnoses.That doesn’t mean that women should switch doctors, said Dr. Preeti Malani, a professor of medicine at the University of Michigan. For an individual patient, the differences in mortality and readmission rates seen in the new study are tiny.“It would be a mistake to suggest that people need to find physicians of the same gender or race as themselves,” Jha said. “The bigger issue is that we need to understand why these differences exist.”Malani said she’s curious about what women doctors are doing to prevent patients from needing to be readmitted soon after discharge. “How much care and thought is going into that discharge plan?” Malani asked. “Is that where women are succeeding? What can we learn about cultural humility and asking the right questions?”Others aren’t convinced that the new study proves a physician’s gender makes a big difference.Few hospitalized patients are treated by a single doctor, said Dr. Hardeep Singh, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and a patient safety researcher at the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center.Hospital patients are treated by teams of physicians, especially if they need specialist care, in addition to nurses and other professionals, Singh said.“How often do you see the same doc every day in the hospital?” Singh asked. “The point is that it’s not a one-man or one-woman show. Outcomes are unlikely to depend on one individual, but rather on a clinical team and the local context of care. … One name may appear on your bill, but the care is team-based.”However, Singh said his research on misdiagnoses shows that doctors in general need to do a better job listening to patients.Jha said he’d like the health system to learn what women doctors are doing right when they treat other women, then teach all physicians to practice that way.“We should train everyone to be better at generating trust and being worthy of trust,” Jha said.Wyatt said the country needs to take several steps to better care for women patients, including “de-biasing training” to teach doctors to overcome stereotypes. The health care system also needs to increase the number of women physicians in leadership, recruit more female doctors and do a better job at retaining them. All physicians also need more understanding of how adverse childhood experiences affect patient health, particularly for women, he said.“More than once I’ve had white female patients tell me they came to be because I listened and they trusted me,” Wyatt said.",2024-04-23 00:09:00 AM EEST,NBC,"Women are less likely to die when treated by female doctors, study suggests",https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/women-are-less-likely-die-treated-female-doctors-study-suggests-rcna148254
Daysia Tolentino,"Raquel Lee Bolleau, who shared her experiences working on “The Amanda Show” as a child actor in “Quiet on Set,” said she is “done” with the entertainment industry after her recent experience with the docuseries.In a TikTok video posted Wednesday, Bolleau expressed her frustration with  the Investigation Discovery series , which featured interviews with several actors and former child stars who alleged abuse, inappropriate behavior and a toxic work environment when they appeared on some Nickelodeon shows Dan Schneider produced in the 2000s and the 2010s. Following the docuseries' release last month, Schneider  apologized  for some of his past behavior and the on-set atmosphere.Bolleau said the “Quiet on Set” producers did not invite her to join a panel discussion with other former Nickelodeon stars for the show’s fifth episode, which aired Sunday. Representatives for Bolleau and Investigation Discovery did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Maxine Productions, which produced “Quiet on Set,” and its parent company, Sony Pictures Entertainment, also did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The “Quiet on Set” producers “did the same thing that the industry always does,” Bolleau says in the video, which had amassed over 300,000 views as of Thursday afternoon. “They get what they want from you and then they’re done.”Journalist Soledad O’Brien interviewed the actors who appeared in the episode. She asked them about various issues that were brought up in the docuseries, as well as their thoughts about what the entertainment industry can improve on.  While Bolleau was not part of the group that was interviewed, the final episode included a previously unaired clip of her  describing an alleged incident  on set of “The Amanda Show."" She said she was ""infuriated"" after she was repeatedly spit on by Amanda Bynes during a sketch. She said she was told to ""keep your cool"" and try not to make the incident a problem.A spokesperson for Bynes declined to comment on Thursday.O’Brien showed the clip of Bolleau to “All That” actor Bryan Hearne and his mother, Tracey Brown, during a discussion about racism and representation on set. Hearne said that he was unaware of the incident Bolleau recounted and that he had had only “one solid conversation” with her. However, he said, hearing Bolleau’s experience “hit me really hard.” His mother, Brown, called the incident ""racist.""In his response to the docuseries’ release, Schneider said that “diversity has always been very important” to him.Hearne and Brown did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Bolleau said producers informed her that the clip of her would be shown Sunday, the day the episode dropped. She said she wished she had been able to be part of the discussion with others.“You want me to share my story, but you don’t want to involve me in the actual narrative of change,” Bolleau said. She also claimed that the documentary’s producers did not tell her the premise of the series when they reached out to her. “First of all, you don’t even tell me what type of documentary that I’m going to be a part of,” she said. “You never questioned whether or not this is going to be triggering for me.”It has been “very, very difficult” for Bolleau to face the traumatic experiences that happened to her when she was a young actor, she said. “I can’t do it anymore,” she said at the end of the TikTok video. “I’ve given it all I can. I don’t have nothing else. The show, I don’t want to talk about it. I’m going to get back to my family, my businesses; that’s what I’m focused on. Because this industry? Y’all can have it.”  She posted the video days after former “Double Dare” host Marc Summers also said  he was misled  about the docuseries’ premise. Summers  appeared on Elvis Duran’s program “The Elvis Duran Show”  to promote his off-Broadway show “The Life and Slimes of Marc Summers,” which tells his life story, including his time at Nickelodeon.In the interview, Summers said the docuseries producers “did a bait and switch” on him. “They ambushed me,” he said. “They never told me what this documentary was really about.”Summers said he left the “Quiet on Set” interview after producers showed him a video and explained the premise of the series. It was not clear from the interview or from the docuseries what clip he was shown.Mary Robertson and Emma Schwartz, who directed the series, previously responded to Summers' comments in a joint statement provided by Investigation Discovery. “We are clear with each participant about the nature of our projects,"" they said.",2024-04-12 01:42:00 AM EEST,NBC,Former Nickelodeon star featured in 'Quiet on Set' says she's 'done' with the entertainment industry,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/raquel-lee-bolleau-quiet-on-set-docuseries-response-rcna147404
"Caroline Kee, TODAY","In early April, a  dairy worker in Texas  tested positive for avian influenza, also known as bird flu, amid a multi-state outbreak of the virus among cows. The bird flu virus has also been detected in raw milk, but authorities say the current risk to the public is low.It’s the first time this strain of bird flu —  referred to as highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1 ) — has been detected in cattle and the first documented cow-to-human transmission of an avian influenza virus,  according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The person in Texas is only the second case of bird flu in a human ever reported in the United States.While there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, health officials are on high alert.In a  recent press conference , a leading expert at the World Health Organization called the risk of the bird flu spreading to humans “an enormous concern.” Speaking to reporters on April 18, WHO chief scientist Dr. Jeremy Farrar warned that bird flu viruses are increasingly infecting mammals.“The great concern ... is that the virus evolves and develops the ability to infect humans and then critically, the ability to go from human-to-human transmission,” Farrar said.<h2>Is bird flu a problem now?</h2>The current bird flu outbreak is affecting cows in over a dozen dairy farms across the country. Although the risk to humans is considered low, health officials are calling for increased monitoring of infected animals and people exposed to them.While the thought of “bird flu” may sound alarming and stoke Covid-19 pandemic fears, influenza among birds is not new.“The current bird flu strain that we’re concerned with, H5N1, has actually been circulating around the world for quite some time,” said Dr. William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.H5N1 is widespread among wild birds and is causing an ongoing outbreak among poultry in the U.S., according to the CDC.<h2>What is bird flu?</h2>Bird flu is a disease caused by infection with avian influenza type A viruses.  Avian influenza A viruses  occur naturally among wild aquatic birds, such as geese, ducks and swans, Schaffner said, but they can also circulate among domestic poultry.“Bird flu viruses occasionally get into other mammalian species (like pigs). We’ve all heard of swine flu,” Schaffner said. Avian influenza A viruses can also infect horses, bats and dogs,  per the CDC  — rarely, they spread to humans.“More recently, we have seen an increase of infections in cattle,” said Dr. Hilary M. Babcock, infectious disease specialist at Washington University of St. Louis and BJC Healthcare.This is the first time the avian influenza strain of highly pathogenic H5N1, which causes severe and often fatal disease in birds, has been found in cows. “That’s pretty unusual,” said Schaffner. However, this H5N1 strain does not seem to be making cows very sick, he added.<h2>What states have bird flu?</h2>Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (which include the strain of H5N1 that’s currently spreading) have been detected in the U.S. in wild aquatic birds, commercial poultry and backyard bird flocks beginning in January 2022, according to the CDC.Overall,  48 states  have reported cases of highly pathogenic H5N1.The current outbreak of H5N1 affecting cows has spread to eight states so far, per  the U.S. Department of Agriculture . As of April 11, cases have been reported among dairy herds in:Currently, only one human in Texas is known to have contracted H5N1 in this outbreak, experts say.There have been only two human cases of H5N1 in the U.S. ever, said Babcock — the first case was detected  in Colorado in 2022  in a person who had direct contact with infected poultry.As H5N1 surveillance increases, experts anticipate the number of cases among cows to increase. “We’re looking harder now and finding more cases (among cattle) that even 10 years ago would have gone undetected,” Schaffner said.The risk to the general public in the U.S. is low, experts say. For people exposed due to their line of work, the risk is considered “low-to-moderate,” the  World Health Organization said in a statement .<h2>How does the bird flu spread to humans?</h2>“Every once in a while, a bird flu virus can get into a human, but that’s rare,” Schaffner said. Avian influenza viruses can spread from infected birds to humans in a few ways,  according to the CDC :Infected birds can shed the virus in their saliva, nasal secretions, mucus and feces. People can become infected when a large enough amount of the virus gets into the mouth, nose, eyes or is inhaled, Schaffner said.Transmission to humans typically occurs through close contact with infected birds without protective gear. It can also occur if a person touches contaminated surfaces and puts their hands in their eyes or mouth or if they breathe in droplets from the air, per the CDC.It was not immediately clear how the dairy cow infected the person in Texas, experts note. The only other person who contracted H5N1 in the U.S. was directly involved in the culling of birds presumed to be infected with H5N1, said Babcock.Sporadic cases of H5N1 in humans have been reported around the world, often in rural areas where people live closely with poultry or other birds. According to the  WHO , since 2003 there have been 889 cases and 463 deaths caused by H5N1 in 23 countries.Once the bird flu gets into a human, “it is almost never spread to anyone else,” said Schaffner. However, “there are ultra-rare instances of transmission from a person very sick with bird flu to a family member or caregiver.”No human-to-human spread has occurred with the contemporary H5N1 viruses currently spreading in birds,  the CDC said .When this does happen, it does not lead to continued spread between people “because the virus doesn’t have the (genetic) capacity to spread easily from person to person,” Schaffner said.“This strain of bird flu has been around for about a decade and it still has not picked up this capacity to spread readily from person to person, thankfully. ... That should be a matter of reassurance, but also keep us in public health on alert,” said Schaffner.<h2>Can you get bird flu through eggs?</h2>There is no evidence that people can get bird flu from food that’s been properly prepared and cooked, and it is safe to eat eggs, chicken and beef, and drink pasteurized milk, experts say.“We have not seen cases that have been from ingesting animal products or animals that may have been infected,” said Babcock.The infected dairy cow herds that have been detected are in quarantine and their milk is being destroyed, Schaffner said.In a statement , the USDA said the commercial milk supply in the U.S. remains safe.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said  it does not currently have concerns about the safety of pasteurized milk products, including pasteurized cheese.“The pasteurization process in the U.S. keeps our milk supply very safe,” Babcock said. Pasteurization heats the milk to a high enough temperature to kill bacteria and viruses, including influenza.Drinking unpasteurized or “raw” milk, which is increasingly trendy, is associated with various infectious disease hazards, Schaffner said. “I discourage people from drinking raw milk,” he added.The risk of humans becoming  infected by eating eggs  from poultry with H5N1 is low,  the FDA  says, and there are safeguards in place to identify infected poultry and remove their eggs from the market.It’s possible for products from infected animals to end up in the food supply, said Babcock, but the risk to humans is still very low. Properly storing and cooking food further reduces that risk.Although beef cattle are not involved in this outbreak, Schaffner recommends cooking beef to a safe internal temperature. The  FDA recommends  cooking eggs until the white and yolk are firm.“There are other reasons that you shouldn’t eat raw eggs (or meat), because these can carry lots of different pathogens,” Babcock said.<h2>What happens if a human gets the bird flu?</h2>Bird flu infections in humans can range in severity, experts note. Some people have zero or only mild symptoms, while others develop severe disease, according to  the CDC . “It can be a serious infection with a high mortality rate,” Schaffner said.The Texas patient had a mild infection, with eye redness as the only symptom,  the CDC said . “It was not even a respiratory infection. It was ... conjunctivitis or pink eye,” Schaffner noted.The patient was treated with flu antivirals and is recovering. “We have antiviral medications, the same ones we use to treat regular flu, that work against this avian influenza strain,” Schaffner said.The other human case of H5N1 in the U.S. in 2022 was a mild infection as well, Babcock added.<h2>Symptoms of bird flu in humans</h2>According to the CDC  and experts, the reported signs and symptoms of avian influenza in humans include:Bird flu in humans may look similar to a regular flu or upper respiratory infection, said Babcock, or a person may have no obvious symptoms. It can also lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure and other complications. “There’s a full range,” she added.There is no way to diagnose an infection with bird flu by symptoms alone, the CDC says. Laboratory testing is required.<h2>Can you recover from bird flu?</h2>Yes, you can recover from bird flu. The person recently infected in Texas was treated with flu antivirals and is recovering. The Colorado patient infected in 2022 also recovered.Globally, bird flu symptoms have ranged from mild to severe, resulting in death in some cases, according to the CDC.<h2>How to prevent spread of bird flu</h2>Although the risk of getting bird flu is low, the CDC recommends the following protective actions:",2024-04-23 06:59:00 AM EEST,NBC,"As bird flu spreads in the U.S., is it safe to eat eggs?

Erika Edwards,"Warnings about  fake Botox injections  given by people not trained to give the shots are growing. On Friday, the  New York City Health Department  said that three people have had to go to emergency departments after getting injections of botulinum toxin in their face, neck, upper back or armpits.Within days or weeks of getting the shots, the three developed a range of symptoms, from double vision and drooping eyelids to difficulty swallowing, breathing and raising their arms.Two were hospitalized, and one needed to be admitted to an intensive care unit.  The new insights come as both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration investigate other cases of people who’ve had to be hospitalized with potentially severe side effects after getting fake Botox shots from unlicensed providers.On Friday, the CDC reported that  at least 22 people in 11 states  have had bad reactions, including slurred speech, trouble breathing and blurry vision, after receiving counterfeit versions of the wrinkle-smoothing treatment. Eleven of those patients were hospitalized, the CDC said, and six were treated with No deaths have been reported. Of 20 people with information available, 11 (55%) people were hospitalized and 6 (27%) were treated with botulism antitoxin because of concerns that the botulinum toxin could have spread beyond the injection site. Of seven people tested for botulism, six people had negative results. Results are pending for one person.All reports came from people identifying as females, ranging in age from 25 to 59 years, with a median age of 41 years. Twenty (91%) people reported receiving botulinum toxin injections for cosmetic purposes. All people reported receiving these injections from unlicensed or untrained individuals or in non-healthcare settings, including homes and spas.All are women between the ages of 25 and 59, most around age 40. The women had received the shots in “non-healthcare settings,” such as homes and spas, the CDC said. Reports of symptoms possibly related to the fake Botox were first reported in early November 2023.“People should not be getting injections from friends or at parties,” NYC Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan said in a  press release  Friday. “A price that is too good to be true, or if a service provider does not explain the risks and side effects of the procedure, are clear warning signs that the products or services may not be legitimate and could pose a risk to your health.”The  FDA  said that there’s no indication that authentic Botox, from the drugmaker AbbVie, is linked to any of the illnesses.The drug uses a purified form of a neurotoxin called botulinum toxin that causes muscle paralysis. Injected in precise amounts into specific areas of the face, it can relax muscles that cause wrinkles.In an email to NBC News, the FDA said that it’s “actively working” with state and federal health authorities to investigate the source of counterfeit Botox.“The question is, is this ‘faux-tox’ all one and the same?” asked Dr. Adam Friedman, a dermatologist and chair of dermatology at George Washington University. “Or are multiple people creating different versions of it? We don’t know the answer to that.”Dr. Kate Dee, a physician and founder of Glow Medispa in Seattle, blamed the recent illnesses on  unregulated medical spas , which have ballooned in recent years, becoming a  $15 billion  wellness industry. “The problem is not that there’s fake Botox around and doctors might accidentally use it. That’s not what’s happening. Doctors get real Botox, and we pay lots of money to do things legally and legitimately,” she said. “It’s these people who are busy trying to make money from the med spa industry, the esthetics industry, who are getting it because it’s so much cheaper.”Cases linked to counterfeit Botox have been detected so far in California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. At least 11 patients have been hospitalized, according to the CDC.Some symptoms, such as blurred vision and drooping eyelids, appeared near the injection site, while others were more widespread, including fatigue and generalized weakness.Other potentially concerning symptoms could include constipation, incontinence, dry mouth and difficulty lifting the head, the FDA said.The difference in side effects from fake BotoxUsually, adverse events related to real Botox injections are the result of “poor technique,” such as injecting the toxin into the wrong muscle or in the wrong location, Friedman said.“But if these patients might be going into respiratory distress or failure because of systemic poisoning,” he said, “that’s different from what doctors usually see.”The FDA said there are several ways to identify counterfeit Botox products:Dee recommends that patients ask to see the vial of toxin before getting the shots. “At the very least, look at the vial because if it’s in any other language besides English, it’s not real Botox.”",2024-04-19 23:45:00 PM EEST,NBC,"Where is the 'faux-tox' coming from?

The Associated Press,"The Sheetz convenience store chain has been hit with a lawsuit by federal officials who allege the company discriminated against minority job applicants.Sheetz Inc., which operates more than 700 stores in six states, discriminated against Black, Native American and multiracial job seekers by automatically weeding out applicants whom the company deemed to have failed a criminal background check, according to U.S. officials.President Joe Biden stopped by a Sheetz for snacks this week while campaigning in Pennsylvania.The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed suit in Baltimore against Altoona, Pennsylvania-based Sheetz and two subsidary companies, alleging the chain’s longstanding hiring practices have a disproportionate impact on minority applicants and thus run afoul of federal civil rights law.Sheetz said Thursday that it “does not tolerate discrimination of any kind.”“Diversity and inclusion are essential parts of who we are. We take these allegations seriously. We have attempted to work with the EEOC for nearly eight years to find common ground and resolve this dispute,” company spokesperson Nick Ruffner said in a statement.The privately held, family-run company has more than 23,000 employees and operates convenience stores and gas stations in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, Ohio and North Carolina.The lawsuit was filed in federal court on Wednesday, the day Biden stopped at a Sheetz market on  a western Pennsylvania campaign swing , buying snacks, posing for photos and chatting up patrons and employees.Federal officials said they do not allege Sheetz was motivated by racial animus, but take issue with the way the chain uses criminal background checks to screen job seekers. The company was sued under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits workplace discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion and national origin.“Federal law mandates that employment practices causing a disparate impact because of race or other protected classifications must be shown by the employer to be necessary to ensure the safe and efficient performance of the particular jobs at issue,” EEOC attorney Debra M. Lawrence said in a statement.“Even when such necessity is proven, the practice remains unlawful if there is an alternative practice available that is comparably effective in achieving the employer’s goals but causes less discriminatory effect,” Lawrence said.It wasn’t immediately clear how many job applicants have been affected, but the agency said Sheetz’s unlawful hiring practices date to at least 2015.The EEOC, an independent agency that enforces federal laws against workplace discrimination, is seeking to force Sheetz to offer jobs to applicants who were unlawfully denied employment and to provide back pay, retroactive seniority and other benefits.The EEOC began its probe of the convenience store chain after two job applicants filed complaints alleging employment discrimination.The agency found that Black job applicants were deemed to have failed the company’s criminal history screening and were denied employment at a rate of 14.5%, while multiracial job seekers were turned away 13.5% of the time and Native Americans were denied at a rate of 13%.By contrast, fewer than 8% of white applicants were refused employment because of a failed criminal background check, the EEOC’s lawsuit said.The EEOC notified Sheetz in 2022 that it was likely violating civil rights law, but the agency said its efforts to mediate a settlement failed, prompting this week’s lawsuit.For more from NBC BLK,  sign up for our weekly newsletter .",2024-04-19 19:59:00 PM EEST,NBC,Convenience store chain with hundreds of outlets in 6 states hit with discrimination lawsuit,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/sheetz-convenience-store-chain-discrimination-lawsuit-eeoc-rcna148567
Kalhan Rosenblatt,"Some songs that Taylor Swift fans know ""All Too Well"" returned to TikTok on Thursday months after being removed.The artist's songs were among the many tracks pulled off of TikTok by Universal Music Group after the label and the platform  failed to reach an agreement  earlier this year.

The Associated Press,"MILWAUKEE — Indiana Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton said a fan directed a racial slur at his younger brother during Game 1 of an Eastern Conference first-round playoff series with the Milwaukee Bucks.“My little brother in the stands the other day was called an N-word,” Haliburton said after the Pacers’  125-108 Game 2 victory  over the Bucks on Tuesday night. “It was important for us as a family to just address that. That was important for us to talk about because that didn’t sit right with anybody in our family. It’s just been important to have my family here right now, and my little brother’s handled that the right way.”The Bucks were asked about Haliburton’s comments after Tuesday’s game.“An arena guest services representative reported that during Sunday’s game a few guests were not sitting in their correct seats,” a Bucks spokesman responded. “The guest services representative asked the group to move one section over to their correct seats. Then, one of the individuals in the group claimed to the representative that a person sitting in front of him had used a derogatory term toward him. The accused person denied the accusation. The group moved to their correct seats and no further incident was reported.“We take our fan environment extremely seriously and are committed to providing a safe and secure experience.”Haliburton was making his playoff debut in his home state.

Arturo Conde,"Fans will recognize him from the reboot of “Magnum P.I.,” a crime action TV series about a former Navy SEAL who solves cases in Hawaii. Starting Friday, actor Jay Hernandez can be seen on the big screen in  “The Long Game,”  an underdog sports movie about a Mexican American golf team who wins the Texas high school championship in 1957.In the film also starring Dennis Quaid and Cheech Marin, Hernandez plays J.B. Peña, a Mexican American war veteran and school district superintendent who's rejected from membership at the San Felipe Country Club in Del Rio, Texas, because of his ethnicity, but who goes on to form a high school golf team, the Mustangs, for the Mexican American teens who fell in love with the sport while caddying at the club.  The Mexican American golf team  went on to win the high school championship .“For my character particularly, he feels that's (the golf club) his destination of acceptance. ... It’s an aspirational thing for him,” Hernandez said in an interview. “He served in the military, that wasn’t enough. He’s essentially living the American dream, that’s still not enough,” Hernandez said about Peña. “He just feels like there’s this moving goal post.”“The Long Game,” directed by Julio Quintana and adapted from Humberto G. Garcia’s novel “Mustang Miracle,” tells the  true story of the five Mexican American golfers  from San Felipe High School who became state champions in spite of segregation. “Mexican Americans in the 1950s occupied no better stature in American society than did African Americans,” Garcia wrote in the book. “We were not allowed in many restaurants, hotels, and other service establishments. In fact, we were not even allowed to enter the many buildings we helped build. Mexican Americans were certainly not allowed to join country clubs and partake of the game of golf as members.”Hernandez, who's also one of the executive producers of “The Long Game,” said the story is important because it shows viewers that there are many types of Americans.""We’re American and the American story is also an immigrant story. It’s also a Mexican American story. It’s also a Puerto Rican story. It’s also a Chinese American story. That’s the beauty of this country,"" he said. Off camera, Hernandez, who was born in Los Angeles, says identity is something he is trying to understand.“I have obviously a natural affinity to the United States. I love this country. I grew up with my dad flying the American flag on our porch since I was a young kid,” he said.But, he added, part of his family’s cultural background — specifically on his father’s side — is also from Mexico. And this has shaped his roles in front of the camera.‘They don’t get the acknowledgment’  “I played cops and soldiers and done so many of those types of characters. My personal connection is that my grandfather served in World War II. And he was probably one of those people whose stories don’t really get told,” Hernandez said. “They don’t get the acknowledgment that they deserve in terms of Mexican Americans serving the armed forces.”Putting a spotlight on those overlooked stories motivated Hernandez to work on this movie.“It’s not always border stories and criminals. There’s a whole other world of stories that need to be told, be it astronauts, or golfers, or just people transcending their environment,” he said.Ultimately, Hernandez said, “The Long Game” is a story about trying to fit in.He described a scene from the movie where the young golfers go to Mexico. As Mexican Americans they’re not recognized there as full Mexicans. But in the U.S., they are not seen as full Americans either.""They’re not accepted as full people,"" Hernandez said. ""They’re the other in the story.""For more from NBC Latino,  sign up for our weekly newsletter .",2024-04-12 12:30:00 PM EEST,NBC,Racism kept these Mexican Americans from a Texas golf club.

Associated Press,"The medical records of women will be shielded from criminal investigations if they cross state lines to seek an  abortion  where it is legal, under a new rule that the Biden administration finalized Monday.The regulation, which is intended to protect women who live in states  where abortion is illegal  from prosecution, is almost certain to face legal challenges from anti-abortion advocates and criticism from abortion-rights advocates that it does not go far enough.“No one should have their medical records used against them, their doctor or their loved one just because they sought or received lawful reproductive health care,” Jennifer Klein, the director of the White House Gender Policy Council, told reporters on Monday.The new regulation is an update to the  Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act  of 1996, which prohibits medical providers and health insurers from divulging medical information about patients. Typically, however, law enforcement can access those records for investigations.In states with strict abortion rules, the federal regulation would essentially prohibit state or local officials from gathering medical records related to reproductive health care for a civil, criminal or administrative investigation from providers or health insurers in a state where abortion remains legal.In theory, it would provide the most cover to women who leave states with strict bans to seek an abortion from a medical provider in a state that allows it.“As someone who does see patients who travel from all across the country at our health center in D.C., it’s a reality. I’ve had patients ask ... are there going to be consequences for me when I go home?” said Dr. Serina Floyd, an OB-GYN who provides abortions in Washington.Women who also seek fertility, contraception or miscarriage care will also be protected, the nation’s top health official  Xavier Becerra  said Monday.A group of  19 Republican Attorneys General, all from states with strict abortion laws,  urged the Health and Human Services agency to ditch the rule when a draft was released last year. The regulation “would unlawfully interfere with states' authority to enforce their laws, and does not serve any legitimate need,” they wrote in a letter to HHS last year.“Relying as it does on a false view of state regulation of abortion, the proposed rule is a solution in search of a problem,” the letter said.But the new regulation does not go as far as protecting women from criminal investigations when they order abortion pills online,  as has become increasingly common . For example, it would not safeguard medical records of a patient who orders an abortion pill while at her home in a state like Mississippi, where abortion is mostly banned, from a provider in Illinois, where abortion is legal.The rule also does not require law enforcement officials to obtain a warrant for any medical records of patients,  a rule change some Democrats had sought from the administration . Instead, law enforcement can seek a subpoena, court order or an administrative request to obtain medical records.Becerra acknowledged to reporters that the regulation has limitations — and may be challenged legally.“Until we have a national law that reinstitutes Roe v. Wade, we’re going to have issues,” Becerra said. “But that doesn’t stop us from doing everything we can to protect every Americans’ right to access the care they need.”At least 22 Democratic-controlled states have laws or executive orders that seek to protect medical providers or patients who participate in abortion from investigations by law enforcement in states with bans. Medical providers in some of those states are prescribing abortion pills via telehealth to women in states with abortion bans.It’s not clear that public officials have sought those medical records of patients around abortion. But last year,  Texas officials demanded records  from at least two out-of-state health centers that provide gender-affirming care. Texas, like most other Republican-controlled states, has a ban on gender-affirming care for minors.",2024-04-23 16:45:00 PM EEST,NBC,Biden administration tightens rules for obtaining medical records related to abortion,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/abortion-related-medical-records-protected-rcna148946
Kalhan Rosenblatt,"The first weekend of the iconic Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California, has concluded — but social media is still buzzing about all the event’s highs and lows. From a much-hyped No Doubt reunion to Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce sightings, the influencer-filled festival was full of moments that made headlines.Here’s what you might have missed.No Doubt reunites with a surprise guestIt's been  roughly  nine  years  since the members of No Doubt, led by Gwen Stefani, performed together. But the quartet reunited in the  desert for an electric, nostalgic set.“I didn’t think this was really going to happen,” Stefani told the crowd at one point, according to social media footage posted by users. “Did you?”During the song “Bathwater,” singer Olivia Rodrigo surprised the crowd by joining the band onstage.Blur was a bustDamon Albarn, best known for his band Gorillaz, performed at Coachella with his band Blur — but was met with a lukewarm reception, according to reports and social media footage from the event. Some songs, in which Albarn attempted to get the crowd to sing along, were met with silence from the audience. At one point Albarn told the crowd that they should sing along because “you’ll never see us again.”Swift and Kelce  dance  in the desert Typically, Swift is singing on the world’s biggest stage while her boyfriend, Kelce, is on the field playing for the Kansas City Chiefs. But at Coachella, the couple were spotted  in the crowd , singing along and dancing as they watched the set for Bleachers, the band of Swift’s frequent collaborator Jack Antonoff. They were also seen enjoying a performance from rapper Ice Spice, whom Swift featured on her song “Karma.”Fans shared pictures of them all weekend on social media.Grimes apologizes for a disastrous setDuring her set, Grimes experienced significant technical malfunctions. While the first part of her set appeared to go as planned, the second half was riddled with issues, eventually leading Grimes to scream into the microphone in frustration. She later posted on X , apologizing for the mishap and saying that her set for weekend two will be “flawless.”Kesha changes the lyrics of 'TiK ToK'Kesha made a guest appearance during Reneé Rapp’s set. While the pair performed Kesha’s “TiK ToK,” the singer changed the opening lyrics from “Wake up in the morning feeling like P. Diddy” to “Wake up in the morning like, ‘F--- P. Diddy.’” Both Rapp and Kesha held up their middle fingers during the line. Since November,  Sean “Diddy” Combs  has been hit with five lawsuits in New York accusing him of sexual assault, sexual trafficking and engaging in other criminal activity. Combs has denied all of the allegations, calling them sickening.Coach-EARLE-aIt wouldn’t be Coachella without influencers abound.The soda brand Poppi leaned in by tapping the TikTok “It Girl” Alix Earle.

"Marlene Lenthang,Jay Blackman","Officials are investigating a video that showed  a Colorado Rockies coach  sitting in the cockpit during a team flight— a major security violation. The incident unfolded on a charter flight operated by United Airlines on April 10 from Denver to Toronto, the  Wall Street Journal  reported. Team hitting coach Hensley Meulens posted the clip on his Instagram, which was later deleted after it circulated online. In the clip, Meulens is seen sitting behind the controls in the captain’s seat in the cockpit. He gives the camera a thumbs up and the person filming pans to a uniformed United flight officer in the co-pilot seat. He said, “I’m going to land the plane tonight,” as he points to some of the flight controls and mimics the pushing the plane’s yoke. The FAA said it was investigating the incident, noting that federal regulations restrict access to the flight deck to specific individuals. United said it was “deeply disturbed by what we see in that video, which appears to show an unauthorized person in the flight deck at cruise altitude while the autopilot was engaged.”“As a clear violation of our safety and operational policies, we’ve reported the incident to the FAA and have withheld the pilots from service while we conduct an investigation” the airline said. NBC News has reached out other the Colorado Rockies and Meulens for comment, but did not immediately hear back Friday. ",2024-04-19 23:34:00 PM EEST,NBC,Video of a Colorado Rockies coach sitting in cockpit during team flight prompts FAA probe,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/video-colorado-rockies-coach-sitting-cockpit-team-flight-prompts-faa-p-rcna148554
"Sahil Kapur,Owen Hayes","WASHINGTON — Thousands of fans lined up along Pennsylvania Avenue on Saturday for the thrill of  watching a Formula 1  race winner blast down the iconic street in a championship-winning car.The event was hosted on a breezy spring afternoon by reigning F1 champions Oracle   Red Bull Racing as part of a series of events in American cities designed to bring the world’s fastest race cars closer to the  sport’s fastest - growing fan   base .The main event featured F1 race winner and former Red Bull driver David Coulthard. Coulthard, a retired driver who goes by “DC,” raced the RB7 car  —  in which Sebastian Vettel won the 2011 title  —  down the street between the Capitol and the White House, the same area that gets blocked off for presidential inaugurations. Crowds packed the spectator zones for a good view, cheering and smelling burned rubber as Coulthard hit the throttle in a car that goes over 200 mph, some of them covering their ears as the engine revved up. “It’s exciting!” said Ron Binkauskas, who flew to Washington from Kentucky and watched in the VIP zone. “You don’t realize from TV just how fast these cars are and how loud they are.”Coulthard told NBC News that he was most excited to drive alongside “the iconic images” of Washington and that he would “love” to see an F1 street race in the nation’s capital.“For many years, Formula 1 under its previous management tried to sort of find a foothold in America to have a true world championship. America is such an important and powerful country,” Coulthard said. “The American owners, Liberty [Media], have understood very well the American market ... and they’ve opened it up and made the paddock more accessible. I think, previously, the sport was quite sort of elitist and had the barriers up. And it was very difficult for people to connect. But that has really changed, and the audience has just gone [up].”James Smith, who lives in Washington, took some time off work to see the show — and to see an F1 car in person for the first time.“I’m just a fan of the Red Bull team, and it’s not every day that they come to this part of town. So it’s something I want to see,” he said.Smith got into F1 by watching ""Drive to Survive"" on Netflix. ""I watched it during Covid a lot with some of my friends,"" he said. ""And Red Bull was really heavily featured. So that’s how I got into the team.”“Drive to Survive,” the popular documentary that premiered in 2019, is widely credited, including by F1 drivers and team bosses, for fueling the sport’s growth and bringing in more American fans.But this year is a crucial time for the sport in the U.S., a test of whether it can keep growing — or even sustain its new fans.From 2018 to 2023,  ESPN s ays , viewership doubled from 554,000 to 1.11 million per race. But last year, it ticked down slightly from its peak of 1.21 million in 2022, which the network attributed in part to the record-smashing inaugural Miami Grand Prix that year.One of the goals of the sport is to make it more accessible.Red Bull’s two-day event included a zone nearby Friday and Saturday for fans to test out the Red Bull “simulators,” which the drivers use to hone their craft, to practice pit stops by changing tires the way the professionals do at races and to buy merch. Along with Red Bull race suits, plenty of fans were decked out in gear of other F1 teams — most notably Ferrari and McLaren.They included Corey Jean Gartenhaus, of Washington, whose favorite driver is Lando Norris of McLaren.“I actually had a calendar invite on my calendar today blocked off, and it said that I’m going to F1 DC. And my boss was like, that’s really awesome,” she said. “You watch it on TV and to feel it in real life and feel the vibrations of the engine and everything like that, it’s just a very different experience.”The event brought out old and new Formula 1 fans, too.“I am one of the biggest Formula 1 and racing fans, and this is one of the biggest events that we’ve had in the District,” said Charles Kurtis, who has worked at go-kart tracks in the Washington area.Sebastian Fleischer, a racing driver and motorsports fan in Maryland, said he has been a Formula 1 fan “forever” — at least since Michael Schumacher was dominating in a Ferrari two decades ago.“It’s really great to see how much growth and how big the sport has gotten in the United States, having three Grand Prix now,” he said, referring to the races in Miami; Austin, Texas; and Las Vegas — more than any other country hosts.Kiani Parvizi, a self-described “Ferrari girl” who is a fan of Charles Leclerc, said she brought her roommate to the event because “I wanted to show my roommate what the F1 world was like and hopefully get her to watch a couple races.”The showrun took place the day Red Bull’s defending F1 champion, Max Verstappen, scored the team’s 100th pole position ahead of the Chinese Grand Prix. Verstappen is dominating the sport, having won a record 19 of 22 races last year and three of the first four races this year. Although longtime F1 fans have learned to love the sport through eras of dominance — which never last — many newer fans have not. They want to see competition.Coulthard said he takes “the view that sport is about being the best” and that periods of dominance are inevitable when one team gets it right. But he said Americans have plenty of reasons to love F1.“This represents the very best and technology,” Coulthard said. “And if we look at the world we live in today, most people have a mobile phone or a laptop, and of course you want the latest and greatest because it just enhances your performance experience. What you have in Formula 1 is the fastest, most technologically advanced racing car series in the world.”",2024-04-21 04:06:00 AM EEST,NBC,Red Bull Formula 1 team turns Washington's iconic Pennsylvania Ave into a racetrack,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/red-bull-formula-1-dc-pennsylvania-ave-race-rcna148446
Associated Press,"SYDNEY — The world’s top anti-doping regulator says 23 Chinese swimmers were cleared to compete at the Tokyo Olympics despite testing positive for a banned heart medication because it agreed with Chinese authorities and ruled that their samples had been contaminated.The World Anti-Doping Agency said Saturday that the swimmers tested positive for the heart medication trimetazidine in the months leading up to the start of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 but that Chinese authorities told the agency the positives were the result of contamination.“Ultimately, we concluded that there was no concrete basis to challenge the asserted contamination,” WADA’s senior director of science and medicine Olivier Rabin said in a news release.The 30-member Chinese swim team won six medals in Tokyo, including three golds. Many of the athletes still compete for China and are expected to swim at the Paris Olympics this summer.Reports about the doping positives came out Saturday in the Daily Telegraph in Sydney and The New York Times.WADA responded to what it called “some misleading and potentially defamatory media coverage this week” and explained the process it undertook upon learning about the positive tests.The global drug-fighting organization said it also had been given a tip by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency as early as 2020 — before this case arose — about allegations of doping cover-ups in China but that USADA never followed up with evidence.USADA CEO Travis Tygart called the news of the Chinese positive tests “crushing.”“It’s even more devastating to learn the World Anti-Doping Agency and the Chinese Anti-Doping Agency secretly, until now, swept these positives under the carpet by failing to fairly and evenly follow the global rules that apply to everyone else in the world,” Tygart said.World Aquatics, which oversees global swimming, told the Daily Telegraph it was confident “that these (adverse analytical findings) were handled diligently and professionally, and in accordance with all applicable anti-doping regulations, including the World Anti-Doping Code.”The drug at the center of this case was also the medication that led to the suspension of  Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva  at the Winter Olympics in Beijing in 2022.In that case, WADA moved quickly to sanction Valieva upon learning about her positive test.The case underscores what many view as a flaw in the global anti-doping system — that a country’s own anti-doping organization is often the first line of defense in catching drug cheats and those organizations have different levels of motivation to fulfill that role.",2024-04-21 10:57:00 AM EEST,NBC,Chinese swimmers won Olympic medals despite failed doping tests,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/chinese-swimmers-olympics-failed-doping-tests-rcna148701
The Associated Press,"Roman Gabriel had big size and a big arm when he was the No. 2 draft pick of the Los Angeles Rams in 1962. Even while playing in an era of grinding it out on the ground, he still holds the  Rams’ team record with 154 touchdown passes .Gabriel, the first Filipino American quarterback in the NFL and the league MVP in 1969, died Saturday. He was 83.His son Roman Gabriel III  announced his father’s death  on social media, saying he died peacefully at home of natural causes.In 2021, the elder Gabriel told the Los Angeles Times, “I am retired with heart problems and arthritis but happy.” He said he split time between Wilmington, North Carolina, and Little River, South Carolina.“We mourn the loss of Rams legend and football pioneer, Roman Gabriel,”  the Rams said on X , formerly known as Twitter.Gabriel, who played at North Carolina State and was a two-time player of the year in the Atlantic Coast Conference, was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1989.He was 6-foot-5 and 235 pounds, big for a quarterback in that era. Green Bay coach Vince Lombardi once described him as “a big telephone pole,” according to the Los Angeles Times.Gabriel played 11 years for the Rams and five years with the Philadelphia Eagles, where he was traded after the Rams acquired John Hadl.“Gabe was an amazing player and an even better mentor. Words can’t explain my thanks for what a great teammate he was,” retired quarterback  Ron Jaworski , whom Gabriel backed up on the Eagles in his final season, posted on X. “A special player and a better man!”Gabriel was such a hot prospect that the Rams made him the No. 2 pick in the NFL draft, and the Oakland Raiders of the rival AFL selected him No. 1. Gabriel wound up signing with the Rams, though it took until George Allen was hired as coach in 1966 for Gabriel to start leaving a mark.From 1967 to 1970, Gabriel led the Rams to a 41-14-4 record and two division titles, though never a playoff game. He was voted MVP in 1969 after throwing for 2,549 yards with 24 touchdown passes and five rushing scores.Allen left for Washington after the 1970, and Gabriel was shipped to the Eagles in 1973. He was the NFL comeback player of the year, leading the league with 23 touchdown passes and 3,219 yards, as he tried to help revive the Eagles’ offense.After retiring, Gabriel worked briefly for CBS, calling NFL games.He went into coaching, with stints at Cal Poly Pomona, the Boston Breakers of the USFL and Raleigh-Durham in the World League of American Football.Gabriel also dabbled in acting. His movie credits included “Skidoo” starring Jackie Gleason in 1968, and 1969’s “The Undefeated” starring John Wayne and Rock Hudson. He appeared in such TV shows as “Gilligan’s Island,” “Perry Mason,” “Ironside” and “Wonder Woman.” He also joined Bob Hope on a USO tour of Vietnam.",2024-04-22 00:12:00 AM EEST,NBC,Roman Gabriel dies at 83.

"Sahil Kapur,Ryan Nobles,Frank Thorp V","WASHINGTON — Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday celebrated the  impending passage of $60 billion in U.S. aid to Ukraine  ahead of a final vote, while lamenting the fact that it took months to secure enough Republican support to land it.At a press conference, the Kentucky Republican pinpointed two men responsible for that delay: former Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson and former President Donald Trump.“The demonization of Ukraine began by Tucker Carlson, who in my opinion ended up where he should have been all along, which is  interviewing Vladimir Putin ,” McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters. “And so he had an enormous audience, which convinced a lot of rank and file Republicans that maybe this was a mistake.”“I think the former president had sort of mixed views on” Ukraine aid, he added, before alluding to the failed attempt to add border security provisions to the bill, “which requires you to deal with Democrats, and then a number of our members  thought it wasn’t good enough .”“And then our nominee for president didn’t seem to want us to do anything at all,” McConnell said. “That took months to work our way through it.”The top Senate Republican has been an ardent supporter of Ukraine aid and battled a slew of conservative voices who have sought to block it. He called the expected passage of the bill “an important day for America, and a very important day of freedom-loving countries around the world.”The Senate voted 80-19 on Tuesday to advance the legislation, setting up a final passage vote that’s expected later in the day, or could slip to Wednesday. President Joe Biden has vowed to sign it, and it could become law within days.McConnell, who consistently bucked loud conservative voices in his party who opposed Ukraine funding, argued that the margin of support for the war-torn country is an indication the Republican Party is tracking back to its Reaganesque roots of defending the encroachment on democracy around the world.McConnell said he remains committed to working to help regain a Republican Senate majority, despite his plans to step back from leadership at the end of the year. He said he believes the crop of candidates the Republicans have recruited are more inclined to back away from the party's recent isolationist tendencies.“I think we’ve turned the corner on the isolationist movement,” McConnell said. “I’ve noticed how uncomfortable proponents of that are when you call them isolationist. So I think we’ve made some progress and I think it’s gonna have to continue because we got big, big problems: China, Russia, Iran. Going into World War II we just had Germany and Japan.”The package’s difficulty in the House led to an extended period where Ukraine went without aid, primarily because of right-wing House Republicans who argued the money should not be spent abroad but instead should be spent here at home on border security. McConnell said part of the blame falls on the Biden administration for not recognizing the need earlier and reacting, but acknowledged Congress should’ve acted more quickly. “Acting quicker, partially because of the administration partially because of Congress, not approving this bill sooner, has not been helpful,” McConnell said.The Kentucky Republican also defended House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., whose transformation from Ukraine aid skeptic to staunch supporter helped assure passage in the House. “More important than what I think about the speaker is what the former president thinks about the speaker,” McConnell said. “And he obviously  made it clear that he was a fan of Speaker Johnson  and suggested some of his critics to shut up. So I’ll just quote the former president.”McConnell said he feels positive about the GOP’s Senate nominees so far in the battle for the majority this fall, when asked if he has the same “candidate quality” concerns of 2022.“I feel pretty good about our nominees. I’m pretty confident we’re going to win West Virginia. That’s 50. You all can do the math. One more makes 51,” McConnell said. “And I hope to hand this job over to the majority leader.”",2024-04-23 23:33:00 PM EEST,NBC,Mitch McConnell says Tucker Carlson and Trump's waffling delayed crucial Ukraine aid,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/mcconnell-says-tucker-carlson-trumps-waffling-delayed-crucial-ukraine-rcna149057

Tuesday’s primaries in Pennsylvania kick off the next round of intraparty battles this election cycle between GOP lawmakers and challengers who argue those lawmakers are insufficiently conservative. In Pennsylvania’s 1st District, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick is looking to defeat anti-abortion activist Mark Houck in the GOP primary. Primary fights are nothing new for Fitzpatrick, who has fended off challengers from the right since he was elected in 2016.Do you have a news tip?  Let us know Fitzpatrick, a former FBI agent, has built a bipartisan brand that has helped him hold on to a seat in a competitive district in the Philadelphia suburbs that President Joe Biden carried in 2020. But this year, Fitzpatrick and allied outside groups have hit the airwaves to take on Houck, in a sign that they view him as a greater threat than Fitzpatrick has faced in the past.  Two other moderate House Republicans — Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska, who also represents a district Biden won, and Tony Gonzales of Texas — will confront their primary challengers next month. Outside groups have also engaged in these races, with the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with House leadership and its nonprofit arm American Action Network boosting all three Republicans.  In Bacon’s competitive 2nd District, the four-term congressman is facing businessman Dan Frei in the state’s May 14 primary. Frei has some grassroots support and won the Nebraska Republican Party’s endorsement in January. (The state party  did not endorse any incumbents  this year, the Nebraska Examiner reported).  In the sprawling 23rd District in southwest Texas, which leans more Republican, Gonzales will face self-described “Second Amendment activist” Brandon Herrera, known for his YouTube channel, in a runoff primary election on May 28. Gonzales drew conservatives’ ire after he supported a bipartisan gun control measure following the 2022 mass school shooting in Uvalde, which is in his district. That vote earned him  a censure from the state GOP .  Even if Fitzpatrick, Bacon and Gonzalez prevail in their primaries, the early spending from their campaigns and allies is welcome news for Democrats, who would like to see these Republicans drain their campaign accounts ahead of tough fights in November. These incumbents have been elusive targets in the past for Democrats and could be tough to beat again this year — but first they have to win their primaries.  Read more about what to watch in tonight’s Pennsylvania’s primaries here →   Trump trial, Day 6: A witness details salacious stories and the judge bristles at gag order argumentsTestimony in Donald Trump’s historic hush money case  resumed on Tuesday , with prosecutors urging the court to hold the former president in contempt for attacking witnesses and others, and former tabloid impresario David Pecker returning to the stand with details that linked Trump’s circle to a slew of salacious stories.Here’s what happened on  Day 6 of Trump’s trial :Pecker returned to the stand:  Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, described giving directions to implement an agreement with Trump to help his 2016 campaign. Pecker said the Enquirer “embellished” stories about some of Trump’s opponents at Michael Cohen’s request,  including a piece  about Sen. Ted Cruz’s father being involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy.The publication had “mashed the photos” together of Lee Harvey Oswald and Cruz’s father, Pecker said, conceding that an article Trump cited repeatedly on the campaign trail was a fabrication.Merchan reserved judgment on the gag order:  An attorney for the district attorney’s office argued that Trump “seems to be angling” for incarceration by knowingly and repeatedly violating the gag order. Prosecutors had asked that Trump be held in contempt for attacking witnesses and others in the case, saying that they weren’t asking that he be imprisoned but want him fined for at least 10 violations. Trump lawyer Todd Blanche said that they are “trying to comply” with the gag order. “President Trump is being very careful,” he said.Judge Juan Merchan snapped: “You’re losing all credibility with the court.”Read more here →<h2>Why Republicans — not Democrats — should be hoping for high turnout this fall</h2>Even though he’s up by 2 points over Joe Biden, there’s a clear cautionary note for Donald Trump in  our latest NBC News poll : He’s relying on supporters who may not actually vote this November. Our pollsters were able to cross-check many (though not all) respondents with voter registration information. This allows them to see which respondents actually turn out to vote in elections, and how frequently they do so. And when this information was applied to the Biden-Trump race, some marked differences appeared:As you can see, Trump does best — by far — with people who didn’t vote in either the 2022 midterm election or the 2020 presidential election. And he edges out Biden among those who voted in 2020 but skipped the midterm. It’s only with those who participated in both elections that Trump lags Biden. For Trump, the good news here is that he’s shown in both the 2016 and 2020 elections an ability to bring out voters who aren’t otherwise that engaged politically: They’re for Trump when he’s on the ballot, but seemingly indifferent to Republican candidates in other elections. It’s a good bet that the vast majority of these types of voters will end up turning out this fall.And, of course, it’s true that presidential elections typically attract many people who don’t follow politics closely or who are voting for the first time. So if turnout this November approaches the record-shattering level of 2020, when nearly 160 million votes were cast, it would probably mean that most of those poll respondents who didn’t vote in either 2022 or 2020 are, in fact, turning out this time around — which would bode well for Trump.But this is where the cautionary note for Trump comes in. When asked about their level of interest in this year’s election, 64% indicated it was very high. That’s actually the lowest level our poll has found at roughly this point of a presidential campaign since we started asking the question in 2008.When it comes to forecasting potential turnout disparities between each party’s base, this can be a very imprecise indicator this far from November. (In fact, Trump is actually up by 2 points right now among those who say they have a very high level of interest.) But what this does underscore is the possibility that turnout will, in fact, be significantly lower this year than it was in 2020.And to see the trouble this could pose for Trump, just consider the consistently strong Democratic performances in  recent special elections  — most notably the party’s 8-point victory in the race to fill former New York GOP Rep. George Santos’ Long Island-based seat in February. That margin was bigger than many expected and spoke to  the intense motivation of a major segment  of the Democratic base: college-educated suburbanites.These voters have proven themselves determined to cast ballots against Trump and his party at every opportunity. In low-turnout affairs, like special elections, this fervor can be decisive. In an ultra-high turnout atmosphere, less so. So the more this November’s turnout level falls from 2020, the more influential these deeply committed voters figure to be. It adds up to an inversion of what previously has been the conventional wisdom: This time, it’s Trump and the Republicans who are hoping for high turnout.That’s all from The Politics Desk for now.

"Aria Bendix,Joe Murphy","This year's measles case total is now the highest of the last five years. The United States has  seen 125 cases  across 17 states as of Thursday — its largest annual tally since 2019, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.From January to March, the U.S. recorded  around 30% of the total cases seen since the beginning of 2020 , according to  a CDC report  released earlier this month.The authors warned that the rapid increase in cases ""represents a renewed threat to elimination.""Most cases reported this year were  linked to international travel , and the majority were among people who had not received a measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine or whose vaccination status was unknown.Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective, but the CDC said in an  advisory  to health care providers   last month that ""pockets of low [vaccination] coverage leave some communities at higher risk for outbreaks.""This year's early spike in measles cases was driven in part by outbreaks centered in a  migrant shelter in Chicago , an  elementary school in southeast Florida  and a  children’s hospital and a day care center in Philadelphia .Chicago continues to confront its outbreak. As of Monday, its  case count had reached 63 , with the most recent recorded last week. More than half of the cases were among children under age 5.Though disease experts have expressed concern about the early rise in cases, the U.S. isn’t close to its total from 2019, when the country nearly lost its measles elimination status. Most of the 1,249 cases that year were associated with  outbreaks in Orthodox Jewish communities  in New York.Measles is highly contagious: An infected person can spread it to  up to 90% of people close to them  if those contacts aren’t immune. Thanks to widespread vaccination, measles was eliminated in the U.S. in 2000 — meaning that it’s no longer constantly present, though there are still occasional outbreaks. Most people who get measles now are unvaccinated. Children in the U.S. are meant to get their first vaccine dose between 12 and 15 months and their second between 4 and 6 years old. However, vaccination rates have fallen in the last few years. For nearly a decade, 95% of U.S. kindergartners had received two doses of the MMR vaccine. That rate fell to 94% in the 2020–21 year, then to 93% in the 2022–23 school year.Measles symptoms usually start  with a high fever, cough, conjunctivitis (pink eye) and runny nose. Two to three days later, people may notice tiny white spots in their mouth. On days three to five of symptoms, a blotchy rash often forms at the hairline before spreading to the rest of the body.Some people may  develop severe complications  from measles, including pneumonia, swelling of the brain or a secondary bacterial infection. Before measles vaccines became available in 1963, around 48,000 people were hospitalized and 400 to 500 people died of the disease each year in the U.S. Today,  1 in 5 unvaccinated people  who get measles are hospitalized, and roughly 1 to 3 out of every 1,000 children with measles die from respiratory and neurological complications, according to the CDC.",2024-03-27 20:54:00 PM EET,NBC,This year's measles case total is now the highest in the U.S. since 2019,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/us-measles-cases-2024-so-far-rcna145013
Ken Dilanian,"Reacting for the first time to former President Donald Trump’s vow to order the Justice Department to  investigate his political opponents , FBI Director Christopher Wray said he would not allow his agents to conduct any investigation that doesn’t comply with “our rules, our procedures, our best practices, our core values.”In an interview Tuesday  with NBC News' Lester Holt at FBI headquarters, Wray said that, as long as he is FBI director, he is “going to make sure … we do the right thing in the right way.""""And that means following the law, following our rules, staying faithful to our core values, enforcing the law without fear or favor,"" he added.FBI  rules  prohibit agents from opening an investigation without evidence of criminality, and Justice Department  rules  say agents may never make a decision regarding an investigation or prosecution for the purpose of giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party. Wray was appointed by Trump to a 10-year term in 2017. Asked if he would want to continue serving as FBI director if Trump was re-elected, Wray responded, “I’m enjoying doing this job. I love the people, the men and women of the FBI, who are some of the finest people I’ve ever had a chance to work with. And as long as I think I can continue doing that in a way that adheres to all those rules and norms, it’s what I’d like to keep doing.”Trump repeatedly publicly criticized Wray before he left office in 2021, and he has blasted the FBI ever since, especially for its role in the  2022 search of his Mar-a-Lago home  for classified documents. So it’s widely believed Trump would seek to remove Wray and appoint a new director if he was elected.In response to a question, Wray also broke with Trump over the former president’s  characterization  of Jan. 6 defendants as “hostages.”“I see the defendants in the Jan. 6 cases as criminal defendants who are being charged with federal crimes, and are in front of independent courts as part of our legal system,” Wray said. “In our country, there are all sorts of people who are upset and angry about all sorts of things, about all sorts of people. But there is a right way under the First Amendment to express how upset you are. And violence — violence against law enforcement, destruction of federal property — is not it.”In the wide-ranging interview, Wray also discussed an array of national security threats, including from terrorism, cyberattacks, and the Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok.Asked about protests and violence on college campuses over the Israel-Hamas war, he said the FBI is “keenly focused on working with state and local law enforcement, campus law enforcement, others to try to make sure that we stay ahead” of the threat of antisemitic violence” and prevent violence against the Jewish community.”He said the FBI doesn’t monitor protests, but it does “share intelligence about specific threats of violence with campuses, with state and local law enforcement.”Wray reiterated comments he has made recently underscoring that the threat from terrorism since Oct. 7 is as high as it has been in some time, especially from lone actors or small groups radicalized at home by the war. But he said there are also elevated fears about a coordinated terror attack in a public place, a prospect that for the last decade has been seen by intelligence officials as extremely remote.“We are increasingly concerned [about] the potential for some kind of coordinated attack here in the homeland, which may be not that different from what you saw against the concert hall in Russia a few weeks ago from ISIS-K,” he said.Asked to describe the real world national security threat from TikTok, as Congress  moves toward passing  a bill requiring its Chinese owner to sell the platform, Wray was emphatic.He said national security officials are concerned that TikTok provides Chinese intelligence services “the ability to collect the data, the ability to control the recommendation algorithm, which means the ability to push CCP narratives, pro-CCP narratives, downplay criticism of the Chinese government, in effect, enlist millions of users as unwitting advocates of CCP propaganda.”He added that the Chinese government also has “the ability to control the software, which gives the opportunity to technically compromise the devices, the phones, millions and millions of phones.”Asked what he would say to the millions of people in the United States who regularly use TikTok for business or pleasure and simply don’t care about the perceived risks, Wray said, “My message is, you need to take into account who the Chinese government is, who the Chinese Communist Party is.”Wray also restated his  assessments  that China, Russia and Iran may seek to interfere in the upcoming election, and that all three countries continue to conduct cyber espionage and offensive cyber operations against the United States. China, he said, is positioning itself to be able to knock out critical infrastructure in the event the U.S. seeks to defend Taiwan from a Chinese invasion.Chinese cyber bombs planted on critical infrastructure, he said, “would allow them to induce panic or break America’s will to resist in something like, let’s say, an effort by the Chinese government to move on Taiwan.”Wray lamented the uptick in threats of violence against public officials, including FBI agents.“Certainly we’ve seen over the last few years an increase in threats against FBI personnel and FBI facilities,” he said. “That’s unacceptable. And, you know, frankly, despicable. But it’s part of a broader phenomenon of threats and violence against law enforcement, public officials. Anytime you start talking about threatening people just for doing their jobs, it is really outrageous.""""Having a badge shouldn’t make you a target,"" he added.Asked what he thinks is driving the threats, Wray said, “There’s a broad phenomenon right now of people across the spectrum across the country who, when they’re upset about something, have chosen to use violence as a way to manifest that. And that’s incredibly dangerous and problematic.""He added that he believes there is another factor fueling the threats: that some Americans don't view an FBI investigation, a trial or a court case as fair or legitimate unless the result was ""what they wanted.""""That can’t be the standard of fairness, objectivity and legitimacy, or we’re in a hell of a pickle,"" Wray said.",2024-04-24 01:30:00 AM EEST,NBC,FBI director rejects Trump's vow to investigate political rivals,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/fbi-director-rejects-trumps-vow-investigate-political-rivals-rcna149056
"Josh Lederman,Kate Brannelly","LONDON — In a global first for equality in sports, wheelchair athletes and non-disabled runners participating in the London Marathon on Sunday were competing for the exact same prize money.The move makes the event the only marathon in the world to award winners the same sum — $55,000 for first place, $30,000 for the runners-up and $22,500 for third-place finishers. Organizers said they were unaware of any other major athletic event in any sport that has taken a similar step.By equalizing the prize pot, marathon organizers have said they hope to pave the way for other races and sporting events to offer parity, encouraging more athletes to participate in disability sport and removing financial barriers to participation. The parity extends to gender: Both male and female wheelchair athletes are eligible for equal prize amounts.The men's wheelchair division race was won by Marcel Hug, a Paralympian widely considered the world’s best wheelchair racer, who cheered the decision ahead of the race.“The London Marathon is setting a great and strong but also courageous example for equality and inclusion that should go beyond the world of sport and hopefully inspires in other areas, too,” Hug told NBC News.Hug crossed the line in one hour, 28 minutes and 35 seconds in London to claim his fifth victory.American athlete Daniel Romanchuk placed second behind Hug. In third was British wheelchair racing star David Weir, a six-time Paralympic gold medalist who’s won the London race eight times before — more than any other athlete. Swiss athlete Catherine Debrunne won the women's event with a time of one hour, 3 minutes and 54 seconds. Manuela Schar, also from Switzerland came in second and American Tatyana McFadden placed third.In Boston, the top prize for the wheelchair division was $40,000. In the open division, the non-disabled male and female winners took home $150,000 — more than three times as much.The 26.2-mile race in London kicked off Sunday morning south of the Thames River, crossing over Tower Bridge and passing iconic London landmarks like the Tower of London, the London Eye and the Big Ben before reaching the finish line near Buckingham Palace. Hugh Brasher, the London Marathon’s event director, cast the move as part of an evolution toward greater inclusion for athletes with disabilities that started in 1983 when the London race held its first wheelchair event, and continued with multiple International Paralympic Committee World Championships held since then in the British capital.Romanchuk, 25, who grew up in Maryland, applauded the decision to equalize the prize structure, predicting it would have “huge effects beyond race day.”“London Marathon’s equal prize money helps elevate perception of the sport to reflect the reality that we’re professional athletes, training and competing just like other professional athletes,” Romanchuk told NBC News as he traveled to London for the race. “My main hope is that it brings more visibility to the sport so that more athletes with disabilities can see the possibility of having an active lifestyle and participate in community running races.”Another reason why equalizing the financial aspect of sports is important, Romanchuk said, is that the high cost of specialized equipment for wheelchair racing often prevents lower-income athletes from getting involved. He said adaptive sports equipment starts at several thousands of dollars at entry level — far more than the pair of running shoes that a nondisabled athlete would need to start competing.Romanchuk said he’d first gotten involved in adaptive sports when he was 2 years old, describing the effect it had on his development and self-confidence.“They taught me to focus on what I did have — two strong arms — instead of what I didn’t have,” said Romanchuk, who was born with spina bifida, a congenital defect that affects the spinal cord. “The fact that my legs didn’t work normally was never an acceptable reason why I couldn’t reach a particular goal.”",2024-04-20 15:31:00 PM EEST,NBC,London Marathon gives same prize money to wheelchair athletes,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/london-marathon-award-wheelchair-non-disabledd-athletes-equal-prize-mo-rcna148524
"Adam Reiss,Dareh Gregorian,Lisa Rubin","Prosecutors in  Donald Trump's hush money trial  asserted Tuesday that the former president has been violating a  gag order  barring him from attacking witnesses on social media in an attempt to get locked up for political purposes.Debate over the order, which took place in a hearing before the jury returned to the courtroom,   included the judge telling a defense lawyer that he was ""losing all credibility"" with his argument that Trump was being ""very careful to comply"" with the gag order. Lawyers with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office argued that Trump should be held in  criminal contempt  over a series of posts on Truth Social that they say violated Judge Juan Merchan’s  gag order .“The purpose of this hearing is to find out whether the defendant Mr. Trump should be held  in contempt  for one or all of these violations,” Judge Juan Merchan said as the hearing began.Prosecutor Chris Conroy said the DA's office was not yet seeking to have Trump jailed over the gag order, while adding that he ""seems to be angling for that.""The judge's order prohibits Trump from publicly attacking witnesses and jurors, something prosecutors say he’s done at least 10 times since the order went into effect.The DA’s office is seeking the maximum $1,000 fine for each of the 10 posts it says violated the order, along with an order that Trump remove the posts from his social media platform. It also wants Merchan to warn Trump any future violations risk not just additional fines but also as long as 30 days in jail.“His disobedience of the order is willful, it’s intentional,” Conroy said. “He knows what he’s not allowed to do and he does it anyway.”Trump attorney Todd Blanche argued “there was absolutely no willful violation” of the April 1 order and said his client was merely responding to a “barrage of political attacks.”When Merchan pressed Blanche on what specific attacks Trump was responding to when he made the posts, the attorney struggled to answer.“I keep asking you over and over to give me an example and I’m not getting an answer,” the judge said, appearing frustrated.Merchan reserved a decision on the issue until a later time, but he made clear that he was not impressed by the arguments from Trump's legal team. Prosecutors, he said, had presented him with relevant case law. ""You have presented nothing,"" the judge told Blanche.Trump did not seem concerned during Blanche’s exchange with the judge — he sat with his eyes closed for a portion of it. He took to Truth Social immediately after the hearing to vent about the judge and Mark Pomerantz, a former prosecutor in the DA’s office. (The judge is not covered by the order.) The post questioned whether Pomerantz will be “prosecuted.”The heated back and forth came before the jury was brought into the room  to hear testimony  from a key witness in case, former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker, who outlined the “catch and kill” scheme between himself, Trump and Michael Cohen that prosecutors say ultimately led Trump to break the law by falsifying business records. Trump has pleaded not guilty.<h2>A 'mutually beneficial' agreement</h2>During his opening statement Monday, prosecutor Matthew Colangelo said Pecker conspired with his longtime friend Trump and  Cohen , who was then Trump's lawyer, in an effort to suppress scandalous stories about Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign.""They agreed that Pecker would help the defendant's campaign by acting as eyes and ears for the campaign,"" Colangelo said.It was Pecker who alerted Cohen to the news that adult film star Stormy Daniels was about to come forward with a claim that she had had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006, when he was married, Colangelo said. Trump has denied her claim.Cohen ultimately paid Daniels $130,000 to get her to sign a nondisclosure agreement. Prosecutors allege that Trump falsely claimed his reimbursement to Cohen as legal payments. He’s charged with  34 counts  of falsifying business records, a low-level felony, and faces up to four years in prison if he’s convicted. He has pleaded not guilty.Pecker testified Tuesday that he'd known Trump since the late 1980s and had ""a great relationship with Mr. Trump over the years."" He said that when he purchased the Enquirer in 1999, Trump told him: “Congratulations! You have purchased a great magazine.”Pecker said Trump later became a source for news on his hit show ""The Apprentice."" He said they generally spoke every few months, but their contacts became more frequent after Trump declared he was running for president in 2015. Pecker also said he attended Trump's campaign announcement at Trump Tower after Cohen told him he should be there.""No one deserves to be there more than you,"" Cohen told him in an email that was shown to the jury.He then recounted a meeting he had at Trump Tower with Cohen and Trump in August 2015, which is when prosecutors said the election scheme was hatched. Pecker said the pair asked him what he could do to help the campaign.""I said what I would do is I would run, or publish, positive stories about Mr. Trump, and I would publish negative stories about his opponents,"" Pecker recounted, adding he also told them he'd be their ""eyes and ears"" on stories that could be damaging.He said he ""thought that a lot of women would come out to try to sell their stories because Mr. Trump was well known as the most eligible bachelor and dated the most beautiful women. And it was clear that based on my past experience, that when someone was running for public office like this, it is very common for these women to call up magazines like the National Enquirer to try to sell their stories.”They agreed if that happened, Pecker would notify Cohen, and ""he would be able to kill"" the stories, Pecker said. He called the agreement ""mutually beneficial"" because he thought the positive Trump stories — and negative stories about his opponents — would help the paper's newsstand sales.He said Cohen would call and say ""we would like you to run an article"" on a specific target, and the Enquirer would ""embellish it from there."" Asked who the ""we"" was that Cohen referred to, Pecker said he understood it to mean Cohen and Trump. He said he would send Cohen copies of the stories before they published, and would sometimes make additions requested by Cohen.    The articles included  stories  about then-Trump rivals — and now allies — Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Ben Carson. The headlines included “Boozin Ted Cruz Fixin To Lose” and “Bungling Surgeon Ben Carson Left Sponge in Patient’s Brain!"" Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass also asked Pecker about a notorious headline linking Cruz's father to the John F. Kennedy assassination. Pecker said the story was ""created"" by mashing together pictures of Cruz's father and Lee Harvey Oswald.Cruz accused Trump of being behind the Enquirer stories at time, something Trump denied in a March 2016  statement , saying, ""I have nothing to do with the National Enquirer and unlike Lyin’ Ted Cruz I do not surround myself with political hacks and henchmen and then pretend total innocence.""<h2>Catch and kill</h2>Pecker then described the first of three stories prosecutors said he helped to kill in order to aid Trump. He said that in October of 2015, Enquirer editor Dylan Howard reached out to him — as he'd been instructed to do — with a salacious Trump story. A doorman at one of Trump's New York buildings,  Dino Sajudin , was ""selling a story that Donald Trump fathered an illegitimate girl with a maid in — at — at Trump Tower, and may have worked in his — in Mr. Trump’s penthouse.”He said he ""immediately"" called Cohen, who didn't think the allegation was true but said he would check it out. In the meantime, Howard negotiated to buy the rights to Sajudin's story for $30,000. Pecker said he told Cohen, “I’ll pay for it. This’ll be a very big story. I believe it’s important he should be removed from the market, so we’ll acquire the story.”The deal included a $1 million penalty if the doorman spoke about it to anyone else.Cohen told him ""the boss"" was ""very pleased,"" Pecker said, adding that he didn't discuss the plan directly with Trump — only with Cohen.""Prior to this arrangement to purchase this story from Dino, had you ever paid a source to kill a story about Donald Trump?” Steinglass asked.“No,” Pecker answered. He added that it was much more than the tabloid would typically pay for a story — especially since Howard hired investigators who determined the doorman's story was ""absolutely 1,000% untrue.""Pecker said he eventually wanted to release the doorman from agreement because he was ""difficult,"" but that Cohen asked him not do so until ""after the election."" Pecker said he agreed.The Playboy modelPecker recounted another tip Howard got in June of 2016 involving  Karen McDougal , ""a Playboy model who is trying to sell the story about a relationship that she had with Donald Trump for a year.”Pecker said he again alerted Cohen, who told him he didn't think the claim was true. He told Cohen he'd keep him ""apprised"" of any developments. He said he then got a call from Trump, who said Cohen ""told me about Karen."" He said Trump asked him, ""What do you think?"" Pecker said he suggested to Trump that he buy the story, but Trump demurred and said, “I don't buy any stories."" ""Anytime you do anything like this, it always gets out,” he quoted Trump as saying.Pecker said Howard arranged an interview with McDougal, and Cohen called several times while it was happening. ""He kept on calling, and each time he called he seemed more anxious,"" Pecker said, adding that he believed but did not know that Cohen was being pressed for details by Trump.Trump has denied McDougal's claim of an affair.<h2>Trump's social media posts</h2>The contempt hearing on Tuesday morning focused on prosecutors' allegation in two court filings that Trump ""willfully violated"" the gag order with repeated posts on Truth Social. The cited posts include one that referred to Cohen and Daniels as ""sleaze bags"" and others that linked to a New York Post story calling Cohen a ""serial perjurer.""The partial gag order Merchan slapped on Trump this month bars him from making “public statements about known or reasonably foreseeable witnesses concerning their potential participation in the investigation or in this criminal proceeding.”Trump's attorneys have argued that the posts didn't violate the order because he was largely sharing posts from other people and news outlets, and the posts are political speech. Asked by the judge what case law he had to support that position, Blanche said he didn't have any, but ""it's just common sense.""Blanche defended one of the posts about Daniels, saying it concerned her credibility, not her anticipated testimony.“Her credibility doesn’t matter a whole lot if she doesn’t take the stand in this trial,” Merchan said.Conroy told the judge that Trump's use of his acronym for his campaign slogan ""Make America Great Again"" in some of the posts doesn't change the nature of their message.“Throwing a ‘MAGA’ into a post doesn’t make it political. It may make it more ominous,” he said.Trump's lawyers have also contended that the order allows Trump to defend himself from attacks, so he was within his rights to speak out because Cohen and Daniels have criticized him publicly. Merchan said last week that he doesn't believe his order makes such an exception.Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office also cited comments Trump made to reporters Monday, when he repeatedly called Cohen a liar. Conroy said he’d be filing another motion on those comments later Tuesday.Court proceedings for the day ended earlier than normal because of the Passover holiday.As previously stated by the judge, the court will not be in session on Wednesday.

The pair tied the knot in a televised ceremony in January after meeting last fall on the first season of ""The Golden Bachelor,"" a spinoff of the long-running ABC dating reality show ""The Bachelor."" Nist, 70, thanked fans for their support. ""I don’t think we can tell you how many people told us that it gave them so much hope,"" she said. ""We want none of that to change for anybody.""Turner and Nist did not say what led up to their split but suggested they had trouble deciding where to live. Nist is a  financial services professional from New Jersey  and Turner is a retired restaurateur from Indiana.

Zoë Richards,"Lawmakers in Tennessee passed a measure Tuesday that would allow school staff to carry concealed handguns on school grounds, sending the bill to the governor a year after a  shooter opened fire and killed six people  at a Nashville school.The Tennessee House cleared the legislation in a  68-28 vote . Four Republicans joined Democrats in opposing the measure.   The state Senate, which is also controlled by the GOP,  passed the measure  earlier this month.Republican state Rep. Ryan Williams on Tuesday said the bill would bolster school safety.""I believe that this is a method by which we can do that, because what you're doing is you're creating a deterrent,"" he said on the House floor.Under the legislation, faculty and staff members who wish to carry a concealed handgun on school grounds would need to   complete a minimum of 40 hours of approved training specific to school policing each year.Protesters could be heard in the gallery on Tuesday chanting, “Blood on your hands,” during the floor proceedings.Democratic state Rep. Bo Mitchell pushed back on the measure, referring to last year's Covenant School shooting in Nashville when three children and three adults were killed.""This is what we’re going to do. This is our reaction to teachers and children being murdered in a school, our reaction is gonna throw more guns at it. What’s wrong with us?"" Mitchell said on the House floor.State Sen. Paul Bailey, a Republican who sponsored the bill in the upper chamber, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.A spokesperson for Republican Gov. Bill Lee did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether he planned to sign the measure. He can either sign the bill or allow it to become law without his signature. Lee has not vetoed any legislation as governor.Tennessee isn’t the only state to approve legislation allowing teachers to carry guns.

"Allan Smith,Bridget Bowman","Pennsylvania primary voters will cast ballots Tuesday in a series of critical races in the key battleground state, even as both the presidential and Senate primaries are mere formalities.They include  a bitterly fought Democratic primary around Pittsburgh  and a primary in eastern Pennsylvania that features a moderate Republican seeking to fend off a right-wing challenger. What’s more, activists upset with President Joe Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war are urging Democrats to write “uncommitted” on the  state’s primary ballot . And in the GOP primary, Republicans looking to cast protest votes against former President Donald Trump can still find former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, who ended her campaign last month, on their ballots. Pennsylvania is one of the most evenly divided states in the country, so both parties will be searching for any clues the primary may offer about the November election.With polls closing at 8 p.m. ET., here’s what to watch for Tuesday.<h2>A House district where the war in Gaza is front and center</h2>In the 12th Congressional District, Democratic Rep.  Summer Lee  faces a challenge from Edgewood Borough Council member Bhavini Patel in a race that has put the Israel-Hamas war front and center.Lee, a member of the progressive “squad” in Congress and one of the first lawmakers to call for a cease-fire, has accused the Israeli government of committing “war crimes” and called for an end to unconditional military aid to the country, and on Saturday she joined 36 Democrats and 21 Republicans in voting against an aid package to the country, which passed overwhelmingly. She and Republican Rep. Scott Perry were the only Pennsylvania members to vote against it.Patel, who launched her campaign days before Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, has sought to cut into Lee’s support by saying her refusal to distance herself from groups and activists calling for an “uncommitted” primary vote will hurt Biden this fall.Lee, who won her first primary race in 2022 after she overcame a raft of spending from groups aligned with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, is looking stronger this time around. She’s well-defined in the district and has framed her bid around taking on Trump-aligned Republicans and bringing federal dollars to the district. The same AIPAC-aligned groups that fought her last time aren’t spending on the race this time around.The district includes Squirrel Hill, one of the country’s most prominent historically Jewish neighborhoods and site of the massacre at the  Tree of Life synagogue , where a white supremacist killed 11 worshippers in 2018. It was the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history.Lee has called on Hamas to release hostages it still holds and has repeatedly spoken out against antisemitism.“We have communities that are hurting. The Jewish community is one of them. And there are people who are … not going to agree 100% on everything that you say,” Lee said in an interview, adding she has been “very clear and very upfront” about her cease-fire position. “I have condemned Hamas. We’ve worked with the families of hostages; we’ve done everything that I think is necessary to do that. And at the end of the day, we disagree.”The race will be an early test of whether sentiment about the war in Gaza will play a significant role in races this year.<h2>Setting up a critical Senate race</h2>Democratic Sen. Bob Casey and Republican challenger Dave McCormick are poised to cruise to victories Tuesday,  setting up a key contest  in the fight for control of the Senate.McCormick, who lost the GOP primary in 2022 to Trump-backed celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, managed to clear the field ahead of this bid and rallied a Pennsylvania Republican establishment behind him that was tired of the infighting that contributed to defeats up and down the ballot in the midterms. It’s a dynamic that has allowed him to focus on the general election battle against Casey from the get-go.The two will soon be fighting in what will be one of the most expensive Senate races of the cycle. Casey, a three-term senator whose father was governor of Pennsylvania, regularly out-polls Biden in the state, where Democrats have enjoyed victory after victory since Trump’s stunning upset over Hillary Clinton in 2016.The race could determine which party holds the majority in the Senate, where Democrats hold a 51-49 advantage. <h2>A moderate Republican on defense</h2>Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick has  built a brand as a moderate Republican , so he has often attracted primary challengers from the right. This year, Fitzpatrick isn’t taking any chances in his primary race against anti-abortion-rights activist Mark Houck.Fitzpatrick’s campaign has spent nearly $2 million so far, according to recent campaign finance reports, far outspending Houck, who has dropped $145,000 and had just $11,000 left in his account as of April 3. Fitzpatrick’s campaign had nearly $3.7 million on hand. Houck grabbed headlines for his arrest after an altercation with a Planned Parenthood volunteer, and he  was acquitted last year . Fitzpatrick’s campaign has launched multiple negative TV ads against Houck, as well as spots bolstering his own conservative credentials. In one ad, Fitzpatrick says, “The far left is attacking the very ideals that brought so many to our shores, indoctrinating our kids with anti-American hate and leaving our borders wide open.” The primary race  has drawn attention from outside groups, with two super PACs spending in the race to bolster Fitzpatrick: the Defending America PAC and the Congressional Leadership Fund, which is aligned with House GOP leadership. A group tied to Democrats has also  meddled in the primary , Politico reported.Fitzpatrick, a former FBI agent, has been an elusive target for Democrats looking to flip the competitive 1st District in the Philadelphia suburbs. If he wins the primary, Fitzpatrick will once again face Democrat Ashley Ehasz, an Army veteran whom he defeated by 10 points in 2022 even after Biden won the district by 5 points two years previously, according to calculations from  Daily Kos Elections . The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter rates the 1st District race as  likely Republican . <h2>Setting up battleground House matchups</h2>Tuesday’s primaries will also solidify the matchups in four other competitive House districts. Two of them are already set, with businessman Rob Bresnahan the only Republican in the race to take on Democratic Rep. Matt Cartwright in the 8th District and state Rep. Rob Mercuri the only Republican taking on Democratic Rep. Chris Deluzio in the 17th District. But there are competitive primaries to take on two other Pennsylvania lawmakers in battleground districts: Democratic Rep. Susan Wild and GOP Rep. Scott Perry. In Wild’s 7th District north of Philadelphia, the top Republicans include state Rep. Ryan Mackenzie and Kevin Dellicker, who owns a technology company. Mackenzie has support from the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity Action, while Dellicker has slightly outspent Mackenzie in the primary.Wild won a third term in 2022 by just 2 points, and Biden won her district by less than 1 point in 2020. The Cook Political Report rates the race a  toss-up .In the 10th District, which includes Harrisburg, six Democrats are competing to take on Perry, the former chairman of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus. The top contenders include Marine veteran Mike O’Brien, who was a TOPGUN pilot, and former local TV news anchor Janelle Stelson, who has support from EMILY’s List, a group that backs female candidates who support abortion rights. While Democrats believe Perry is vulnerable, especially given his  clashes with the Justice Department’s investigation  into efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, Democrats would face an uphill climb in a district Trump won by 4 points in 2020. The Cook Political Report rates the race as  lean Republican . <h2>Biden protest vote</h2>Biden is his party’s presumptive presidential nominee, but activists opposed to the war in Gaza are once again calling on Democrats to cast votes to protest the administration’s support for Israel. A coalition of groups called “Uncommitted PA” is urging voters to write in “uncommitted” in the Democratic presidential primary,  following similar efforts in other primary states . The group is looking for 40,000 write-in votes, about half of Biden’s margin of victory in Pennsylvania in 2020. Only registered Democrats can participate in Tuesday’s primary.CORRECTION  (April 23, 2024, 1:30 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the   first   name of Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick’s Republican primary challenger. He   is Mark Houck, not Matt.",2024-04-23 13:00:00 PM EEST,NBC,What to watch for in Tuesday's Pennsylvania primaries,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/what-to-watch-watch-pennsylvania-primary-rcna148017
Katherine Doyle,"Testimony in Donald Trump’s historic hush money case resumed Tuesday, with prosecutors urging the court to hold the former president in contempt for attacking witnesses and others, and former tabloid impresario David Pecker returning to the stand with details that linked Trump’s circle to a slew of salacious stories.Earlier, as Trump awaited the hearing over the gag order in the case,  his fundraising appeals took on a frantic tone. Deliberations stretched on for more than an hour, but the judge presiding over the case, Juan Merchan, opted to wait and rule later. It left in limbo Trump’s assertion that he had not willfully violated the order, as his attorney vowed, and any consequences if the judge rules that he did. And Trump continued to rail against the gag order. Here is what you missed on Day 6 of Trump’s hush money trial:Witness David Pecker returned to the standPecker, the former CEO of AMI and publisher of the National Enquirer, described giving directions to implement an agreement with Trump to help his 2016 presidential campaign. Pecker said the Enquirer had “embellished” stories about some of Trump’s opponents at Michael Cohen’s request, including a piece about the father of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, being involved in the assassination of John F. KennedyThe publication had “mashed the photos” together of Lee Harvey Oswald and Cruz’s father, Pecker said, conceding that an article Trump cited repeatedly on the campaign trail was a fabrication.Prosecutors implicate Steve Bannon — and identify Trump’s alleged ‘primary’ crime Under questioning, Pecker recounted how Trump introduced him to Steve Bannon, a top adviser to Trump’s 2016 campaign.   He and Bannon “would work well together,” the publisher said Trump told him.“I believe that you and Steve would get along really well,” Pecker said Trump told him in October 2016. Asked if Bannon had ever pitched him stories, Pecker said Bannon had suggested how a reporter from the National Enquirer could appear on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show to discuss the articles with Hannity.Doing so would reach an audience of millions. At the time, Fox News had surged to become the most-watched cable news channel, with Hannity, a high-profile Trump ally, enjoying the biggest ratings boost of any host on the network in October that year —  a 65% jump over the previous month , according to Nielsen ratings. Amid objections from the defense, who said they had no notice that Bannon was being considered a co-conspirator, the prosecution argued that the requests are relevant to the “primary” underlying crime, New York Election Law 17-152.The law prohibits conspiracies to promote the election of a specific candidate through unlawful means.Cohen’s involvement Pecker said he believed Cohen to be a stand-in for Trump because of how involved he had been in Trump’s business operations and that this continued into the campaign. He detailed that as the negotiations over buying stories grew, he talked to Cohen daily. Trump’s lawyer, Pecker testified, told him to stop using a landline phone and instead begin using a secure messaging app called Signal, which deletes messages after a period of time. As Trump’s rivals gained ground during the presidential primary, the National Enquirer would publish stories crafted to impugn their credibility.“‘Family Man’ Marco Rubio’s Love Child Stunner,” read one headline that is among the exhibits in the trial. Another promised to detail “Senator Marco Rubio’s cocaine connection.” Rubio, a Florida Republican, denied those stories at the time and Pecker suggested that they were published without evidence. Pecker detailed the scheme like so:“After the Republican debates, and based on the success that some of the other candidates had, I would receive a call from Michael Cohen, and he would direct me and direct Dylan Howard which candidate and which direction we should go,” he said. “That’s how the process happened.” There were other stories designed to offer Trump a boost, including a piece about Trump’s wife, Melania, and “how she inspired Trump to run.” Another claimed that Barack Obama’s half-brother was “cheering on Donald Trump at debate.” Conversations with TrumpPecker explained his relationship “over the years” with Trump, and how he got to know him. “I would describe Mr. Trump as very knowledgeable. I would describe him very detail-oriented. I would describe him almost micromanaging,” Pecker said, amid a discussion over payments.  “Looking at all the aspects of whatever the issue was,” he said.Pecker later told the courtroom how he and Trump had talked every couple of weeks. On rare occasions, it was Trump’s bodyguard Keith Schiller who would sometimes pass messages to him.Pecker also testified that he took actions he would not have taken otherwise to protect Trump. Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass asked if Pecker had paid $30,000 for an untrue story as “a way to lock it up.”Pecker said that, yes, he sought to bury it to avoid “potential embarrassment” to Trump and was prepared to spend a sum far out of the ordinary to do so. Merchan reserved judgment on the gag orderAn attorney for the district attorney’s office argued that Trump “seems to be angling” for incarceration by repeatedly and knowingly violating the gag order. Prosecutors had asked that he be held in contempt for attacking witnesses and others in the case, saying that they aren’t asking that Trump be imprisoned but want him fined for at least 10 violations.The charge came just hours after Trump warned in a fundraising appeal, which he called a “FAREWELL MESSAGE,” that he “could be thrown in jail.”Trump has been awaiting the hearing on the gag order since last week and, in the meantime, has continued to jab at witnesses in the case outside the courtroom, on his campaign website and on social media.One New York Post article Trump shared that was cited by prosecutors referred to Cohen as a “serial perjurer [who] will try to prove an old misdemeanor.” Trump, on the first day of the trial, posted it twice on Truth Social and on his campaign website. He did it again the following day.“The defendant is having his day in court and he is doing everything he can to try to undermine that process,” said prosecutor Chris Conroy. He said the prosecution would file another order arguing statements Trump made about Cohen on Monday in the courthouse hallway also violated the order.But Trump’s lawyer insisted the   gag order had not been willfully violated. He is facing a “barrage” of attacks from people “who can say whatever they want,” while he cannot respond, said Todd Blanche.Merchan grew visibly frustrated as Blanche continued to make the case for Trump. “He’s saying there are two systems of justice  in this courtroom ?” Merchan asked. Blanche responded, “Yes, your honor. That’s what his message is.” The judge pressed Trump’s attorney to show him the exact post that Trump was responding to. “I’ve asked you eight or nine times,” said Merchan. “You’ve been unable to do that even once.” Trump, seated at the defense table, kept his eyes closed and appeared disinterested. Blanche, asked whether the defense had any other arguments to hand up, responded that they are “trying to comply” with the gag order. “President Trump is being very careful,” he said.Merchan snapped, “You’re losing all credibility with the court.”",2024-04-24 00:19:00 AM EEST,NBC,What you missed on Day 6 of Trump’s trial: A witness details salacious stories and the judge bristles at gag order arguments,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-trial-day-6-missed-recap-summary-rcna149075
The Associated Press,"BATON ROUGE, La. — As transgender people in Louisiana watched surrounding states in the deeply conservative South implement a slew of laws targeting nearly every facet of their lives in recent years, they counted on their ally in the governor’s office to keep their home a relative oasis.Former Gov. John Bel Edwards, the only statewide elected Democrat at the time, was indeed able to block  most of the bills .But this year, nothing stands in the way. Edwards has been  replaced by Gov. Jeff Landry , a Republican backed by former President Donald Trump who has shown support for such legislation. And the GOP holds a two-thirds supermajority in the Legislature. That means previously introduced legislation hostile to transgender people now has a clear path forward, as do new proposals.“These bills are absolutely going to become law,” said SarahJane Guidry, executive director of the LGBTQ rights group Forum for Equality. “And that is such a tragedy, but it doesn’t end there. We are going to continue to fight.”As the only Democratic governor in the Deep South at the time, Edwards used vetoes to block anti-transgender legislation, including one  broadly barring teachers  from discussing gender identity and sexual orientation in schools, a type of policy critics have dubbed “Don’t Say Gay”; and a measure requiring public school teachers to  use the pronouns and names  students were assigned at birth.In a veto message, Edwards described the bills as discriminatory, extremist and harmful to a group “comprised of the most vulnerable, fragile children” in Louisiana.He was unable to keep the Legislature from overriding his veto of a  ban on gender-affirming medical care  for transgender minors. And he blocked a 2021 bill seeking to restrict transgender athletes’ access to sports, but allowed it become law the next year, knowing a veto would probably be overridden.Now that Edwards is out of office because of term limits, the Republican-controlled Legislature is advancing the “Don’t Say Gay” and pronoun and name proposals; definitions of male and female that could effectively legally erase transgender people; and  restrictions on the use  of bathrooms and changing rooms in schools, domestic violence shelters and prisons. President Joe Biden’s administration has said a  new federal rule  could clash with such bathroom restrictions.The situation in Louisiana mirrors a  national flood of bills  that have targeted transgender people, and especially youths, in recent years, a movement some observers say seeks more to  motivate conservative voters  than to solve real problems.A report  released Tuesday by the Williams Institute, a research center at UCLA Law, estimates that about 93% of transgender youths ages 13-17, or about 280,000, live in states that have proposed or passed laws restricting their access to health care, sports, school bathrooms and facilities, or the use of gender-affirming pronouns.The institute estimates that in Louisiana, about 4,000 people ages 13-17, or 1.3% of that age group, identify as transgender.Landry’s office did not respond to an email seeking comment on this year’s legislation. But he has made no secret of his support for, among other things, restrictions on gender-affirming care for minors. In 2023, when he was running for governor, he posted on X: “As attorney general for 8 years I have worked hard to protect our children. I urge the full Senate to take up and pass” the law. It eventually passed and was vetoed but overridden.Advocates in the Bayou State are organizing their fight, looking to other states that have blocked similar measures in court, educating their communities on the imminent laws, seeking sanctuary city policies, and recruiting more residents to their cause.“We’re not going to look to the apocalypse, we’re going to look to the revolution,” Guidry said.Advocates want the city council in liberal New Orleans to create local protections for transgender people, such as refusing to enforce state laws targeting them. Other cities like Austin, Texas, and  Kansas City, Missouri,  have already taken similar actions, though it’s not clear how effective the protections have been.Last month, hundreds marched in New Orleans’ French Quarter. Transgender residents continue to testify in the Capitol. Advocates try to work with conservative lawmakers to create amendments to soften legislation. Students took to the Capitol steps in Baton Rouge last month to  perform a play they wrote , based on their own experiences about how the bills would affect them.“It’s almost like the Twilight Zone,” said William Leighton, who drove four hours to the Capitol this month with his 13-year-old transgender daughter, Arielle, who was not in the play.“It’s not fair. I really don’t like the fact that people like me are being discriminated (against) for being different,” said Arielle, who is in eighth grade.William Leighton had already prepared a letter to send to Arielle’s teachers, granting permission to use her name and pronouns, but he decided that was not enough and needed to get more politically active.He was recently elected to the state’s Democratic State Central Committee. Among his priorities are to get more Democrats to vote and find candidates who, if elected to the Legislature, would work to repeal legislation targeting transgender and other LGBTQ people.Like their counterparts  in the South  and elsewhere, advocates in Louisiana will also look to courts for guidance and to keep legislation from taking effect.Five transgender youths and their families filed a lawsuit this year against the state’s ban on gender-affirming medical care, as reported by  The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate . The suit is pending in Orleans Parish Civil Court.“Nothing is off the table,” Guidry said. “If we cannot protect our students, we will continue to work, and if that includes litigation, we will take those steps when we need to.”For more from NBC Out,  sign up for our weekly newsletter .",2024-04-24 01:16:00 AM EEST,NBC,Transgender Louisianans say they’ve lost an ally in the governor’s seat,https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/transgender-louisianans-say-ve-lost-ally-governors-seat-rcna149082
"Daryna Mayer,Yuliya Talmazan","KYIV, Ukraine —  Ukraine  needed this.After months of  political wrangling  and  battlefield reversals , Kyiv has reason to cheer. Now the race is on to ensure that  U.S. military aid  gets to the front lines in time to make a difference to troops trying to ward off the advancing Russian army.For many in Ukraine, the news that the aid package had finally passed Congress offered relief and renewed hope of victory, with  the war now in its third year . But in the streets and trenches of Ukraine, those who spoke with NBC News espoused a view shared by many Western military analysts: that much damage had already been done and that, while important and welcome, the $60 billion of supplies would only go so far in resolving Ukraine’s problems.The aid is coming at a “vital moment” for the U.S. ally, which faces  severe ammunition and personnel shortages  that have left it in a desperate situation on the front lines over the last few months, said Neil Melvin, the director of international security studies at the Royal United Services Institute, or RUSI, a London-based think tank.“Russia is gradually grinding down Ukrainian men and weapons,” Melvin told NBC News. “The U.S. supplies can slow this process and potentially blunt an expected Russian counter-offensive over the summer, but Ukraine will need much more if it is to defeat Russia and reclaim its occupied territories.”<h2>'The key now is speed'</h2>In a call with  President Volodymyr Zelenskyy  on Monday, President Joe Biden promised that his administration would move quickly to meet Ukraine’s “urgent battlefield and air defense needs” as soon as the Senate passes the aid bill,  which it overwhelmingly did Tuesday  night.In fact, Biden is expected to announce a package that could be worth more than $1 billion as early as this week, two U.S. officials familiar with the planning told NBC News. The package is expected to include more equipment that the U.S. has already provided, including ammunition, High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems or HIMARS, stingers, highly sought-after 155-mm artillery rounds, infantry fighting vehicles, Humvees, javelins and other military equipment.""The key now is speed,"" Zelenskyy said Wednesday. He said earlier that he had also finalized agreements on the supplies of long-range guided missiles called ATACMS, which  Kyiv has long been seeking  as part of its bid to strike deep behind Russian lines.The news out of Washington has also been met with new promises from its European allies, with the U.K. announcing Tuesday its  largest-ever military aid package  for Ukraine.The renewed support comes ahead of an expected Russian offensive, which Zelenskyy himself has said could happen as early as this summer. Moscow’s forces have already been pushing in several directions in recent weeks, raising the specter of a possible attack on Ukraine’s second-largest city,  Kharkiv .Russia’s defense ministry said its troops  claimed  two villages in the eastern Donetsk region  in as many days  this week, as the Kremlin looks to exploit beleaguered Ukrainian defenses and make as many gains as possible before the new aid arrives.“If I were Gerasimov, I’d be pushing forwards as much as I could while there was a window of opportunity,” said Matthew Ford, associate professor in war studies at the Swedish Defence University in Stockholm, referring to Russian army chief  Valery Gerasimov .Bohdanivka, the village claimed by Russia on Sunday, lies just over 3 miles east of the town of  Chasiv Yar , a heavily fortified base for the Ukrainian army. Ukraine’s top commander  said last week  that Russian forces were aiming to capture the town by May 9, a symbolic date when Russia celebrates the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany.“Russia has the initiative on the battlefield. In the short term, that’s unlikely to be affected by the U.S. release of weapons to Ukraine,” Ford said. “Systems that help with air defense will help protect critical infrastructure. However, it is unlikely that land systems will challenge the current tempo of Russian activity as the summer fighting season starts.”<h2>'Six months of shuffling'</h2>In Ukraine, there was mixed opinion about the new aid and what difference it could make on the battlefield.“As long as Ukraine is continuing its fight, nothing is too late,” Dmytro Pletenchuk, the spokesman for Ukraine’s southern military command, told NBC News, adding that the show of support after months of uncertainty and arguments would help boost the morale of troops and civilians behind the front lines, because they know “the civilized world is behind us.”A Ukrainian drone pilot serving in the Kharkiv region also told NBC News that he welcomed the news, as drone units had been forced to cover for artillery units dealing with a severe shortage of shells. “We see this very positively,” said the soldier, who goes by the call-sign “Amida” and did not want his name used because he was not authorized to speak to the media. He said he hoped the supplies would start reaching the front lines by the time of the anticipated Russian offensive this summer, because it would determine where Ukraine’s troops can stop them.While grateful that a decision had finally been made in Congress, the soldier said the political infighting over the aid had left him with “an aftertaste” of disappointment. “The six months of shuffling, behind-the-scenes games, it was a sad sight,” he said.Some civilians in Kyiv expressed similar concerns about when the aid would arrive and in what amounts, as well as lack of clarity among the Ukrainian public about how much the country will ultimately have to pay for the desperately needed help.“It’s better than nothing,” said Georgiy Poliarush, 45. “War is a complicated thing in any case, but I think it will help. What will happen next and how much we will have to pay for it is a different question.”The Kremlin has rejected the notion that the newly approved U.S. aid will make any difference on the front lines. ""All these new arms supplies that are most probably ready to be dispatched will not change the dynamics at the war front,"" spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday.But while Washington’s aid package may not immediately transform the battlefield situation, it is an important development that weakens Russia, said Christopher Tuck, an expert in conflict and security at King’s College London.“We know that it won’t be transformational because Ukrainian forces were unable to achieve a decisive battlefield success last summer even though they had more aid than is being provided now,” Tuck said.But the congressional vote to approve the aid demonstrates politically that the U.S. is still behind Ukraine, Tuck said, because Russian hopes of ending the war on more favorable terms are pinned on the belief that the tide has turned in its favor not just on the battlefield but in the halls of power, too.“Replenishing Ukraine’s firepower is likely to increase Russian losses even further and this may help to slow, or halt, their advances,” he added.   “This is important because, for any kind of peace settlement to emerge, Russia first has to believe that continuing to fight will not improve their bargaining position.”Daryna Mayer reported from Kyiv, and Yuliya Talmazan from London.",2024-04-24 14:15:00 PM EEST,NBC,The race is on: Will U.S. aid arrive in time for Ukraine's fight to hold off Russia's army?,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/us-military-aid-ukraine-congress-fight-russia-army-putin-rcna148780

She called for peace ""from Pittsburgh to Palestine.""“Our movement is expansive enough and big enough for each and every one of us,” she said in a call out to those who opposed her during the primary. “We won’t be ashamed and put our heads down when we say that we want no more wars, when we say that people deserve dignity and human rights and self-determination whether they are Jewish or Muslim or Black or white or if they’re in Gaza or in Pakistan or in Haiti.”Following her defeat, Patel said in a statement that while the result was disappointing, the “race was far from a loss.”“This race was about so much more than me or my opponent,” she said. “It was about passing common sense laws that put money in working families’ pockets. It was about standing up to hate and stopping antisemitism. And it was about making sure President Biden gets reelected in November.”Lee, a member of the “Squad” in the House, has been critical of Israel’s handling of the war and was one of the first lawmakers to call for a cease-fire in Gaza last year. Patel painted Lee’s advocacy as harmful to Biden’s re-election chances and out of step with her district.The Pittsburgh-area 12th District is also home to Squirrel Hill, one of the nation’s most prominent historically Jewish neighborhoods and where the 2018 Tree of Life synagogue massacre, the worst antisemitic attack in U.S. history, took place.Lee, who condemned Hamas and has spoken out against antisemitism, has accused the Israeli government of committing “war crimes” and called for an end to unconditional military aid to the country. On Saturday, she joined 36 Democrats and 21 Republicans in voting against an aid package to Israel, which passed overwhelmingly. Jewish leaders in Pittsburgh have expressed unease with how she has handled and discussed issues pertaining to Israel.But Lee was seen as a prohibitive favorite ahead of Tuesday. The first Black woman ever elected to Congress from Pennsylvania, Lee overcame significant spending from pro-Israel groups during her first primary bid in 2022 before winning the general election. Those same groups did not get involved in her race this time around, even as Israel became a much more salient issue, seeing the effort to topple her as a steep climb. Well-defined in the district, Lee framed her race around fighting Donald Trump-aligned Republicans, bringing federal dollars to the district and bringing new voters into the Democratic fold.“It’s a testament to her strength that she’s in a good position,” Nick Gavio, a progressive strategist with the Working Families Party, which spent $320,000 in digital and TV ads on Lee’s behalf.Meanwhile,  about a dozen Jewish voters  in the district who spoke with NBC News almost universally said their votes in November, regardless of if they were backing Lee or Patel, would be driven by issues beyond Israel, saying that the Jewish electorate isn’t a “monolith” and that democracy, abortion rights and the economy weighed heavily on them. Most said they would be voting for President Joe Biden.At an event launching her “Jews for Summer” coalition earlier this month, Lee framed her primary as a covert Republican effort to divide a multiethnic, cross-religious support base by using splits over Israel. Even though groups aligned with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee did not get involved in the race, an outside group largely funded by GOP megadonor Jeffrey Yass spent more than $500,000 to boost Patel — a fact Lee and allies hammered home in the closing days of the contest.“We have communities that are hurting. The Jewish community is one of them. And there are people who are … not going to agree 100% on everything that you say,” Lee said in an interview with NBC News, adding she has been “very clear and very upfront” about her cease-fire position. “I have condemned Hamas. We’ve worked with the families of hostages; we’ve done everything that I think is necessary to do that. And at the end of the day, we disagree.”Patel, who denounced Yass and said the attacks over the donation were a distraction, framed her challenge to Lee around who offers Biden the most support. She criticized Lee for not denouncing activists and groups calling for Democratic primary voters to vote “uncommitted” in the presidential primary. “It’s essentially playing with fire,” Patel said in an interview, arguing it could boost Trump.Lee said she voted for Biden on Tuesday and at her “Jews for Summer” event earlier this month said: “We’re going to make sure that the person who’s sitting in the White House is not going to be replaced.” At a Pittsburgh campaign stop last week, Biden shouted out Lee as someone “who had my back.”On voters casting uncommitted ballots, Lee told NBC News: “I totally respect that.”",2024-04-24 04:12:00 AM EEST,NBC,Rep.

Dasha Burns,"Former President Donald Trump spent last week stuck in New York City for the beginning of his hush money trial. But on Wednesday, between days in court, Trump made time to call into a secretive donor meeting back at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, according to two people involved with the group who were in the room.The event was hosted by the Rockbridge Network, an under-the-radar, new-age conservative group that sees itself as the leading edge of a changing Republican Party — and is putting tens of millions of dollars into building a fresh infrastructure to support it. Trump spoke to a room of about 250 attendees who lean more tech-populist than traditional, 20th-century right or left, having gravitated to the former president and the way he has shaken up the Republican Party. Trump was originally slated to be a guest speaker but was unable to attend in person due to his New York trial. Donald Trump Jr. ended up pinch-hitting for his father as one of the star in-person speakers, according to the two people in attendance. Trump’s co-campaign managers, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, attended as well. The Trump campaign did not respond to questions about the event.Rockbridge isn’t yet a brand name in Republican politics, in part because the group has been secretive since its founding in 2019. The exact number of dollars behind the group is also difficult to verify, but one of the sources in attendance last week who is familiar with the group’s operations told NBC News it is in the “high tens of millions.” And while some older GOP donor groups eschew Trump — the Koch network, for example, is staying out of the presidential race after endorsing Nikki Haley in the Republican primary, preferring now to focus down the ballot — Rockbridge is firmly aligned with Trump.Rockbridge sees itself as a sort of anti-Koch network that can fill in the gaps the party hasn’t traditionally invested in. As the GOP went from middle- and upper-middle-class to more middle- and working-class, Rockbridge founders felt the GOP infrastructure didn’t shift to support and capitalize on that, the same source noted. While Democrats had labor unions organizing their blue-collar base, for example, Republicans didn’t have a mechanism to do the same.The organization is the brainchild of Ohio Sen. JD Vance (before he was a senator) and Chris Buskirk, who is a co-founder of the conservative fund 1789 Capital and the publisher of the website “American Greatness,” a pro-Trump outlet that describes itself as “the leading voice of the next generation of American Conservatism.” Billionaire Peter Thiel has been among those involved.“All these other historical think tanks and more traditional conservative organizations didn’t capture the Trump movement at all and didn’t recognize the shift. Many are still operating like they’re in the 1990s,” said Omeed Malik, an entrepreneur and donor who has been involved with Rockbridge since 2022. Last week’s three-day gathering, which took place at the Palm Beach Four Seasons apart from the Wednesday night Mar-a-Lago event, featured both new- and old-school GOP donor stalwarts. Among the crowd was major GOP donor Rebekah Mercer, billionaire and former Trump ambassador to the United Kingdom Woody Johnson, and prominent conservative lawyer Leonard Leo, according to the two people present at the gathering. Also there were cryptocurrency luminary Erik Voorhees and former Uber exec Emil Michael. Rockbridge’s membership includes a number of people from the tech world and elsewhere who may not have given political contributions before, as well as more traditional donors on the right looking for new ways to invest their political money.It’s not the first time Rockbridge has gathered at Mar-a-Lago. The group’s past events include a 2022 gathering at Trump’s club,  The New York Times reported  in a story detailing some of the network’s early plans.One of Rockbridge’s big 2024 projects is voter registration. The group registered 125,000 voters in 2023 and is hoping to double that in 2024, according to the source at last week’s gathering who is familiar with Rockbridge’s operations. The organization is funding a program to target new registrants based on issues important to them and an “ambassador” outreach structure that sees ten new voters each assigned to one organizer who gets to know them.New voters could be especially important to Trump in 2024 — the latest NBC News poll shows that Trump leads by a healthy margin among respondents who did not vote in 2020 or 2022. The question is whether those people will sign up and turn out. That’s where Rockbridge is hoping to come in. For people like Malik, the network also functions as an ideas exchange and generator. It was at a Rockbridge event in 2022 that the idea for Malik’s fund 1789 Capital was hatched. It is now behind Tucker Carlson’s new media venture, with the fund  leading financing for the former Fox News host’s latest venture .Rockbridge’s standing in wider Republican circles is still murky. “Their name pops up at times, but it’s very unclear what their plan is for this cycle,” said one Republican operative who works with donors.What is clear is that the network has the attention of Trump and his campaign — and it’s planning to play a big role in getting him elected again.",2024-04-24 04:12:00 AM EEST,NBC,Secretive conservative donor group meets to draw up 2024 plans — with a call-in from Trump,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/secretive-conservative-donor-group-meets-draw-2024-plans-call-trump-rcna148899
Zoë Richards,"Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is calling on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resign, adding another influential voice to Democratic criticism of  the Israeli leader .In an interview published Monday, Rep. Pelosi cited the  recent resignation  of the intelligence chief of the Israel Defense Forces over failures surrounding the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack, before pointing the finger back at Netanyahu.""We recognize Israel's right to protect itself. We reject the policy and the practice of Netanyahu — terrible. What could be worse than what he has done in response?"" Pelosi, D-Calif., told  Irish broadcaster  RTÉ's Six One News.""He should resign. He's ultimately responsible,"" she added.Asked whether she viewed Netanyahu as an obstacle to peace, Pelosi responded: ""I don't know whether he's afraid of peace, incapable of peace, or just doesn't want peace. But he has been an obstacle to the two-state solution.""The Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C., did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night.Pelosi gave the interview during a trip to Ireland, where she was named the inaugural recipient of the Fulbright Ireland Public Service Award.Earlier this month, Pelosi joined more than three dozen members of Congress who  signed a letter  urging President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken to “reconsider” a recent decision to authorize a new arms package transfer to Israel.The lawmakers had called for the U.S. to withhold future arms transfers until it completes a full  investigation  into the airstrike that killed seven World Central Kitchen humanitarian workers this month.More than  34,000 Palestinians  have been killed since the war began, according to local health officials. The Israeli government has said that about 1,200 people were killed in Israel during the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, with about 250 hostages taken, though it's unclear how many are still alive.Pelosi's remarks come after Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the highest-ranking Jewish official in the U.S.,  called for new elections  to replace the Israeli leader, saying on the Senate floor last month that “the Netanyahu coalition no longer fits the needs of Israel after Oct. 7.”The Senate  voted  Tuesday to pass the  $95 billion aid package  passed by the House on Saturday that includes $26 billion in aid to Israel and humanitarian relief in Gaza.

Lewis Kamb,"Facing yet another contentious  presidential election year , a federal bipartisan commission tasked with strengthening election security around the country quietly confirmed in January that its third executive director had departed the agency in as many years.Now, a recently released government watchdog’s investigation summary shows why.Steven M. Frid, the former executive director of the  U.S. Election Assistance Commission , was fired late last year after he gave himself a big pay raise and spent taxpayer money on Harvard University leadership classes without approval, an inspector general report found.“Frid improperly sought and acquired an increase in his own pay of $31,450 annually without the awareness of EAC Commissioners, who were his supervisors,” according to an inspector general’s  investigation summary , dated April 5 and made public Thursday.Frid, who until the time of his pay boost was receiving an annual salary of $172,100, was able to give himself the raise “by applying for and receiving `critical pay’ authority from the Office of Personnel Management” unbeknownst to his bosses, the summary states.The investigation also found that Frid enrolled in three Harvard leadership training courses last summer, at a cost of $28,300 to the agency, without first getting required approval from commissioners. Frid also failed to report 96 hours of vacation and other days off last year, the summary states.Frid, 41, did not immediately return a message from NBC News on Tuesday.A spokesperson for the EAC said late Tuesday afternoon she would forward a request for comment to commission officials, but the agency did not provide a statement about the investigation by close of business.Established in 2002 by the Help America Vote Act, prompted by the “hanging chad” controversy during the 2000 presidential election, the EAC provides funds and other assistance to state election offices to improve the administration and security of federal elections.The EAC is supervised by  four commissioners  nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, with former Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump each successfully nominating two commissioners who are still serving.The four commissioners supervise the agency’s executive director, who oversees a staff of 75 other full-time employees and an annual budget that’s $27.7 million this year. The agency has experienced heavy turnover among its top staff members in recent years.In  initial news reports  about Frid’s departure, the EAC didn’t explain why he had left the agency.According to the summary made public last week, the commissioners unanimously voted to fire Frid on Dec. 27 after the EAC’s inspector general informed them of the status of the investigation into allegations surrounding him. The findings, which did not turn up any evidence that Frid provided false statements when applying for approval to boost his own pay, were referred to the Justice Department, “which declined to pursue the matter,” the summary states.Frid, who had served less than a year in the top post, had previously worked for several federal agencies, including the Department of Education and Secret Service.According to his LinkedIn profile — which cites among Frid’s educational achievements an executive leadership certificate earned last year from Harvard — Frid’s job status as of Tuesday was listed as “#OPENTOWORK.”",2024-04-24 03:07:00 AM EEST,NBC,"Ousted federal election official gave himself a pay raise and misused funds for Harvard classes, watchdog says",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/ousted-federal-election-official-gave-pay-raise-misused-funds-harvard-rcna149090
Chuck Todd,"One of the memorable books I had to read in various political science courses in college was titled “It Seemed Like Nothing Happened” — a narrative-meets-textbook attempting to document the significant events of the 1970s.The title is exactly what made it memorable to me. I remember my smug, 20-year-old brain thinking, as I was buying the book for a class, “If it seemed like nothing happened, then why write an entire book about it?” Then, after realizing the substance of the book, there was another part of me that felt dissed, because of course the first decade I was alive was the decade the history geniuses decided was less meaningful! (There was actually a time in the ’90s, pre-9/11, when I and other colleagues of my generation lamented how relatively calm the world was during our lifetimes, which made what we were covering less consequential. With age comes wisdom, right?)Obviously, the title was meant to be a tad tongue in cheek. Compared to the ’40s (world war), ’50s (massive growth, Korea, McCarthyism) and especially the ’60s (assassinations, Civil Rights Movement, Vietnam, moon landing), the ’70s didn’t have the same cache to historians — yet.For whatever reason, the ’70s, even with some 50 years of reflection, still has that “it seemed like nothing happen” vibe to it when you look at the decade through the prism of the entire 20th century. Certainly, other decades, whether from the point of view of the world or the point of view of just America, were home to far more consequential events.But that decade’s comparative lack of world-shaking events doesn’t mean it lacked anything of consequence. And one of the more consequential aspects of the ’70s was the start of a notable trend of political disengagement. This was the decade in which voter turnout  started on a new downward trajectory . This was the decade where voters began showing their disgust for the system by  not  participating.Whether it was burnout from the activism and the wars of the ’40s, ’50s and ’60s, whether it was the economic malaise and sticky inflation that took hold in the ’70s, whether it was the perception that America was in retreat and losing its superpower status (see Saigon 1975) or whether it was cynicism born of government cover-ups in Watergate and Vietnam, there’s a clear line of disengagement from caring about politics beginning in the 1970s.In hindsight, considering all that was happening in the world and in this country, it’s a bit disconcerting that Americans looked at the laundry list of national and international problems and, instead of engaging more with democracy to change the leaders or the trajectory, simply shrugged and got less involved.I bring this up because of one of the more alarming results from our latest NBC News poll. We asked a question that we ask every election year — on a scale of 1-10, how interested are you in the upcoming election? And according to the results, we recorded the lowest level of interest in the election this decade. Fewer people picked “10” in this poll than in any presidential election year we’ve tested since 2004, with one brief exception early in 2012 that soon ticked back up.Of course,  as I’ve documented over the last few columns , it’s not surprising that so many voters have indicated disinterest in this election. The electorate desperately wants to change leaders, and yet both political parties offered up more of the same, so there’s logic to the electorate showing less interest in this election than it did in the first Joe Biden-Donald Trump matchup in 2020 or Trump’s race against Hillary Clinton in 2016.Ultimately, barring some event in the fall that resets the electorate’s mindset, it appears we are headed for a lower turnout election. That has its own consequences up and down the ballot, and it makes the third-party candidates — and the various idiosyncrasies of each battleground state — matter more than usual. When variance increases, so do the potential Electoral College outcomes.<h2></h2>Sticking with the ’70s theme here, another thing that stands out from the poll is how much it matters how you ask economic questions.We know the macro economy looks good, with low unemployment and an expanding GDP. But when voters were asked if this economy was working for them, that’s where they had some issues. Over 60% of voters say they are struggling to keep up with inflation.During the Barack Obama years, the health of the economy was judged by the unemployment rate — and when it was above 8% for parts of 2012, we were reminded that no president had ever won re-election with an unemployment rate of 8% or higher. By November 2012, the rate ticked a few tenths of a percentage point below that mark, and Obama won re-election.But these days, with an unemployment rate under 4%, the public is judging the health of the economy by the cost of goods and services. And when you look at it through the prism of cost, it’s really a very frustrating economy.Try being a first-time homebuyer, with mortgage rates over 7% — the highest in a generation. Not only has your buying power been diminished thanks to higher interest rates (a direct result of inflation, as the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates to combat inflation), but the higher interest rates have kept older homeowners from downsizing and selling their homes. Instead, older folks are keeping their lower-rate mortgages and not selling their current homes, shrinking the supply of available housing. So not only is it more expensive to borrow money for a house, it’s more expensive to buy any house because of the shrinking supply!The point is, there are plenty of real-life facts to support the voter perception that they are struggling to simply keep afloat.If this is a pocketbook election, I would not want to be Biden right now. When asking voters to judge Biden versus Trump on various issues and characteristics, one thing that jumps out is that voters, in general, view Trump as better able to handle the mechanics of the job more than Biden. Trump is seen as better on the border, better on the economy and better at handling a crisis (yes, even post-Covid).Biden leads Trump on various personal character qualities, as well as the ability to bring the country together. In some ways, if Trump wins, he’ll have successfully convinced swing voters that likability and empathy do not matter. He’s the Col. Jessup candidate: “You don’t want the truth because deep down in places you don’t talk about at parties, you want me on that wall — you  need  me on that wall,” the character from “A Few Good Men” says.We shall see — Jessup did end up being taken into custody. After all, as the prosecutor says, the witness has rights!Bottom line, this poll only reinforces the trends that I’ve been writing about these last few weeks.  This will be a late-deciding electorate , thanks to voters who have decided to tune out an election they believe they already understand without needing any new information. I truly believe that most polling between now and October will tell us very little. We know what 90% of the electorate is going to do — it’s the last 10% of “swing” voters who either swing between the two parties or swing between voting and not voting who will decide this election.And the lack of appeal of the top of the ticket, combined with the feeling among a number of voters that neither party has the answers on the economy or foreign policy, means Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  could become a very powerful “none of the above” factor  in deciding who exhausts their way to victory.<h2></h2>Forgive the nostalgia this week, but I’d also thought I would take a minute to remember someone who came to relevance in the ’70s: the late Florida senator and governor Bob Graham.I know the older we all get, the more we glorify the past, usually by forgetting the bad stuff and over-remembering the good stuff. But  Graham's passing last week  is a reminder that we really used to send fewer narcissists to Congress and fewer megalomaniacs to office.Graham won because he tried extra hard to represent as many Floridians as he could; he didn’t win elections by dividing Florida into red and blue camps, he won by trying to win 60% or more of the vote. I think we’ve always had two kinds of politicians. There are those who want to do whatever it takes to win, regardless of whether they are popular or not, with power mattering more than popularity — the just-win-50%-plus-1 candidates.The other type of politician wants as many people as possible to like them, and usually that drives them to do more of what the majority wants, not less. These are the folks who want a 60% approval rating at all times. What’s sad about eulogizing Graham right now is that his style of politics would not be rewarded in today’s political climate. He wasn’t a partisan at all — sure, he was a Democrat, but if you were a constituent of his growing up, you’d be forgiven if you forgot his party ID. Because first and foremost, Graham was a Floridian.What made Graham an extraordinary public servant was his focus on the ordinary. Born into wealth, Graham never acted like someone who thought his station was anything more than luck of the genetic draw. He was taught that he had to earn his place in society and, politically, that meant trying to walk in the shoes of his constituents — and I mean  literally  walk in their shoes. He became famous for show “workdays,” in which he’d spend a day at work with various Floridians. Some were teachers, some were cops, some were sanitation workers, some were farmers, but all of them mattered to Graham.Graham’s success as a swing-state Southern politician has many of us scratching our heads wondering how he never ended up on a national ticket. The most glaring “what if” from the 2000 election: What if Al Gore had selected Graham as his running mate? Would that have been enough to erase George W. Bush’s 537-vote margin in Florida, handing the presidency to Gore? We will never know.But let’s realize why Graham never ended up on a national ticket. The press and political intelligentsia of the Democratic Party thought Graham was too boring or quirky ( he loved his notebooks ) to be on a national ticket.The superficiality of our politics cost us a potential president or vice president who took public service, national security and U.S. intelligence very seriously and who thought the American government should be as idealistic in its actions as the public demanded.I’ll simply close with Graham’s words during a  presidential candidate interview in 2003 with The New York Times : “I have a reputation, that is not undeserved, as being more of an understated person, and I’m not easily aroused to fervent, some people would say charismatic, levels. But I think maybe what the American people want right now is someone who can give them a sense of steady leadership, as opposed to an emotional jolt.”Some day this will be true. Let’s hope it’s sooner rather than later.",2024-04-24 14:08:00 PM EEST,NBC,Chuck Todd: Will voters wake up by Election Day?,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/chuck-todd-will-voters-wake-election-day-rcna148951

"Sahil Kapur,Scott Wong,Allan Smith","WASHINGTON — Tucked inside the sprawling $95 billion national security package headed to President Joe Biden’s desk is a provision that could ban TikTok, with an important catch: It won’t happen before the 2024 election.That means TikTok, which boasts 170 million American users, will remain a force throughout the campaign, providing a platform for candidates to reach predominantly younger voters. An earlier version of the bill could have banned the popular video-sharing app prior to the election, but recent changes mean Congress and Biden may not face such an immediate voter backlash.The new  legislation  provides nine months for TikTok’s Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The president can grant a one-time extension of 90 days, bringing the timeline to sell to one year, if he certifies that there’s a path to divestiture and “significant progress” toward executing it.Even without the extension, the earliest a ban could start is January 2025. With the extension, it would be April. And with TikTok threatening legal action, the matter could get  tied up in the courts  for even longer. It’s a shift from an earlier House-passed bill that included a six-month window that could have triggered a TikTok ban before the November election.A senior Republican aide said Democrats were responsible for the change. “Senate Democrats had been pretty consistent about wanting to extend that timeline,” the aide said.The election was “definitely” something “conveniently addressed” by the new deadline, said a Democratic source close to the issue.Other Democrats are assuring voters that ByteDance would sooner sell TikTok than risk a U.S. ban, a view some  experts disagree with .“TikTok ain’t going away. There is no more capitalistic entity than an organization controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. They’re going to sell it,” said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., a member of the Armed Services Committee, who faces re-election this fall. “Young people will go on their TikTok tomorrow and they’ll still have it. And then the day after that, they’ll still have it. And the day after that, they’ll still have it,” Kaine said, adding that the only difference is it will be American-owned. “If you like it, you’re going to keep it.”In endorsing the revised TikTok bill, Senate Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., said that extending ByteDance’s divestment period — what she called her “recommendation” — would help ensure there is “enough time for a new buyer to get a deal done.”Other lawmakers who helped negotiate that change, including Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., agreed that the reason they pushed back the deadline was to improve the chances of a sale.“This gives more time to make the divestment achievable,” said Krishnamoorthi, the top Democrat on the special committee investigating the CCP. “It made a lot of sense. That’s why, as you could tell, we didn’t lose any votes because of the change. In fact, we gained some votes — we went from 352 to 360 votes in the House.”<h2>Trump, who tried his own ban, tells 'the young people' to blame Biden</h2>Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, sought to exploit a ban politically.“Just so everyone knows, especially the young people, Crooked Joe Biden is responsible for banning TikTok,” Trump  said  on social media. “He is the one pushing it to close … Young people, and lots of others, must remember this on November 5th, ELECTION DAY, when they vote!”It's a flip-flop for the former president, who signed an  executive order  in August 2020 to ban TikTok in 45 days if it was not sold. His statement cited “the threat posed” by China with its ability under Chinese law to force the app to grant access to Americans’ data and its potential to manipulate the algorithm to advance Chinese propaganda — the same reasons Congress and Biden favor a ban.But the executive order was blocked in court, and the app persisted.“I have every expectation that TikTok will be alive and well, no matter who is president,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. “Donald Trump is obviously trying to turn it into an election issue, but considering he was in favor of banning it, I think his warning is more baloney to use a polite word.”Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said opinions about TikTok and social media won’t “rival choice and democracy and immigration as a voting issue” in the 2024 election.But Murphy said the political implications cut both ways.“I am part of a group of pissed-off parents that feel that they’ve lost control of their kids’ lives. There’s undoubtedly another group of kids who are worried that they’re going to lose access to social media in the way that they have it now,” Murphy said. “But those are two very distinct voting groups and if you ignore the perils of social media, maybe you pick up some younger voters, but you lose some parents. So this is one of these issues where you have to see the full picture.”Rep. Summer Lee, D-Pa., who voted against the TikTok ban over the weekend, told NBC News in an interview that there is a need to solve the national security and data concerns associated with the platform but added that banning TikTok would be disastrous for creators, organizers and activists.“I think this is a case of throwing the baby out with the bathwater, where we have people, communities that are able to organize, that are able to meet, that are able to find space for their businesses to grow"" on TikTok, she said. “We need to actually think about what the consequences of that are, not political consequences alone. But the consequences holistically.”<h2>'The battle lines aren't really clear'</h2>A Republican working on Senate races said being tough on TikTok would have been an easier message to drive home in the campaign before Trump himself came out against the ban.“It used to be a lot more straightforward,” this person said of how they could message against Democrats who use TikTok to campaign — which, despite Biden's intention to sign the ban legislation,  includes  his  campaign . “But Trump is on the other side now. It makes the whole thing a little murkier. The battle lines aren’t really clear.”Still, the Republican believes that a looming ban could have a big impact on the campaign trail for Democrats who use TikTok, saying candidates are using it exclusively as a tool to reach voters.“It’s really clear they think it’s an important tool in their toolbox,” this person said.In frontline battleground Senate states, Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, and Bob Casey, of Pennsylvania, are active on the platform. So, too, are Democratic Reps. Ruben Gallego, of Arizona, and Colin Allred, of Texas, both running for Senate seats in competitive races this fall. Gallego and Allred voted for the TikTok ban in the House.Brown’s campaign declined to comment. Casey’s campaign said it could not comment ahead of the Senate vote. Campaigns for Gallego and Allred did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Biden's campaign said only that the campaign is on TikTok but that the president doesn't have an official account on the platform.Some of Biden's allies disagree with him on a TikTok prohibition.Progressive Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., a Biden campaign surrogate, said he opposes a TikTok ban, citing free speech rights.“The longer timeline helps marginally in pushing the ban until after the election and the bill, in any case, is likely to get struck down by the courts,” he said. “But rushing to pass it shows the complete disconnect between the Beltway establishment and many Americans.”Khanna's advice for election candidates navigating a voter backlash to a TikTok ban?“I would tell them to follow their heart but take their brain with them,” he said.",2024-04-24 12:00:00 PM EEST,NBC,Congress sends Biden a bill that could ban TikTok — after the 2024 election,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/congress-biden-bill-ban-tiktok-when-2024-election-rcna148792
Reuters,"Hawaiian surfer Gabriela Bryan shared a wave with a pod of dolphins as she won her first world championship tour event over Californian rookie Sawyer Lindblad in pumping surf at the Western Australia Margaret River Pro on Sunday.Margaret River local Jack Robinson took out a spectacular men’s final against Hawaii’s two-time world champion John John Florence in a replay of their 2022 final of the same event.Robinson and Florence were the two form surfers of the event and traded huge carves on the double-overhead walls as the waves finally improved on last day of the 11-day competition window.The decisive moment came midway through the final when Robinson scored an excellent 9.10 out of 10 for two giant turns on the biggest wave of the day and followed it up with a lofty frontside air on the very next wave for an 8.17.Florence kept battling and scored an excellent wave of his own but could not reel in the Western Australian, who finished with 17.27 out of 20 to Florence’s 16.04.“That was the final I wanted, I wanted to throw everything at it. It’s always fun surfing against John — we’re going to have many more heats together,” said Robinson, who missed the event last year due to injury.The world tour next heads to the thumping tubes of Teahupo’o in Tahiti, where both Robinson and Florence will be among the favourites battling for Olympic gold in just a few months time.Florence earlier scored the only perfect 10 of the event in his semi-final against Australian wildcard George Pittar, blowing his tail out and holding onto his board with the toenails of one foot before recovering for a couple more turns.Both Bryan, 22, and 18-year-old Lindblad had to go deep at Margaret River to avoid the mid-season cut and secure their place for the remainder of the 2024 tour.Lindblad went into the final in top form, having dispatched two-time world champion Tyler Wright in their semi-final to secure her place above the cut line.Bryan took a commanding lead with a 7.83 for two powerful turns on her forehand as a handful of dolphins swooped around her.“When I kicked out, I was just wow! That wave was sent to me by someone, the dolphins in it. It was magical,” said Bryan, who scored an even better 8.10 on her second scoring ride.“I’m just so happy we got good waves today and all the girls put on a really good show. It’s insane, I just won!”Both the men’s and women’s field will now be cut for the final four events of the world tour, with 11-time world champion  Kelly Slater  and Australian veteran Sally Fitzgibbons among those missing out.",2024-04-22 11:38:00 AM EEST,NBC,U.S. surfer accompanied by dolphins as she wins world championship event in Australia,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/us-surfer-accompanied-dolphins-wins-world-championship-event-australia-rcna148750
The Associated Press,"DENVER — LeBron James was seeing red after  the Los Angeles Lakers watched  a golden opportunity slip away.His frustration wasn’t so much centered on blowing a 20-point lead. Or his late missed 3-pointer that rimmed out with the game tied. Or Jamal Murray’s fadeaway buzzer-beater that gave the Denver Nuggets a 101-99 win over the Lakers in Game 2 of their first-round series Monday night.James’ anger was more distant — the NBA’s  replay center  in Secaucus, New Jersey. At the heart of his wrath was a second-half foul of Michael Porter Jr. that was overturned with the league saying MPJ had made only marginal contact on D’Angelo Russell.“I don’t understand what’s going on in the replay center, to be honest,” said James, whose team heads back to Los Angeles for Game 3 on Thursday facing a 2-0 deficit. “D-Lo clearly gets hit in the face on the drive. What the (expletive) do we have a replay center ... it doesn’t make sense. It makes no sense. It bothers me.”James wasn’t his usually expansive self in his postgame interview after the Lakers watched Murray and the Nuggets storm back from a 68-48 hole to capture their 10th straight win over the Lakers.James had a chance to give the Lakers a lead with around 16 seconds left on a wide open 3-pointer.“Rimmed out,” lamented James, who finished with 26 points and 12 assists.Porter grabbed the rebound, setting up Murray’s game-winner, a fadeaway jumper over Anthony Davis as time expired.James got right to the point after the game.— On Denver’s comeback, which included being outscored 32-20 in the fourth: “We missed shots. We still got great looks and we just missed them. And they made it.”— On Russell hitting seven 3s after going 1 for 9 from deep in the series opener: “We never lost confidence in him. D-Lo is D-Lo.”— On if the Lakers can take anything from this game into Game 3 in L.A.: “Every game is its own challenge.”— On the challenges after a heartbreaking loss: “Of course it’s a heartbreaking game and you don’t want to lose in that fashion.”That’s when James began voicing his frustration with the replay center. Earlier in the game, Murray was called for a foul when James drove to the basket, only to have the Nuggets successfully challenge for the foul to be waved off.In his replay-center rant, James referenced Monday’s earlier game, when the New York Knicks rallied in the final 30 seconds f  or a wild 104-101 victory  over the Philadelphia 76ers. The Knicks got the go-ahead 3-pointer from Donte DiVincenzo with 13 seconds left, a possession that started when they stole the ball from Tyrese Maxey. Joel Embiid said Maxey was fouled, and also that coach Nick Nurse and some players had attempted to call timeout before the Knicks got the ball.“What are we doing?” James said as he ended his postgame interview.",2024-04-23 10:51:00 AM EEST,NBC,"LeBron James rants at NBA's replay center for calls, Lakers lose on buzzer-beater, trail Denver 2-0",https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/lebron-james-rants-nbas-replay-center-calls-lakers-lose-buzzer-beater-rcna148911
Dareh Gregorian,"Former New York Rep.  George Santos  announced Tuesday that he was ending his independent campaign for a seat  in Congress .Santos, a Republican who was expelled from the House late last year, had said last month that he was running for New York’s First Congressional District as an independent.""I have decided to withdraw from my independent run for  #NY1 ,"" Santos said in a statement on X, adding he was concerned that his candidacy could split the vote with GOP Rep. Nick LaLota and deliver the seat to Democrats.LaLota is one of the Republicans who voted to  expel  Santos in December amid federal criminal charges. Santos has pleaded  not guilty  to fraud charges, and is scheduled to stand trial in September.Santos, who represented New York's 3rd District before he was removed from Congress, initially  declared  in March that he was running as a Republican, arguing that “New York hasn’t had a real conservative represent them since I left office arbitrarily, thanks to RINO, empty suits like [LaLota].”Two weeks later, he announced he was instead going to run as an independent. Santos said he was making the switch because the Republican-led House  voted to pass a $1.2 trillion spending bill  hours ahead of a government shutdown deadline, a move he called ""embarrassing.""On Tuesday, he posted, ""I don’t want to split the ticket and be responsible for handing the house"" to Democrats. He added, ""I'll be back.""Santos became only the sixth member of Congress to ever be expelled after a House  ethics report  concluded that there was “substantial evidence” that Santos “violated federal criminal laws.” It alleged that he spent campaign funds on luxury goods, Botox and OnlyFans payments. Santos has denied the allegations.Since leaving Congress, Santos has been active on social media and on the platform Cameo, where he is paid for short, personalized video messages. He  has also sued  late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, accusing him of fraud and copyright infringement for allegedly using fake names to request videos that Kimmel played on his show.",2024-04-24 01:22:00 AM EEST,NBC,Expelled former Rep.

Matt Lavietes,"A group of more than 400 current and former Olympic, professional and collegiate athletes, over 300 academics and roughly 100 advocacy groups released separate letters Tuesday urging the NCAA not to ban transgender women from competing in women’s college sports.The letters were coordinated by LGBTQ sports advocacy group Athlete Ally, and the signatories include former U.S. Women’s National Team soccer co-captain Megan Rapinoe, former WNBA and Olympic basketball star Sue Bird, and former NFL defensive end R.K. Russell. “We call on you to be on the right side of history and affirm that sport is truly for us all,” the  letter signed by the athletes  reads. “Do not ban transgender women from NCAA women’s sports.”In a separate statement from Rapinoe, arguably the most famous athlete to sign, the two-time Olympic medalist said “bans against trans athletes framed as ‘protecting women’s sports’ do not speak for us, and do nothing to protect us.”“The time is now for the NCAA and the nationwide athletic community to speak up and affirm that sports should be for everyone, including transgender athletes,” Rapinoe said in the statement, which was released by Athlete Ally. When asked about the letters, the NCAA said in a statement that “college sports are the premier stage for women’s sports in America and the NCAA will continue to promote Title IX, make unprecedented investments in women’s sports and ensure fair competition for all student-athletes in all NCAA championships.”The NCAA has permitted transgender women to compete on women’s sports teams under certain conditions  since 2010 . In 2022, the association announced that it would  implement a new sport-by-sport approach . The current guidelines, like the 2010 guidelines, require transgender women to undergo at least one year of testosterone suppression, but the new rules largely defer the specifics to the national governing body for each sport.The new rules set a  media firestorm that first brewed  over University of Pennsylvania transgender swimmer  Lia Thomas’  winning streak in the 2021-2022 season. Tuesday’s letters are part of a broader —  and highly divisive  — debate over transgender sports participation. A recent  report  from Gallup found that 69% of people say that transgender athletes should only be allowed to compete on sports teams that correspond with the sex they were assigned at birth.The NCAA, the largest college sports association with  nearly 1,100 member schools , has been a central figure in this debate.Last month, more than a dozen college swimmers and volleyball players  sued the NCAA , arguing that the sporting body violated their Title IX rights by allowing Thomas to compete at the national women’s swimming championships in 2022. Former University of Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines, who was one of the plaintiffs in last month’s lawsuit and was mentioned in two of the letters to the NCAA, tied with Thomas for fifth place in the women’s 200-yard freestyle race at a 2022 NCAA championship meet and has since become a vocal advocate against trans inclusion in women’s sports. When asked about the letters on Tuesday, Gaines denounced the NCAA's policies on trans athletes' participation, calling them ""discriminatory.""""Allowing even a single male athlete to compete in women’s sports takes numerous opportunities away from females,"" Gaines said in an email. ""The female athletes governed by NCAA policies do not accept this."" The letter cited Thomas’ wins and a decision earlier this month by a smaller sports governing body, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, or NAIA,  to prohibit trans women from participating in women’s sports  at its approximately  250 member colleges . “We urge the NCAA to reconsider its current policy that allows biological males to deprive women of a fair opportunity to compete and achieve athletic success,” the letter reads. “All women in NCAA-affiliated schools should not fear having their athletic accomplishments minimized by biological males.”Conservative lawmakers across the country have also gotten involved with the issue. Two dozen states across the country now have bans on transgender students participating in school sports that align with their gender identity, according to LGBTQ think tank  Movement Advancement Project . Injunctions are temporarily blocking some of these laws, including those in Arizona, Idaho and Utah, according to MAP.The Biden administration on Friday  issued a revised Title IX regulation , clarifying that the 1972 federal civil rights law prohibits anti-LGBTQ discrimination in schools. However, the new rule notably excluded a new policy forbidding schools from enacting blanket bans on transgender athletes, which, according to The Associated Press, the administration had initially planned to include.

"Sarah Fitzpatrick,Chelsea Damberg,David K. Li","The Justice Department agreed to pay more than $138 million to victims of disgraced sports physician Larry Nassar and apologized for the FBI's failing to act on warnings about the convicted sex abuser, officials said Tuesday.The ""FBI failed to conduct an adequate investigation of Nassar’s conduct,"" Acting Associate Attorney General Benjamin Mizer said in announcing the $138.7 million settlement.“For decades, Lawrence Nassar abused his position, betraying the trust of those under his care and medical supervision while skirting accountability,” Mizer said. “These allegations should have been taken seriously from the outset. While these settlements won’t undo the harm Nassar inflicted, our hope is that they will help give the victims of his crimes some of the critical support they need to continue healing.”It was reported last week that the Justice Department was  expected to pay around $100 million .The announcement is a culmination of several years of internal probes which concluded that FBI agents in Indianapolis made “ fundamental errors ” by failing to notify other FBI offices or state or local authorities about Nassar.A 2021 report by Inspector General Michael Horowitz blasted  Indianapolis-based agents, saying officials at that field office ""did not take responsibility for their failures"" and instead ""provided incomplete and inaccurate information to make it appear that they had been diligent in responding to the sexual abuse allegations.""The settlement came after two years of long and complex negotiations between Nassar's victims and the Justice Department, according to multiple sources familiar with the drawn-out talks.   ""It was a tough negotiation. I think they [DOJ] understood what happened and the gravity of it,"" one source told NBC News. ""There was a real acknowledgment by DOJ that something went very wrong here and they were reasonable in coming to an agreement.""Attorney John Manly, who represents more than two dozen of of Nassar's victims, said he's still waiting to hear from former  FBI director James Comey , who ran the bureau from 2013 to 2017.""The thing I think is very troubling here, despite numerous requests, the man running the FBI at the time, Jim Comey, has never explained what happened or how this occurred,"" said Manly, whose clients include Olympians McKayla Maroney and Aly Raisman.  Comey could not be immediately reached for comment on Tuesday afternoon.Funds have already been apportioned per claimant with the various amounts determined on a case-by-case basis, multiple sources familiar with negotiations told NBC News.   Those funds are expected to be dispersed within the next two months.“The survivors of Larry Nassar’s abuse were betrayed by the institutions they should have been able to trust. At a time when these athletes were in grave need of help, the FBI indefensibly failed to do its job,” U.S. Sen Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said in statement.Grassley is a minority member of the  Senate Judiciary Committee . “Though the past can never be undone, today’s settlement is an important step to bringing about some justice for what these athletes have suffered,"" the lawmaker added. ""I once again commend the survivors for their bravery and poise, and for courageously speaking out about their experiences. Their steadfast fight for change has forged a better future for the athletes and young women who follow in their footsteps.”Tuesday's deal is the latest in a string of civil settlements acknowledging institutional failures when victims first raised red flags about Nassar.Michigan State University, where Nassar worked,  agreed to pay $500 million  in 2018 to women and girls who were assaulted by him.USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee  reached a $380 million deal  with victims in 2021.The settlement announced Tuesday will resolve 139 claims made against the FBI, according to the DOJ.Attorneys Megan Bonanni and Michael Pitt, who represent 77 of those 139 claimants, said the settlement will hold ""the DOJ and FBI accountable for their failures."" ""The FBI fundamentally failed to protect hundreds of women and girls from sexual abuse through inaction and total mishandling of their Larry Nassar investigation,"" the attorneys said in a statement. ""We hope this serves as a lesson for federal law enforcement and they make the changes necessary to prevent anything like this from happening again.""The 60-year-old Nassar is serving time at the United States Penitentiary, Lewisburg, where his listed release date is Jan. 30, 2068. It's unlikely the disgraced doctor will ever walk free.More than 265 patients have said Nassar victimized them, including USA Gymnastics  national team stars Maroney ,  Raisman ,  Gabby Douglas ,  Sabrina Vega ,  Ashton Locklear ,  Kyla Ross ,  Simone Biles  and  Alyssa Baumann .",2024-04-23 19:58:00 PM EEST,NBC,Larry Nassar's victims reach $138.7 million settlement over botched FBI probe,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/larry-nassars-victims-reach-1387-million-settlement-botched-fbi-probe-rcna148990

"Keir Simmons,Alex Holmes","PARIS — Meandering down   the  Seine  R iver , the light breeze, gentle current and the sun’s glistening rays weren’t the only things the three kayakers were hoping to catch on a warm spring day — they were also on the hunt for garbage. By attaching nylon stockings to the side of their kayaks, they scooped up even the smallest fragments of plastic, as well as the everyday detritus of life in the French capital that washes to the river’s surface every time it rains. The members of the Arc de Seine Kayak club then sent what they had collected to be tested for bacterial levels. “My kayak capsized this morning and I’m OK,” a laughing Paul Maakad told NBC News on Sunday, at the Pont de Sevres in central Paris. But while Maakad, 40, and his fellow boaters said they were not scared of getting into the river, with less than 100 days to go before the 2024  Paris Olympics , fears are growing that events like the marathon swim, the triathlon and the paratriathlon could be postponed or canceled because of high pollution levels, or that the flotilla-based opening ceremony could be affected.Earlier this month, Tony Estanguet, the president of the Paris Organizing Committee, expressed confidence ""that it will be possible to use the Seine,” but admitted that the swimming leg of the triathlon could be canceled if pollution levels are too high.  ""It’s what we want to avoid, of course,” he said . His comments came days after  a French charity warned  that bacteria, including “pollution of fecal origin,” was far higher in the river than permitted. As part of an ambitious plan to open up the Seine to public swimmers by 2025 — after being illegal for 100 years because of dangerously high pollution levels — France has spent 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) on altering and upgrading the city’s antiquated sewage system, which now includes a 13-million-gallon overflow tank called the Austerlitz Basin. But in August, the swim portion of the test marathon event was canceled because the river failed pollution tests.As the starting gun to the Games approaches, Fluidion, one of the companies the city of Paris contracted to monitor bacteria in the water,   exclusively shared its findings with NBC News. A sample of water collected by the Pont Alexander III bridge, in the city’s center, showed E. coli levels two-and-a-half times the level considered safe for swimming. But that in itself isn’t necessarily a concern for the Games themselves, according to  Dan Angelescu , the CEO of Fluidion, a tech company that develops water testing products. “In the summer when there is a lot of sunlight, when the water flow, river flow rate is really low, and when there is no rain for several weeks, let’s say two or three weeks without rain, you can actually reach really good water quality conditions,” he said in an interview this month.But he added that even a small rain event could make  E. coli  levels shoot up. “You may swim in very polluted water and nothing may happen to you, or you may swim and you may develop itches, or you may develop infections, or you may catch a strain of E. coli that may be pathogenic,"" he said. ""Those aren’t very common, but they exist, and that could get you really sick.” But he cautioned that exposure to other pathogens associated with the presence of E. coli could lead to contracting a norovirus, diarrhea “or you could get certain diseases that can really kill you.”In a bid to boost public confidence, French President  Emmanuel Macron  and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo have both promised to swim in the river to prove its cleanliness.Pierre-Antoine Molina, a director of public policy in Paris, said he would follow suit. In an interview Monday, he said that water pollution in the river “has been gradually improving.”   He added that the work to upgrade the city's sewage system had led to the modernization of wastewater treatment plants and an improvement in the network that separates wastewater and rainwater. “It’s an ancient city going back to Roman times, so inevitably that’s a big task,” he said, adding that a lot of buildings had been gone up after  World War II  “and the sewage system did not always cope.” Around 30 miles downstream   from Paris, Edouard Combette, 50, showed no fear as he plunged headfirst into the storied waterway, which has inspired artists like the impressionist painter Claude Monet.   “Life is good here,” he said after coming up for air, adding that he didn’t know whether the water was completely safe.  “Don’t drink the water. You can swim, but don’t drink,” he said. “I haven’t heard of anyone dying or getting sick.”",2024-04-21 11:59:00 AM EEST,NBC,Inside the Olympic effort to clean up the River Seine — and why it may be spoiled by a rainy day,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/olympic-effort-clean-river-seine-may-spoiled-rainy-day-rcna147966
The Associated Press,"Golden State guard Stephen Curry knew he was running out of chances to play in what would be  his first Olympics , so he and his wife Ayesha started planning many months ago about how to make the Paris Games work for their family.Their growing family, that is.Ayesha Curry revealed in March that she is pregnant with the couple’s fourth child and the baby is due in June. That’s not entirely by accident; the couple thought ahead with hopes of keeping the Olympic months of July and August clear — just in case.“We thought about it ahead of time, which was nice,” Curry said. “If the timing didn’t work at a certain month in the fall, we actually would have made a different decision knowing the Olympics were on the radar. So, thankfully, the Lord looked out for us and if everything goes to plan, I’ll be available this summer.”That is, indeed, the plan. Curry was one of the 12 names formally announced by USA Basketball on Wednesday as the initial roster for this year’s Paris Olympics. It’s entirely possible that the roster gets tweaked between now and the first practice in early July — injuries or long playoff runs could spark changes — but Curry has been planning to make his Olympic debut this summer for some time.“I wanted to play in the last two that I was eligible for,” Curry said, referring to the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games and the Tokyo Games that were delayed to 2021 because of the pandemic. “Watching guys that I’ve been competing against the last 10 years all have that experience win gold medals, watching three of my teammates (Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green) win gold medals, I knew I wanted to do that.”It would be logical to think that part of the recruitment pitch to Curry this time around was the fact that the Olympic team is coached by Steve Kerr, his coach with the Warriors.That wasn’t really the case. Curry had talks with Durant and LeBron James about teaming up — those talks sparked in part by the U.S. taking a less star-studded team to the World Cup at Manila last summer and finishing fourth — but Kerr wasn’t pushing his best player to play this year.“He wanted to do it,” Kerr said. “He’s excited. I think 2016 would have been the year that made the most sense. In 2020, there was the pandemic. But I’ve never had the discussion with him. Going to the Finals wears you down and we had gone in 2015 and 2016. Then 2021 comes around, there was the pandemic, but now, it makes perfect sense. It’s another box to check in his career.”There aren’t too many of those boxes unchecked. And this might really be the last one of any significance left.He’s the NBA’s all-time 3-point recordholder, a four-time NBA champion, 10-time All-Star, nine-time (and probably soon to be 10-time) All-NBA selection, a two-time scoring champion, a two-time MVP, a Finals MVP, an All-Star MVP and a member of the league’s 75th anniversary team. He even helped put together one of the more memorable moments in All-Star history this year,  when he faced off with WNBA star Sabrina Ionescu  — someone he simultaneously mentors and admires — in a 3-point contest.The legacy has long been secure. But a little extra gold wouldn’t hurt.“That’s the goal,” Curry said.Curry and the Warriors won 46 games this season but didn’t make the NBA playoffs, falling to Sacramento on Tuesday in an elimination game of the  Western Conference play-in tournament, 118-94.  So, the next time he’s slated to play for real is now July, when the Americans convene for training camp in Las Vegas. The U.S. opens Olympic play against Serbia on July 28.Curry has played with “USA” across his chest plenty of times before, going back 17 years. He was on the under-19 team that won gold at the 2007 Global Games and won silver in that year’s U19 world championships — “that burned,” Curry said, “because you hate losing at anything.”He hasn’t lost a game with the national team since — 18 games, 18 wins. The Americans went 9-0 on their way to gold at the 2010 world championship (now called the World Cup), then went 9-0 on the way to another gold at the World Cup in 2014.“I definitely wanted this experience,” Curry said of playing in an Olympics. “I think the timing is just right. I’m later in my career. This is probably the last opportunity I have to play.

The song has since become a staple for many Latino families, touching the hearts of one and all — young, old, working class, upper class, urban and rural.Regarded as “El Divo de Juárez,” Gabriel began his career in Mexico in the 1970s and rose to stardom in the 1990s.  He died in 2016 at age 66 .The iconic Mexican singing-songwriting superstar is known for his fierce and forceful delivery, making audiences want to sing every one of his songs from the top of their lungs, as well as his sweet voice effectively pulling at everyone's heartstrings.For many in LGBTQ communities , Gabriel's flashy onstage personality and exuberant sense of style helped break down social norms, strict gender roles and machismo.  Iván Gabriel Aguilera, the singer's son, said his father always wanted future generations to relate to his music.""He would always say that 'as long as the public, the people, keep singing my music, Juan Gabriel will never die,'"" Aguilera said in Spanish. ""It’s nice to see that is happening here.""""He’s going to be immortalized there in the Library of Congress,"" Aguilera added.As Gabriel was jumpstarting his career in Mexico in the 1970s, Lavoe  had established himself as one of the greatest salsa music performers in New York City, later becoming known by salsa lovers everywhere as one of the genre's greats. Released in 1978, ""El Cantante"" not only became Lavoe's signature song: It also became emblematic of the new era of salsa music being ushered in by Fania Records.Written and produced by fellow Fania Records alums and salsa icons Rubén Blades and Willie Colón, “El Cantante” narrates the livelihood, struggles and adversities singers face. It also describes how they must interact positively with the audience when oftentimes they are their only supporters.Born in Puerto Rico and raised in the mainland U.S., Lavoe worked as a singer and trombonist with fellow  Fania Records great Johnny Pacheco  and his orchestra. He joined forces with Colón in 1966, creating one of the most important salsa bands that helped reshape the Latin music industry at the time. One of their hits, “Mi Gente” (“My People”), written by Pacheco, is regarded today by many Latinos as an anthem of Hispanic pride.Lavoe died in 1993 at age 46.Both ""Amor Eterno"" and ""El Cantante"" are among the dozens of Latin songs nominated to be added to the registry by Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus as part of a larger effort to increase the recognition of Latino contributions to American history and culture.Every year for the past 18 years, the Library of Congress has selected 25 recordings for preservation at the National Recording Registry, with  works by Latino musicians  currently representing less than 5% of inducted titles, according to Castro's office.Castro has received hundreds of suggestions from the public for congressional nominations to the National Recording Registry over the past two years, submitting nearly 70 titles of Latin songs for consideration, including Gabriel’s “Amor Eterno” and Lavoe’s “El Cantante” as well as Irene Cara’s “Flashdance…What a Feeling” and Daddy Yankee’s “Gasolina,”  which were inducted last year .All of these songs have helped bring the number of titles on the registry to 650, representing a small portion of the national library’s vast recorded sound collection of nearly 4 million items, according to the Library of Congress.For more from NBC Latino,  sign up for our weekly newsletter .",2024-04-16 20:30:00 PM EEST,NBC,Hits by Latin music greats Juan Gabriel and Héctor Lavoe added to National Recording Registry,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/juan-gabriel-hector-lavoe-national-recording-registry-cantante-eterno-rcna147991
Kalhan Rosenblatt,"When Konrad Pawlikowski finished making his lighthearted horror game, he committed a cardinal sin of game development: He didn’t market it. But as an indie developer who makes games in his spare time, he didn’t think he needed to. Please Stop Crying, a first-person fatherhood simulator, was a passion project. He worked on it while he was juggling parenting his infant daughter and working his full-time job making interactive learning modules for an oil and gas company .  In March, after a month of having worked on the game, he uploaded it to the platform Steam, where he priced it at $2.99 per download. Much to his surprise, Please Stop Crying became a hit on a different platform: TikTok.For years, TikTok has been a go-to for music discovery — giving lesser-known artists a way to rise to stardom if their songs go viral. Now, some indie developers like Pawlikowski say the platform is having a similar impact in the gaming world by helping bolster smaller titles. “I definitely think TikTok has a lot of marketing potential for small indie developers,” Pawlikowski, 25, said. “As a game dev, it’s amazing when you see people playing and enjoying your game.”With TikTok’s live feature, which  launched in 2019 , content creators can livestream from the platform. Livestreaming has been a cornerstone of the gaming world for years on platforms like YouTube and Twitch, where people play games while simultaneously streaming them for their audiences.Indie games in particular are having a moment on TikTok Live, where some smaller streamers have said they’ve found success attracting new audiences with more off-the-radar titles. In recent months,   games like Fruit Mountain, developed by the Japanese gaming studio BeXide; That’s Not My Neighbor, developed by Nacho Sama; and Content Warning, developed by the Swedish studio Landfall Games, have become wildly popular among streamers on TikTok Live. Hashtags of the game titles have racked up millions of page views.   Sam Clark, known to his followers at @SammyC_TV, said he has seen more engagement streaming on TikTok than he has had on Twitch. “I think it can be attributed to these indie games,” he said. “They basically kind of helped me explode a little bit.”Clark said many of his 24,000 followers tune in specifically for his streams playing Fruit Mountain, a game that requires players to toss fruits on a plate and combine them with other fruits.It has proven to be one of the more popular indie games on the platform. As of   April 5, videos  including  the hashtag #FruitMountain had 87.9 million views. Videos with the  phrase  “Where to get Fruit Mountain” had 21.6 million views.TikTok has become an ideal place to popularize simple indie games because viewers can jump into a stream at any time without having to know a game’s backstory, Clark said. He also described the platform’s endless-scroll homepage as a unique benefit that distinguishes it from Twitch.In recent years, TikTok has made an effort to entice more gamers to come to its platform. In 2021, it  launched  The Game Room, an initiative to spotlight gamers who livestream on the platform. TikTok has also added things like  subscription perks , features reminiscent of Twitch. A spokesperson for TikTok didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Attention from streamers has helped game developers like Pawlikowski, who said he has already earned a few thousand dollars on Please Stop Crying.As the traditional gaming industry goes through a transitional period because of  mass layoffs  and underperforming better-known mainstream games, Pawlikowski said he anticipates indie games will have a moment in the spotlight. He hopes to see more “developers shift their focus.”“I think there’s a little bit of corporate greed, and nowadays, games are just seen as this, like, dollar signs where they just generate profit,” Pawlikowski said, adding, “I believe games are more about expression and art and just creating something that players would like to play.”",2024-04-17 16:00:00 PM EEST,NBC,TikTok Live is helping some indie games find a larger audience,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/video-games/tiktok-live-streamers-indie-games-finding-audience-rcna147629
The Associated Press,"The artist and curators representing Israel at this year’s Venice Biennale announced Tuesday they won’t open the Israeli pavilion exhibition until there is a  cease-fire in Gaza and an agreement to release hostages .Their decision was posted on a sign in the window of the Israeli national pavilion on the first day of media previews, just days before the Biennale contemporary art fair opens Saturday.Israel is among 88 national participants in the 60th Venice Biennale, which runs from April 20-Nov. 24. The exhibition in the Israeli national pavilion had been titled “Motherland” by artist Ruth Patir.There was no immediate comment from Biennale organizers.Even before the preview, thousands of artists, curators and critics had signed an open letter calling on the Biennale to exclude the Israeli national pavilion from this year’s show to protest Israel’s war in Gaza. Those opposed to Israel’s presence had also vowed to protest on-site.Italy’s culture minister had firmly backed Israel’s participation, and the fair was opening amid unusually heightened security.Written in English, the announcement Tuesday of Israel’s delayed opening read: “The artist and curators of the Israeli pavilion will open the exhibition when a ceasefire and hostage release agreement is reached.” Two Italian soldiers stood guard nearby.Adriano Pedrosa, the Brazilian curator of the main show at the Biennale, praised the gesture.“It’s a very courageous decision,” Pedrosa told The Associated Press. “I think it’s a very wise decision as well” because it is “very difficult to present a work in this particular context.”The national pavilions at Venice are independent of the main show, and each nation decides its own show, which may or may not play into the curator’s vision.Palestinian artists are participating in collateral events in Venice and three Palestinian artists’ works are to appear in Pedrosa’s main show, titled “Stranieri Ovunque — Foreigners Everywhere,” which has a preponderance of artists from the global south.Pedrosa, the artistic director of Brazil’s Sao Paulo Museum of Art, said one of the Palestinian artists, New York-based Khaled Jarrar, was not physically in Venice because he couldn’t get a visa.Geopolitics is no stranger to the Biennale. The festival discouraged, and then banned, South Africa’s participation during apartheid. Russian artists withdrew their participation in 2022 to protest the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine, and the Biennale said Russia did not request to participate in this year’s edition.The war in Gaza erupted after Hamas and Islamic Jihad carried out a cross-border attack on Oct. 7 that killed 1,200 people in Israel and kidnapped 250 others.Israel’s retaliatory offensive in Gaza has so far killed over 33,700 Palestinians, according to local health officials, causing widespread devastation. The United Nations has warned of imminent famine in northern Gaza.",2024-04-16 14:04:00 PM EEST,NBC,"Artist refuses to open Israeli pavilion at Venice Biennale until Gaza cease-fire, hostage release",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/venice-biennale-artist-israel-gaza-cease-fire-hostages-rcna147970
Greg Rosenstein,"The first round of the 2024 NFL Draft takes place Thursday at 8 p.m. in Detroit, a night that could alter the future of many franchises. The Chicago Bears, Washington Commanders and New England Patriots own the top three selections, and many speculate those picks going to quarterbacks, which has happened three other times, most recently in 2021. USC signal-caller Caleb Williams is all but certain to go No. 1, so the intrigue officially starts with Washington. Which quarterback will the new general manager, Adam Peters, take? That’s just one of the many storylines to watch on ABC, ESPN or the NFL Network.Is Williams guaranteed to go to Chicago?Nothing is guaranteed until NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell steps up to the podium and reads his name but, essentially, yes. Williams, the consensus top prospect, threw for 3,633 yards, 30 touchdowns and five interceptions last season. He won the Heisman Trophy as the best player in college football the prior year after taking the Trojans from four wins to an 11-win team. Williams threw for 4,075 yards, 37 touchdowns and only four interceptions over 13 games in 2022.He will join a retooled Chicago team that traded for six-time Pro Bowl receiver Keenan Allen and signed running back D’Andre Swift in free agency this offseason. Williams will also be able to throw the ball to rising stars in receiver D.J. Moore and tight end Cole Kmet.What will the Commanders do at No. 2?Like the Bears, the Commanders have been desperate for a franchise quarterback for more than three decades. There was a glimmer of hope with Robert Griffin III, the 2012 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year, but multiple injuries over the next seven seasons led to an early exit from the league. Will this  finally  be Washington’s chance to turn around the franchise?The Commanders have a new owner in Josh Harris and a new general manager in Peters, and both have been tight-lipped on whom they might select. But all signs point to either LSU quarterback Jayden Daniels or University of North Carolina quarterback Drake Maye.The 6-foot-4, 210-pound Daniels won the 2023 Heisman Trophy after one of the most electrifying seasons in college football history. He threw for 3,812 yards, 40 touchdowns and only four interceptions, while also adding 1,134 yards and 10 touchdowns on the ground. Maye, at 6-foot-4 and 230 pounds, boasts the prototypical size for the position and has drawn comparisons to Los Angeles Chargers signal-caller Justin Herbert. After being named 2022 ACC Player and Rookie of the Year as a sophomore, he threw for 3,608 yards, 24 touchdowns and nine interceptions as a junior.University of Michigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy, who led the  Wolverines to their first national title  since 1997, is also reportedly being considered.Patriots could look to trade downNew England is still looking to find a replacement for legendary quarterback Tom Brady, who left the franchise in 2019. Mac Jones, a first-round pick in 2021, looked promising as a rookie but saw production drop off over the last two seasons. He was dealt to the Jacksonville Jaguars this offseason. The Patriots signed Jacoby Brissett, though he’s not expected to be the long-term starter. Will they instead take whoever is left among  Daniels, Maye and McCarthy? If not, a trade down with a team such as the New York Giants, Minnesota Vikings or Las Vegas Raiders could be in play. All are searching for a quarterback and would give up a multitude of picks to secure that. The Patriots, who finished 4-13 last season and has holes all over the roster, could use those extra picks to expedite a rebuild. Which wide receiver will go first? For much of the past year, Ohio State receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. has been the presumptive top wideout available. It’s still likely he is the first pass-catcher off the board, but LSU’s Malik Nabers and the University of Washington’s Rome Odunze have reportedly seen their stock rise enough this offseason to make it a competition. Harrison, the son of longtime Indianapolis Colts star receiver Marvin Harrison, is arguably the greatest receiver in Ohio State history. He won the Biletnikoff Award last season as the most outstanding receiver in college football after catching 67 passes for 1,211 yards and 14 touchdowns. Nabers will look to become the next star receiver from LSU, joining the likes of Justin Jefferson, Ja’Marr Chase and Odell Beckham Jr. The 6-foot, 199-pound Nabers catches everything in sight and will provide a team with instant playmaking ability. He hauled in 89 passes for 1,569 yards and 14 scores.Odunze, at 6-foot-3, 215 pounds, possesses elite size for the position. He set a program record with 1,640 receiving yards last season, the highest total in the country and the third-most ever in the Pac-12.Defensive players expected to waitGenerally speaking, this draft is known for elite offensive prospects. We could see five quarterbacks, six receivers and potentially double-digit offensive linemen picked in the first 32 selections. But let’s not forget about a few defensive studs. Pass rushers Dallas Turner (University of Alabama) and Jared Verse (Florida State) as well as defensive tackle Byron Murphy III (University of Texas) will all be in the mix to come off the board early. Sad night for Panthers fansThe Carolina Panthers finished last season with a league-worst 2-15 record. Top pick and quarterback Bryce Young struggled mightily as a rookie (though he didn’t have much to work with) and the team has many areas of concern. They should have the No. 1 pick in the draft for a chance to turn around the franchise, but alas … they have zero first-round selections. Carolina surrendered Moore, 2023 first- and second-round picks, a 2024 first-round pick and a 2025 second-round pick for the chance to take Young last year. If he doesn’t improve quickly, and that’s a big if, it will go down as one of the worst trades in NFL history. Panthers fans can probably just take Thursday night off. ",2024-04-24 14:00:00 PM EEST,NBC,"2024 NFL Draft: Top prospects, storylines to watch ahead of Thursday's first round",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/nfl-draft-2024-prospects-picks-teams-date-time-when-rcna148793

Angela Yang,"A comedian wrote a hit TV series about his real  experiences with being stalked . Now, he’s asking fans of the show to stop sleuthing themselves.""Baby Reindeer"" showrunner and star Richard Gadd previously told  Variety  that his show, which follows a character named Donny who gets stalked, is “emotionally 100% true."" But the fictional stalker character, Martha, is not meant to resemble her real-life counterpart. In fact, Gadd  told GQ  that the show went to “such great lengths to disguise [his stalker] to the point that I don’t think she would recognize herself.”Still, since the release of Netflix's ""Baby Reindeer"" earlier this month, fans have spread baseless theories online, attempting to correlate the  show’s depictions with real-life similarities.Viewers have been chasing after the real-life identity of Martha, as well as the character Darrien, a TV comedy writer who sexually assaults Gadd’s character. Fans online began to accuse Sean Foley, a British actor, writer and director, of being real-life Darrien, without any evidence.On Monday, Gadd posted a statement on his Instagram story asking fans to pull back on their unsubstantiated guesswork.“People I love, have worked with, and admire (including Sean Foley) are unfairly getting caught up in speculation,” Gadd wrote. “Please don’t speculate on who any of the real-life people could be. That’s not the point of our show.”Representatives for Gadd, Netflix and Foley did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. Gadd's Instagram story comes amid increased attention surrounding the show and fan impulse to "" armchair sleuth ."" Experts have previously told NBC News that the desire to sleuth, which has become commonplace on the internet, is a symptom of the internet’s obsession with true crime and its desire to engage in gossip. Gadd has said he’s not worried about his former stalker contacting him in the wake of the Netflix series, which he adapted from a one-man show he did at the 2019 Edinburgh Fringe Festival.“Due to where things ended in real life,” he told Variety, “it’s not a concern for me.”But this type of fan reaction can be problematic.On Monday, Foley posted a statement,  writing , ""Police have been informed and are investigating all defamatory abusive and threatening posts against me.""In his interview with Variety, Gadd said there's a reason why he couldn’t be too forthcoming with truthful details.“I mean there’s certain protections, you can’t just copy somebody else’s life and name and put it onto television,” he said. “And obviously, we were very aware that some characters in it are vulnerable people, so you don’t want to make their lives more difficult.

Arturo Conde,"Comedian, actor and activist Cheech Marin says he doesn’t let rules govern his life. But for his new role in “The Long Game,” an underdog sports movie about  five Mexican American teens who win the Texas high school golf championship in 1957 despite the racism they faced at the time , Marin found inspiration in the rules that guided his father.“When my dad came back from World War II, the whole world was the Navy because he knew exactly what to do in that world,” Marin said in an interview with NBC News, describing the rules that his father followed to get through life after the military.“When he came out of the service, he was bewildered because he wasn’t accepted in a lot of employable positions,” Marin said about his Mexican American father. “And he became a policeman, which was all rules. So he was safe in that environment.”    The movie ""The Long Game"" tells the real-life story of J.B. Peña (played by actor Jay Hernandez), a World War II veteran and school district superintendent who’s rejected from membership at the whites-only San Felipe Country Club in Del Rio, Texas, because he's Mexican American. He goes on, however, to form a high school golf team, the Mustangs, for the Mexican American teens who were caddies at the whites-only club and had fallen in love with the sport. The golf team  went on to win the high school championship .Marin plays Pollo, a World War I veteran who's a groundskeeper at the country club — where he, like Peña, could not have been a member because of his ethnicity.In the film also starring Dennis Quaid, viewers see Marin wearing a large cage over his head to protect himself from stray golf balls on the course. While the cage may look like a comedic prop, Marin said it symbolizes the “shell shock” or trauma that veterans like his father and other Mexican Americans carried as civilians once they came back.“I kind of based it on anybody who comes out of a World War or any kind of big war. They come out of that traumatized,” he said, reflecting on his character in the movie. “This cage that he wears is his armor against the outside world.”  In the movie, Pollo tells Peña that when he was serving in World War I, the military did not give him a gas mask in the trenches. But, Pollo tells Peña, you still have to ""play as it lies,"" a golf expression that means you have to play the ball wherever it falls — and deal with current realities.     “He has to deal with not only having had mustard gas, which really affects you, but how he fits into his own hometown,” Marin said, dissecting his character. “He’s now a stranger in his own hometown. So that kind of affects how he sees the world, how he hides from it and then, how he comes out every once in a while.”“The Long Game,” Marin said, is a story about being accepted. And the five Mexican American teens' victory is a symbol of earning that respect.“The first year they put a team together, they won the state championship at the course that they weren’t allowed to play on as players,” Marin said. “So you saw the change happening right then and there.”Off-screen, fans know Marin as a counterculture icon and half of the iconic comedic duo Cheech and Chong, along with his roles in movies such as “Up in Smoke” (1978) and “Born in East L.A.” (1987) and in the TV show “Nash Bridges,” among others.When asked to look back on the classic comedies and shows that helped make his career, Marin said there are many more Latino stories now than before.“You can’t turn on TV today without seeing a lot of Latino characters in every show that you watch. And maybe some of our biggest stars are Latinos, especially in music,” he said. “And so, we made a lot of progress, and there’s still progress to be made.”One area where Marin has pushed for greater acceptance and visibility is the arts: A big patron and collector, especially of Chicano art, Marin partnered in 2022 with the Riverside Art Museum and the city of Riverside in California to  create a permanent museum space for Chicano art . The museum has drawn praise for its focus on U.S. Latino art.Marin said that while Latinos are making breakthroughs as a community, Hispanics are not “really accepted into the mainstream” until they have their own museum.“One of the people I talked to in the museum world when we started [the museum space] said, ‘We’ll come back and check in with you in about 20 years, 'cause that’s the least amount of time that you have to put in order to be accepted as official,’” Marin said. “I’m going to stay alive just for that purpose.”For more from NBC Latino,  sign up for our weekly newsletter .",2024-04-17 19:44:00 PM EEST,NBC,Cheech Marin draws on the discrimination his WWII veteran dad experienced for his new movie role,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cheech-marin-draws-discrimination-wwii-veteran-dad-felt-role-movie-lon-rcna147932
Kalhan Rosenblatt,"A new song-guessing game is taking over the internet, one melody at a time.Bandle, which debuted  as an app in December , is seeing an explosion in popularity on platforms like  TikTok , Twitch and YouTube, where streamers and content creators are posting videos of themselves playing the game. Every day, the game, which is free, gives players information about one song, including the year it was released. The player then listens to the track, instrument by instrument, starting with drums. Players have the opportunity to guess the song at each layer, until they reach the vocals. If they still don’t guess it by then, they can get a text clue. Past songs have included everything from OutKast's ""Hey Ya!” to Whitney Houston’s “I Wanna Dance with Somebody.""Johann Levy, the game's creator who is based in France, said he was partially inspired by the success of the popular online puzzle game,  Wordle . In recent years, many game developers have capitalized on the success of Wordle by creating games with a similar format, including: Heardle, a different music-guessing game; Poeltl, a basketball player-guessing game; and Lewdle, a bad word-guessing game. In 2022, “there was a Wordle craze with the world,” Levy told NBC News in a phone interview. “And then Heardle, and I thought I could do something like that as well.”At first, Levy created a website to launch the game, which drew in up to 1,000 people at a time. But devoted gamers began requesting an easier way to play.  “Everybody’s asking me, ‘It’s a great game. I want to play all day. And how do I do that?’"" Levy said. ""… That’s how it became an app — just because people gave me the idea.""Levy said he used to use the program Garage Band and his iPad to recreate each layer of a track with the help of one collaborator. Now, he utilizes Logic Pro and templates. Some tracks can be completed in as little as 45 minutes, while others take as long as four hours. Since its app launch, the game has since built buzz authentically, thanks in large part to the streamers. Levy credited them for helping give the game an organic marketing boost.   “I haven’t done any [marketing] at all whatsoever,” Levy said. “I don’t have the budget for that anyway. It spread with word of mouth.”The game has a small  Reddit thread , where Levy responds to players' feedback and posts updates on game statistics.  On X , the Bandle Game account posts daily clues. For some streamers, playing Bandle has become part of their content repertoire. Anthony Fantano, a content creator and music reviewer, said he first heard about the game through some of his followers, who commented suggesting he give it a try.""Sometimes I’m pretty bad at sort of, like, instantly recalling song titles and stuff like that on the fly,"" said Fantano, who goes by “The Needle Drop” on YouTube, where he has 2.8 million subscribers, and “The Needle Tok” on TikTok, where he has 1.5 million followers. ""But, you know, it’s still a fun challenge.""Fantano said he enjoys seeing his followers react to the Bandle videos — even when he doesn't get the right answer. He's also enjoyed watching others online take part in it, such as the TikTok user ""Noodles.Music.Dailies""The user, who did not respond to NBC News' interview request, has become known for her videos which feature  her playing the game while cuddling a dachshund.In the last month, Levy said, seeing an influx of people playing his game has brought him joy, especially since he made the game in his spare time. His full-time job is in research and development, though he also plays the drums for fun.“I have this alert on Google for the keyword ‘Bandle’ and each time there’s a new video, from anyone really, I watch that,"" he said.

But in an interview with NBC News on Friday, Dustin Blocker, president of the Vinyl Records Manufacturing Association, said those issues have been resolved and that suppliers now have more than enough capacity to handle any orders coming their way, including massive ones like Swift's.<h2>Jack Antonoff is sharing BTS pics</h2>Jack Antonoff is giving Swifties what they want: more content.The Bleachers frontman, who is also Swift’s longtime collaborator and friend, shared pictures of Swift and collaborators on the album,  including Florence Welch .<h2>The acting U.S. secretary of labor has a question for Taylor</h2>Acting U.S. Labor Department Secretary Julie Su has a key question for Taylor Swift and her ""Tortured Poets Department"":""Is this department unionized?"" she  wrote in a post on X .Su, 55, has served as acting secretary since March 2023; she has faced stumbling blocks to being confirmed full time for the role  over her perceived pro-union bias .<h2>Destin celebrates Swift shoutout</h2>The city of Destin, Florida, is here for the Swiftie boost.Google searches  for the beach town shot up minutes after Swift’s “The Tortured Poets Department” was released.

They try to reinvent themselves, have a new identity, blend in.”It’s the same with heartbreak, she said.“I think when you go through a heartbreak, there’s a part of you that thinks, ‘I want a new name. I want a new life,’” she said.Or perhaps in Swift’s case — a new era?Read more at TODAY.com.<h2>The double album appeared to avoid leaks</h2>The standard edition of ""The Tortured Poets Department"" is  said to have been leaked  ahead the album's release. The origin of the apparent leaks is unclear, but none of the songs on the extended ""anthology"" version of the album seem to have been compromised.Leaks of major artists' work sometimes occur when physical copies of the album arrive prematurely at record stores or department stores, before the tracks are released on streaming platforms. Fans  suspect the surprise drop  of the double album was a factor in the 15 extra tracks avoiding leaks. The extra content was so unexpected that the lyrics of the anthology version have  yet to be uploaded to Spotify . <h2>‘The Tortured Poets Department’ broke a Spotify record in 12 hours</h2>""The Tortured Poets Department"" is already Spotify’s most-streamed album in a single day this year, edging out Beyoncé's ""Cowboy Carter"" in less than 12 hours, Spotify confirmed to NBC News.Swift currently holds the all-time record for most streams in a day by album and by artist for 2022's ""Midnights."" <h2>Who are The Blue Nile?

""Downtown Lights,"" released in 1989, was the peak of The Blue Nile's commercial success in the U.S., with the song reaching  No. 10  on the Billboard American Modern Rock Tracks chart. 1989 is also Swift's birth year and the title of her fifth studio album.Known for their avoidance of publicity, The Blue Nile has released just four albums since forming in 1981.<h2>Fans share their theories and joy on social media</h2>It wouldn't be a new Taylor Swift album without fans wondering who it's about or decoding the names mentioned in each song. (Who is  Cassandra , Taylor?)That speculation will surely continue, but now that the album is out, fans can't believe their luck. Reactions on social media praised the sonic and lyrical range of the album, saying that  ""everybody gets everything,""  whether you listen to Swift for her synth-pop hits or her intimate folk songs.Author and creator John Green couldn't wait to wake up his daughter to tell her she gets 31 new Taylor Swift songs today.<h2>By the numbers: Will Taylor Swift break her own album sales marks?</h2>“The Tortured Poets Department” blasted to No. 1 on the U.S. iTunes album sales chart following its release.

Read more in NBC News' article  here .<h2>Saturday is Record Store Day</h2>The release of ""The Tortured Poets Department"" will come just in time for a notable day in the music industry calendar: Record Store Day on April 20.

An anthology of new works that reflect events, opinions and sentiments from a fleeting and fatalistic moment in time — one that was both sensational and sorrowful in equal measure.""This period of the author’s life is now over, the chapter closed and boarded up. There is nothing to avenge, no scores to settle once wounds have healed. And upon further reflection, a good number of them turned out to be self-inflicted.""This writer is of the firm belief that our tears become holy in the form of ink on a page. Once we have spoken our saddest story, we can be free of it.""And then all that’s left behind is the tortured poetry.""<h2>To sleep or stream? Swifties question staying up even later</h2>Can you wait until the morning to listen to the 15 extra songs on Swift's anthology? If you answered no, you're not alone. Online, fans joked that they didn't expect to get this little shut eye.Among the fans: Gen Z Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla.""I got votes in the morning. Do I sleep or listen"" he  wrote .

That now makes it Swift's longest album, edging ahead of  ""Red (Taylor's Version)"" by just one track.<h2>A list of all 15 of the extra 'Anthology' songs</h2><h2>Surprise: a double album!</h2>""The Tortured Poets Department"" is a secret DOUBLE album.In a 2 a.m. ET surprise, Swift announced an extra 15 songs.""I’d written so much tortured poetry in the past 2 years and wanted to share it all with you, so here’s the second installment of TTPD: The Anthology,"" she  wrote on X . ""15 extra songs. And now the story isn’t mine anymore… it’s all yours.""<h2>It's 2 a.m.</h2>Now what, Taylor?<h2>ICYMI: Swift's powerhouse publicist Tree Paine gets profiled by WSJ</h2>Swift's longtime publicist, Tree Paine, whom many fans know by name, was the subject of a lengthy  Wall Street Journal article  published Thursday ahead of the new album's release. While she declined to be interviewed for the story, it delves into how she became one of the most powerful people in the entertainment industry since she joined Swift's camp in 2014. “There isn’t a publicist in NY, LA or Nashville that wouldn’t jump at an opportunity to work with someone as talented as Taylor Swift and her management team,” Paine said at the time,  according to the New York Post .Read the full story here.<h2>Couples are now wary of Swift's 'Lover' as a love song</h2>“Lover” — at least until recently — was widely received as one of Swift’s classic love songs. When the album of the same name came out in 2019, its title single was declared  first dance song material , or even a “ wedding waltz .”In the song, Swift paints a portrait of quiet intimacy. Her wild “Red” days, of thrilling romances with highs and lows and uncertainties in between, had settled into something steadier with one person, captured by a simple chorus: “You’re my, my, my, my lover.”But that interpretation is now in question, as Swift recasts some of her songs in a different light. Ahead of the release of “The Tortured Poets Department,”  she released five playlists on Apple Music , sorting old songs into groups inspired by the five stages of grief, or “heartbreak.”Read the full story here.  <h2>Aaron Dessner is credited as a songwriter on five of 16 tracks</h2>Dessner, who is a member of the bands The National and Big Red Machine, is one of two producers who worked on ""The Tortured Poets Department.""He's credited as a songwriter on five of the 16 tracks on the standard album. Dessner first collaborated with Swift on her eighth studio album, “Folklore,” for which he shared in the Grammy win for album of the year. He made several  guest appearances  with Swift on the U.S. leg of the Eras Tour, joining her onstage during the acoustic set for performances of songs they wrote together.<h2>Here's what some critics are saying in their reviews</h2>The critics have spoken. Here's a roundup of some of their takeaways on ""The Tortured Poets Department.""Billboard ’s Jason Lipshutz praised Swift’s boldness for releasing a “knowingly messy, wildly unguarded breakup album” at what’s arguably the peak of her career. It's more mature than her past heartbreak albums, he writes, and “not everyone will love it, but the ones who get it will adore it fiercely.”Variety ’s Chris Willman wrote that the album can serve as an “unapologetically dramatic” soundtrack to listeners’ own heartbreaks.Labeling it Swift’s most personal album yet,  Rolling Stone ’s Rob Sheffield described it as “the cathartic confession of a woman who thought she had adulthood — and adult romance — all figured out, only to find herself realizing she knows nothing.”And unlike on past albums, Swift doesn’t portray herself as a victim in this one, wrote the  Los Angeles Times ’ Mikael Wood. Instead, the album emanates “a proudly villainous energy as Swift embraces her messiest and most chaotic tendencies.”<h2>Jack Antonoff, Swift's longtime collaborator, posts love for album</h2>Antonoff, Swift’s longtime collaborator and friend, shared his love for the new album  on X .""Love this album more than I can say,"" wrote Antonoff, who worked on “The Tortured Poets Department” as a producer.Antonoff also co-wrote eight of the album's tracks.<h2>Swifties are starting to post reax on X</h2>In typical fashion after a Swift album drops, reactions from fans are pouring in online, and they TEND TO COME IN ALL CAPS. As any Swiftie will tell you, listening to new music from the artist always proves to be a collective emotional experience. <h2>Spotify appears to be holding it together (so far)</h2>The last time Swift debuted a brand-new album, Spotify crashed. No major issues so far this time around.Shoutout to the engineers and people behind the scenes who are probably working overtime to make sure Swifties don't panic.<h2>We have a new countdown</h2>Don’t go to bed yet! Taylor Swift’s Instagram page is displaying a new countdown to 2 a.m. ET. This wasn't on the timetable ...<h2>Swift releases statement after album drop</h2>In her first social media post after “The Tortured Poets Department” was released, Swift shared a statement about the album online.These songs reflect her experiences from a moment in time that was equally “sensational and sorrowful,” she wrote, adding that it is a chapter now closed.“Once we have spoken our saddest story, we can be free of it,” Swift wrote. “And then all that’s left behind is the tortured poetry.”<h2>Who is Clara Bow?</h2>The 16th and final track on the album is named for Clara Bow, one of the leading lights of Hollywood’s silent era. Bow, unlike a lot of stars from the 1920s, managed to successfully pivot to roles in talkies by the end of the decade. She co-starred in “Wings” (1927), which today is probably best known as the first movie to win the Oscar for best picture.I’m not a Swiftie, so I don’t have much insight into how Taylor’s music connects to Bow’s acting career — but I’m curious how this track will be interpreted by the die-hards.<h2>The album is here</h2>BRB, we’re busy listening with the rest of y’all. <h2>You can now choose a Swift-themed chat for your Instagram DMs</h2>Instagram users can now set their direct message conversations to a new chat theme inspired by “The Tortured Poets Department.”<h2>Bars, venues hold special Swift parties</h2>On the eve of Swift’s album drop, event venues across the country (and around the world) hosted release parties so Swifties could get their first listen of the “The Tortured Poets Department” on the dance floor.At Pianos in New York, music from across Swift’s discography will play until the new album drops at midnight. Attendees are encouraged to come in themed outfits and friendship bracelets, and the bar will be serving Swift-inspired cocktails.In Los Angeles, El Cid is hosting a listening party complete with fan-made merch, giveaways and a themed wall for photos. Attendees can also expect performances from drag queen Jade Jolie, who appeared in Swift’s “You Need to Calm Down” music video.Several Swiftie-themed events are also being held across the Washington, D.C., area, according to The Washington Post, which compiled a  list .<h2>A Swiftie mom and daughter are hosting their own album party</h2>Kristie Gilmore, 36, is ready to celebrate with her daughter, who was born shortly after Swift's “1989” album and has been a Swiftie ever since.Gilmore decorated her Boston-area apartment with balloons, signs and stickers in the color palette of “The Tortured Poets Department.” She sprinkled the table with handmade confetti of the album’s logo and made TTPD-themed “membership cards” for themselves and each of her daughter’s friends.“They’ve been counting down since Taylor announced this album,” Gilmore said, adding, “They’re just hanging out, having a dance party. They’re gonna try to stay up till midnight and listen to it.”<h2>What are the track lengths?</h2>The average track length on “The Tortured Poets Department” is 4 minutes and 4 seconds, making it the third longest album across Swift’s discography. The longest song is “But Daddy I Love Him,” which clocks in at 5 minutes and 40 seconds.“I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can)” is the shortest song, at 2 minutes and 36 seconds.<h2>Travis Kelce shared his early thoughts about the album</h2>Ahead of the Super Bowl, Swift's boyfriend, Travis Kelce, the star tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs,  weighed in  on the new album. “I have heard some of it, yes. It is unbelievable,”  Kelce said . “I can’t wait for her to shake up the world when it finally drops.”The  couple , who have  become the internet's favorite love story , were most recently spotted at  Coachella 's first weekend. <h2>Taylor Swift beat reporter speaks to NBC's Hallie Jackson</h2>USA Today’s  Taylor Swift reporter , Bryan West, spoke with NBC News about the album drop and all the Easter eggs being spotted by fans. <h2>Swift's music is back on TikTok despite UMG dispute</h2>Some songs that Swift fans know “All Too Well” returned to TikTok this month, months after they were removed.The songs were among the many tracks Universal Music Group pulled off TikTok after the label and the platform  failed to reach an agreement  this year. (UMG has no relationship to NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News.)UMG, known as one of the “Big Three” global music companies, cleared its music from TikTok in late January, saying it was doing so because of a lack of compensation for artists and songwriters. TikTok previously fired back at UMG, accusing the company of putting “their own greed above the interests of artists and songwriters.”Read the full story here.  <h2>The economics of 'The Tortured Poets Department'</h2>Die-hard Taylor Swift fans will be spending a pretty penny on her latest album release as she releases four variants of the album with one exclusive track each.Each variant of “The Tortured Poets Department” is named after the bonus song found at the end of the album: “The Manuscript,” “The Bolter,” “The Albatross” and “The Black Dog.” If a fan wanted to collect them all, the minimum for $13.99 CDs at a store would cost at least $55.96 before taxes.Longtime Swifties are already familiar with her tendency to provide deluxe editions, as anyone who was around for her original “1989” release can recall the Target exclusive that included three bonus tracks and three voice memos recorded by Swift. Her “Midnights” release included a Target exclusive track that was added to streaming only months later, and in May she released a new song on “Midnights (The Late Night Edition).” But this is the first time Swift has put an exclusive song on each individual variant, with no clear timeline for when they might be added to streaming. <h2>2024: The year of Post Malone and the pop girlies</h2>Fresh off of a collab with Beyoncé on ""LEVII'S JEANS"" from her now-famed ""Cowboy Carter,"" Post Malone finds himself on another major release of 2024: Swift's ""The Tortured Poets Department.""He joins Swift on the album's first song, ""Fortnight."" Swift announced that ""Fortnight"" would be the album's lead single and the song for which she is releasing a music video 8 o'clock tomorrow night. ""I’ve been such a huge fan of Post because of the writer he is, his musical experimentation and those melodies he creates that just stick in your head forever,"" Swift wrote on social media. ""I got to witness that magic come to life firsthand when we worked together on Fortnight.""While best known for more rap-focused songs, Post Malone is clearly making the rounds in the pop music scene, having also recently collaborated with Noah Kahan on ""Dial Drunk."" But his back-to-back appearances on arguably two of the biggest albums from pop artists this year raise the questions: Is Post Malone becoming a pop girlie? Is he just having a moment? Or is it all of the above?<h2>There's a book about Swift's impact headed to bookshelves</h2>Rolling Stone writer and music historian Rob Sheffield's book ""Heartbreak Is the National Anthem: How Taylor Swift Reinvented Pop Music"" will debut Nov. 12.He's expected to dive further into Swift’s music and fan connection.<h2>Swifties are celebrating with their own listening parties</h2>Many Swifties are sharing their elaborate party setups online as they prepare to celebrate the album release at home.Karen Rothdeutsch, 25, has decked out her bedroom in upstate New York with “The Tortured Poets Department”-themed decorations, complete with a platter of homemade cupcakes decorated to match Swift’s various vinyl variants.“I just made my space a little more immersive for my first listen,” Rothdeutsch told NBC News. “I’ll be sitting in my bed with a box of tissues and a notebook, writing down my thoughts and probably checking into Twitter every so often to see what everybody’s thinking about it.”She said she procured the decorations over the course of several weeks, but the whole setup cost her less than $100. While she decorates on a budget, she said she did splash out on the vinyl variants and collector’s edition CDs.<h2>Swift's new album is already breaking a Spotify record</h2>Spotify  said on X  that the “The Tortured Poets Department” became the most pre-saved album countdown page in the streaming service’s history.Since its launch on March 28, TTPD's  countdown page  has ticked down to the album’s drop, now just hours away.<h2>Was Swift's Grammys dress a  'Fortnight' Easter egg?</h2>The white gown Swift wore to the 2024 Grammys, where she announced ""The Tortured Poets Department,"" appears to have been an Easter egg. Swift appears to be wearing a very similar dress in the  teaser  for the ""Fortnight (feat. Post Malone)"" music video, which will debut 8 p.m. ET tomorrow.Swift was also pictured hugging Post Malone at the ceremony. Some fans online  pointed out a similar shot  of the two singers that appears in the teaser for the music video.<h2>Swift drops 'Fortnight' music video teaser</h2>Swift blessed fans with a teaser for “Fortnight (feat. Post Malone),""  the album's first single. ""At this hearing, I stand before my fellow members of The Tortured Poets Department with a summary of my findings. Album tonight. Fortnight music video tomorrow at 8pm et,"" Swift wrote in a  post on X , which was accompanied by a short video clip.The black-and-white teaser gave a sneak peak of the visuals for the music video. It's a combination of dramatic period gowns and a bleak medical setting in this supercut that is reminiscent of ""Poor Things,"" which Swift's longtime friend Emma Stone recently  won the best actress Oscar  for.Swift had announced she'd be dropping a music video at 8 p.m. ET tomorrow by sharing a “TTPD Timetable”  on her Instagram  page this week. <h2>Merch is here — and already selling out</h2>Hours before the album’s release, themed merchandise for “The Tortured Poets Department” is now  available to order  online.The merch drop includes hoodies, crewnecks and gold jewelry branded with the album’s logo. A display case for the album vinyls seemingly sold out within minutes.<h2>ICYMI: The Eras Tour concert film is on Disney+</h2>In case you need something to do as you count down to the new album, “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” is on Disney+. Swift  announced  the film would be available for streaming in February. The film features all songs from the three Los Angeles tour dates during which it was filmed at SoFi Stadium. They include “cardigan,” as well as four additional acoustic surprise songs from the tour: “I Can See You,” “Maroon,” “You Are in Love” and “Death by a Thousand Cuts.”<h2>Swifties online are freaking out over purported ‘leaks’</h2>The internet was at it again this week, with some online circulating what they said were leaks of Swift's new album. It is unclear from where and when the apparent leaks originated, but  one Reddit thread  is already filled with commentary. As early as Tuesday, ""taylor swift leak"" appeared to be blocked from searches on X. Instead, when a user tried to search the phrase, a blank page popped up with the message, ""Something went wrong. Try reloading."" <h2>The secret message has been decoded</h2>The sixth and final word of the secret message, “mortem,” was revealed today, hidden in the lyrics of the song “Begin Again.” The complete secret message is: “We hereby conduct this post mortem.”In a collaboration with Apple Music, Swift sorted some of her existing songs into  thematic playlists , along with audio messages from her. The messages seemed to confirm some fans’ theories that the playlists mirrored the five stages of grief — denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance — indicating that the new album may grapple with grief or loss. Swift later  used a song  from each playlist to reveal a hidden word on Apple Music every day leading up to the release of “The Tortured Poets Department.”<h2>Swift sets fans loose on an international puzzle</h2>Swifties had a big day yesterday after murals with QR codes were unveiled in cities around the world, including Mexico City, Paris and Chicago. Fans stumbled upon the murals, which Swift had not announced, and scanned them to find a link to a YouTube Shorts video. Every mural had a unique code that led to a different video, each revealing a new letter as part of a word puzzle. Fans came together online to help decode the puzzle, which seemed to hint at the new album's first track, because it spelled out ""for a fortnight.""<h2>Swifties in Los Angeles flock to Spotify pop-up library</h2>Many Los Angeles Swifties celebrated the new album with a pop-up library installation in partnership with Spotify. The three-day event, which runs through today at The Grove, featured a sneak peek at some of the album's lyrics.Fans posted videos of themselves lined up for hours to get a glimpse at the installation.A manuscript was front and center at the installation, revealing  new lyrics  periodically as the pages were turned over the course of three days. Many fans online tried to identify other  potential Easter eggs  in the pop-up library, such as a bust of a peace sign, quill and fountain pens and a globe that appeared to be pointing to Florida, the name of a track on the album.<h2>Why is the album called 'The Tortured Poets Department'?</h2>Fans were quick to note that “The Tortured Poets Department” is the longest title for a Taylor Swift album by a large margin, a distinction previously held by her third album, ""Speak Now."" Before ""TTPD,"" ""Speak Now"" was her only album title consisting of more than one word.Speculation surrounding the new album and its uncharacteristic title has primarily revolved around Swift’s  2023 breakup  with British actor Joe Alwyn after their six-year relationship.After the album announcement, a  2022 Variety interview  between Alwyn and Paul Mescal resurfaced on X. The pair revealed in the interview that they were both members of a WhatsApp group chat titled the Tortured Man Club, prompting some fans to  draw parallels  between Alwyn and Swift’s upcoming album.The true meaning of “The Tortured Poets Department” remains to be seen, but the album's rollout has featured references to famous poems like Charles Baudelaire’s “The Albatross,” among other literary references.<h2>Clues keep coming</h2>Speculation continues to grow over clues for lyrics, song titles and the album’s first music video.<h2>Not much from Miss Swift so far</h2>It's been a notably quiet rollout for ""The Tortured Poets Department."" No themed Instagram grid overhaul, no lead singles, not even a cryptic calendar leading Swifties on wild goose chases for potential Easter eggs. A week before the release, Taylor Swift was  rocking out at Coachella  instead of feeding her fans who are desperate for a hint of what's to come. Aside from a hand-painted QR code on the side of a building in Chicago, a planned exhibit at The Grove in Los Angeles in partnership with Spotify and a quick video released Tuesday that appears to leave the ""Midnights"" era in the dust as viewers tour The Tortured Poets Department, Swift has been silent on what we can expect.In the  video , posted to her Instagram account, we did get a glimpse of a schedule that only showed release day, and on it, the promise of a music video on Friday at 8 p.m. ET. Fourteen tick marks beneath led some to think the music video could be for the 14th track on the album, or for the leading song, ""Fortnight,"" since a fortnight is 14 days.Swifties believing in the latter theory proved to be correct. Swift announced that the music video would be for ""Fortnight"" in a Thursday afternoon social media post. Swifties online continue to grasp for any details to try to figure out what this mastermind might have in store for her beloved fan base.<h2>What songs are on the new album?</h2>Here's what songs are on the track list.Swift has also announced four bonus tracks: ""The Manuscript,"" “The Bolter,” “The Albatross” and “The Black Dog.” Each bonus track will be available on a separate vinyl variant and won't be on the streaming version of the album.<h2>When does 'The Tortured Poets Department' drop?</h2>Swift's 11th studio album, ""The Tortured Poets Department,"" will be released Friday at 12 a.m. ET, or 9 p.m. PT.It will be available for purchase on vinyl, on cassette, as a digital album and in CD form. It will also be on several streaming services, including Spotify and Apple Music. But if you plan to stream “The Tortured Poets Department” right after its release, be prepared for potential delays. When Swift’s most recent brand-new album, “Midnights,” was released, Spotify  briefly crashed  because of intense demand.",2024-04-19 22:29:00 PM EEST,NBC,Taylor Swift releases ‘The Tortured Poets Department’ double album ahead of Record Store Day: Highlights,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/live-blog/taylor-swift-album-tortured-poets-live-updates-rcna147489
Evan Bush,"In California’s boom-and-bust climate, Death Valley has offered some of the strangest scenes over the past few years. Some of the area’s perennial creosote bushes died back during a severe drought that hampered the region through 2022. Then torrential downpours — from the remnants of Hurricane Hilary and subsequent storms — revived annual wildflowers from seed over the last year. During the winter, extreme rainfall  resurrected an ancient lake  that is now disappearing once again.Together, these extremes have created bizarre juxtapositions in the famed desert.“I could take you to a field of dead creosote bushes with nice wildflowers springing up in between,” said Patrick Donnelly, a conservation biologist at the Center for Biological Diversity. “For a plant, it’s a post-apocalyptic wasteland — everything is dead — then spring comes and flowers are sprouting between the corpses.”Climate scientists have long predicted that global warming would both aggravate droughts in California’s inland deserts and also intensify bouts of rainfall. Death Valley locals say they’re watching that dynamic play out in real time. How desert plants, animals and local economies adapt to the changes in an environment that’s already one of the most extreme on Earth will determine the future of this symbol of resilience. “It’s interesting to have a front row seat,” Donnelly said. “This is the signature of climate chaos.” <h2>A 1-in-1,000-year storm — twice</h2>Susan Sorrells, who owns the ecotourism town of Shoshone, which is near Death Valley National Park, said the area’s weather is “always a roller coaster ride.” But that has been especially true over the last couple of years. In early 2022, Death Valley, like the rest of the American Southwest,  remained mired in the driest period since the year 800 . During the 22-year drought, soil moisture reached an all-time low. Plants were withering, including the creosote bush, which is known to live for thousands of years, thanks to deep roots that search for water and can survive on very little.Its dieback during drought, then, was evidence of the weather’s severity.“Desert shrubs are really tough and slow to die,” said Lynn Sweet, a research ecologist at the University of California Riverside. “But at some point, there is mortality.” Then, in August of that year, a deluge arrived. In several hours, Death Valley National Park received a record 1.7 inches of rain —  about three-quarters of its typical annual total . The 1-in-1,000 year storm, as weather forecasters would later call it, washed out park roads, moved boulders and trapped cars in debris. About a year later, remnants of Hurricane Hilary, a rare Pacific hurricane, dumped 2.2 inches of rain on the park —  exceeding its typical annual rainfall in one day  and setting a new 24-hour record.“To have the worst drought in recorded history and the most precipitation in history, it’s clearly climate whiplash,” Donnelly said. The rain closed the park, as well as Highway 127, which connects it to gateway communities but had become “a raging river,” Sorrells said.She operates an ecotourism business with a 20-bed inn, hiking trails, a trading post, an RV park and the Crowbar Cafe and Saloon. For Sorrells, the situation was dire, as the highway’s reconstruction was slated to last through the winter and into spring, making the area nearly impossible to access throughout its busy season.“We have a local joke: We make all our money from October through the end of April, and then we lose it from May through September,” she said. The community rallied together and pushed state leaders to speed up the project, Sorrells said. The park partially reopened in October, and the highway in January.Then things took a fascinating turn.Spring wildflowers, which germinated in the fall, survived a warm winter, when freezing temperatures would typically knock them back down, according to Donnelly. And in February, a multiday atmospheric river storm system brought another deluge. The wildflowers “lasted long enough for the atmospheric river to recharge them with all this rain,” Donnelly said. “Now, they’re growing in a very unusual way. They’re much taller than normal, much thicker-stemmed, very robust wildflowers.”There was also enough water to revive Lake Manly, an ancient lakebed usually filled with dust.For the first time, the National Park Service  announced in February that it would allow kayakers to paddle on the lake , which was as deep as 3 feet,  according to NASA . “People really came out for the sensational and fell in love with the beauty and charm and uniqueness of the desert,” Sorrells said. “We just started booming to the point we almost couldn’t keep up with the business.”<h2>Arid climate, flashy weather</h2>Most climate models expect California’s deserts to grow more arid over time, but also for infrequent storms to be more intense because a warmer atmosphere can hold more energy and water. “Flashier storms, longer droughts,” Sweet said. For some, the past few years have felt like a test drive of a new reality.Many desert species go dormant or hibernate during drought, which can make wet years look like a relative pageant of color and activity.The Mojave Desert tortoise, for example, weathers drought in underground burrows. Female tortoises can store sperm for years and save it for when the climate is just right to fertilize their eggs.Some hard-coated desert wildflower seeds can last for hundreds of years, until the right conditions emerge. “Death Valley is very extreme. You have to assume that plants and animals are adapted to the edges of what’s livable there. As it gets hotter, that gets to be more of a challenge,” Sweet said.Now, the rain is bringing renewal.  New shrubs are emerging, Sweet said, though they’ll need a “nice series of wet years” to survive. Wildflowers are feeding harvester ants, which feed lizards, which feed coyotes and other species. “We’re hoping the increase in resources makes its way up the food chain,” Sweet said. In a future that looks hotter and drier, she added, such respites will be essential: “Hopefully we’ll get these recovery periods of precipitation to refill the seed bank and energy reservoir of the whole ecosystem.” ",2024-04-20 14:00:00 PM EEST,NBC,"Tall flowers, dead shrubs, ephemeral lake: Death Valley has become a picture of climate whiplash",https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/death-valleys-wildflowers-lake-are-picture-climate-whiplash-rcna148241
"Michael Wayland, CNBC","The United Auto Workers said late Friday that Volkswagen employees in Chattanooga, Tennessee, have  overwhelmingly voted to join the union  — marking a major milestone for the labor organization and its first successful organizing drive of an automaker outside of  Detroit’s Big Three .Union organizing passed with 73% of the vote, or 2,628 workers, in support for the UAW, according to the National Labor Relations Board, which oversaw the election. A total of roughly 3,620, or about 84%, of the 4,326 eligible VW workers voted in the election, the NLRB said. Seven ballots were challenged and three were voided.“In a historic victory, an overwhelming majority of Volkswagen workers in Chattanooga, Tennessee, have voted to join the UAW,” the union  said in a release Friday night  before official results were released by the National Labor Relations Board, or NLRB. “While votes continue to be tallied, the outcome is clear: Volkswagen workers in Chattanooga are the first Southern autoworkers outside of the Big Three to win their union.”The NLRB still must certify the result, but barring any unexpected issues or challenges, the company is required to bargain in good faith with the union. The talks can be direct  or go first through a mediator.The sides have five business days to file objections to the election, according to the NLRB. If no objections are filed, the result will be certified.Volkswagen confirmed the UAW’s win in a release Friday night but offered little additional comment.“We will await certification of the results by the NLRB,”  the company said . “Volkswagen thanks its Chattanooga workers for voting in this election.”UAW leaders and supporters are expected to use the win as a launching point for the union’s unprecedented organizing  campaign of 13 automakers  in the U.S. following major contract wins last year with General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler parent Stellantis.President Joe Biden, who has heavily  supported organized labor and the UAW , congratulated the union on its “historic vote.”“Across the country, union members have logged major wins and large raises, including auto workers, actors, port workers, Teamsters, writers, warehouse and health care workers, and more. Together, these union wins have helped raise wages and demonstrate once again that the middle-class built America and that unions are still building and expanding the middle class for all workers,”  Biden said  in a statement.UAW President Shawn Fain and others saw this week’s vote as the union’s  best shot at organizing  the Volkswagen plant following the strikes and record contracts at the Detroit automakers. Those agreements included significant wage increase, reinstatement of cost-of-living adjustments and other benefits.The successful organizing drive comes days after six Republican governors of Southern states, including Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, released a joint statement  condemning the UAW’s push  to organize in their states.“We have worked tirelessly on behalf of our constituents to bring good-paying jobs to our states. These jobs have become part of the fabric of the automotive manufacturing industry. Unionization would certainly put our states’ jobs in jeopardy — in fact, in this year already, all of the UAW automakers have announced layoffs,”  the statement  said.The UAW previously failed to organize the Volkswagen plant in 2014 and 2019 as it faced greater outside political pressure and worker opposition. Workers rejected union membership by just 833 to 776 votes five years ago.The union will now set its sights on negotiating with VW. It will also look to an  anticipated organizing vote  of Mercedes-Benz workers at an SUV plant in Vance, Alabama.Workers at the facility earlier this month filed NLRB paperwork for a formal election to join the UAW. The vote for 5,200 workers will occur from May 13 through May 17, the NLRB announced Thursday.“The first thing you need to do to win is to believe that you can win,” Fain  told Mercedes-Benz workers  last month. “That this job can be better. That your life can be better. And that those things are worth fighting for. That is why we stand up. That’s why you’re here today. Because deep down, you believe it’s possible.”Fain previously vowed to move beyond the Big Three and expand to the  “Big Five or Big Six”  by the time its four-and-a-half-year contracts with the Detroit automakers expire in 2028.",2024-04-20 06:17:00 AM EEST,NBC,Volkswagen workers in Tennessee vote to join UAW in historic win for union,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/tennessee-volkswagen-workers-vote-join-uaw-historic-win-union-rcna148656
Variety,"Writers at  Sesame Workshop  reached a five-year agreement with the production company behind “Sesame Street,” averting the possibility of picket lines popping up in the show’s friendly neighborhood.The Writers Guild of America confirmed the deal late Friday. The group of 35 writers employed by the nonprofit organization voted unanimously to support a strike authorization vote last week.“We are so proud to work for an organization that values its writers, and we believe this new contract will positively impact writers throughout the children’s media landscape. ‘S’ truly is for Solidarity. We are glad to have a contract in place that allows Sesame to do what it does best — lead,” the  WGA ‘s Sesame Workshop Negotiating Committee said in a statement.The union sought to ensure that writing for the show’s animated segments and social media content would be covered by minimum rates. According to the guild, the deal includes those provisions. The deal also includes paid parental leave benefits, artificial intelligence provisions, and an improved residual in streaming.The contract was set to expire on Friday, and writers were set to begin picketing next week if an agreement had not been reached.Sesame Workshop lauded what it described as an “industry benchmark” of a deal.“We value our writers and their significant contributions to the creative process, which are integral to our ability to deliver on our nonprofit mission,” a Sesame Workshop spokeswoman said. “This agreement is a testament to our dedication to our creative talent, and we appreciate the WGA’s collaboration in working with us to establish this new industry benchmark.”Sesame Workshop is based in New York but scribes for the company are represented by both WGA West and WGA East. “Sesame Street” airs on the streamer Max as well as PBS.“Sesame Workshop writers won a new agreement that recognizes the value of the incredible work they do to educate and enlighten children around the world. This contract could not have been achieved without the solidarity and fortitude shown by the entire bargaining unit throughout the negotiations. Workers win when they stand together,” said WGA East president Lisa Takeuchi Cullen.",2024-04-20 19:28:00 PM EEST,NBC,"‘Sesame Street’ writers set new contract, avert strike",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/sesame-street-writers-set-new-contract-avert-strike-rcna148669
The Associated Press,"Tesla knocked $2,000 off the prices of three of its five models in the United States late Friday, another sign of the challenges facing the electric vehicle maker led by billionaire Elon Musk.The company cut the prices of the Model Y, a small SUV which is Tesla’s most popular model and the top-selling electric vehicle in the U.S., and also of the Models X and S, its older and more expensive models. Prices for the Model 3 sedan and the Cybertruck stayed the same.The cuts reduced the starting price for  a Model Y  to $42,990 and to $72,990 for a Model S and $77,990 for a Model X.The move came the day after Tesla’s stock tumbled  below $150 per share , eliminating all gains made over the past year. The  Austin, Texas , company’s stock price has dropped about 40% so far this year amid  falling sales  and increased competition. Discounted sticker prices are a way to try to entice more car buyers.Musk posted early Saturday on X, the social media platform known as Twitter before he  acquired and renamed it , that the cost of an entry-level Tesla was as low as $29,490 once  a federal tax credit  and gas savings were factored in.Industry analysts have been waiting for Tesla to introduce a small electric vehicle that would cost around $25,000, the Model 2. Media reports this month that Musk planned to scrap the project created more uncertainty over the company’s direction, although Musk called them untrue.The price cuts ended a long workweek at Tesla, which announced Monday that it was  cutting 10% of its staff globally , about 14,000 jobs. The company also said it was  recalling nearly 4,000  of its 2024 Cybertrucks after discovering the accelerator pedal can get stuck, potentially causing the vehicle to accelerate unintentionally and increase the risk of a crash.On Saturday, Musk confirmed he had postponed a planned weekend trip to India to meet with  Prime Minister Narendra Modi , citing “very heavy Tesla obligations.” He said on X that he looked forward to rescheduling the visit for later this year.Tesla is scheduled to announce its first-quarter earnings on Tuesday.The company reported earlier this month that its worldwide sales fell sharply from January through March as competition increased worldwide, electric vehicle sales growth slowed, and earlier price cuts failed to lure more buyers.It was Tesla’s first year-over-year quarterly sales decline in nearly four years.",2024-04-21 01:19:00 AM EEST,NBC,"Tesla cuts U.S. prices on its Model Y, S and X vehicles after a difficult week",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/tesla-cuts-us-prices-3-electric-vehicle-models-difficult-week-rcna148693

Rob Wile,"It will take some time for the Caitlin Clark effect to be felt across the WNBA.Clark enters the league as a budding superstar who is already widely recognized as having been the biggest figure in a sea change for women's basketball. Shortly after she helped the NCAA women's Final Four set broadcasting records, she went first overall in the WNBA draft, helping the event draw a bigger TV viewership than  the most recent MLB and NHL drafts . Tickets for the Indiana Fever, who drafted Clark last weekend, are the hottest in the sport.  Clark’s jersey has already sold out  — though Dick's Sporting Goods intends to sell Clark name and number T-shirts in all 724 of its locations, according to a company spokesperson. Last year, it sold WNBA merch in only a fraction of its stores. But even as women’s basketball surges broadly, Clark comes into a league that has faced steep financial shortcomings, leaving its players well short of being compensated at the levels of their male counterparts. “It’s not good enough,” Nancy Lieberman, a Hall of Fame basketball player, Olympic gold medalist and NCAA champion, said in an interview. “It has to get better.”It could take several years for all the crucial deals among players, the league, broadcast partners and other business interests to renegotiate the way money flows.Right now, WNBA players remain locked into the collective bargaining agreement, or CBA, they signed in 2020, which dictates their overall pay terms. Since the deal was signed, the revenue generated by the WNBA has grown — yet it still pales in comparison to those generated by the NBA.Last year,  a Bloomberg News report  found the WNBA was projected to make $180 million to $200 million for the 2023 season. A WNBA spokesperson declined to comment on the report, which NBC News hasn’t verified. The spokesperson also declined to discuss league financials. The WNBA's revenue compares with about $10 billion for the NBA in the season ending in 2022, the most recent year for which data is available.The WNBA’s lower revenue is a key reason for  the pay disparity between the leagues  that has now drawn national headlines, and it is why rookies, including Clark, will earn a base salary of just $76,000 this season.Of course, Clark will earn much more than that through outside sponsorship deals. And she is eligible for a suite of performance-based bonuses and marketing arrangements with her team, the Fever, and the league itself that are worth at least $500,000.   But that would still most likely be less than the NBA’s current league minimum of about $1 million. Technically, NBA rookies make slightly more than that. Players in the NBA’s lower-level G League are the exception; they typically earn a season salary of about $40,000.The gap between male and female basketball players isn’t only about the level of pay.  NBA players enjoy about a 50-50 split of so-called basketball-related revenues — like broadcast money and jersey sales — with owners.The CBA that WNBA players signed allowed for revenue sharing only if certain revenue thresholds were met. And so far, they’ve fallen short, a WNBA spokesperson confirmed. WNBA players can opt out of their CBA after this season — and it’s likely that they will, given the enormous growth the women’s game had been experiencing even before Clark captured America’s attention.The hope is that with Clark and other young stars entering the league, there will soon be more money and better terms for its players.In particular, the WNBA is poised to negotiate a new set of broadcasting rights that will increase the value of the league — enough to the point that the revenue sharing threshold would become moot, assuming the thresholds even remain.Ironically, the fate of the WNBA remains in the hands of the NBA, which controls more than 40% of the women's league. That's why Terri Carmichael Jackson, the Women’s National Basketball Players Association executive director, has called on the NBA to put the WNBA front and center.    ""It’s time the NBA recognizes the indispensable role of WNBA players in shaping the league’s future success,"" Carmichael Jackson said in a statement to NBC News. She continued: “They must acknowledge that valuing WNBA players and paying million-dollar salaries requires a stronger broadcast deal, one that absolutely necessitates players at the negotiating table to strengthen the business case and drive home their value.""Asked for comment, an NBA spokesperson referred NBC News to the WNBA.In a statement, WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said: “We continue to find ways to return some of the growth we have been experiencing to the players beyond what the CBA requires,"" referring to the collective bargaining agreement.We’re “increasing playoff bonuses by over 50% and providing a $4 million budgeted charter [flight] program for full playoffs, all back-to-backs requiring air travel, and the Commissioner Cup Championship Game,” Engelbert added.WNBA players aren’t necessarily asking to be paid at the same levels as their NBA counterparts. Rather, as Las Vegas Aces star Kelsey Plum said on an episode of the Vegas-centric “ The Residency Podcast ,” “We’re asking to get paid the same percentage of revenue shared.”Lieberman, the Hall of Famer, said there has been unwillingness to make the kinds of investments necessary to put the game front and center, on TV or elsewhere.""Being the first, it can be very lonely,"" she said, adding that, in many cases, her success had come from decision-makers — mostly men — who had ""taken a leap of faith.""Lieberman's comments echoed those of University of Connecticut women's coach Geno Auriemma, who was much more explicit in his criticism of the WNBA's growth efforts.“The WNBA is going to have to do a great job of marketing these guys,” he said at a news conference this month, referring to players like Clark and Huskies star Paige Bueckers. “And the WNBA I don’t think has done a great job of marketing their individual stars.”CORRECTION  (April 22, 2024, 9:54 a.m. ET) A previous version of this article misstated which Clark merchandise sold out at Dick’s Sporting Goods.

"Gabrielle Fonrouge, CNBC","Longtime mall retailer  Express  filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Monday, but a group of investors led by brand management firm WHP Global is looking to save the company by acquiring it. Express, whose portfolio includes its namesake banner, Bonobos and UpWest, said it will close 95 of its eponymous shops and all of its UpWest doors. Closing sales are expected to begin Tuesday. The company said hours for remaining stores won’t change and it will continue to accept orders and returns as usual.In a news release, Express said it filed for bankruptcy to “facilitate” a sale process of most of its retail stores and operations to the investor group, which includes WHP,  Simon Property Group  and Brookfield Properties. It received a nonbinding letter of intent from the investors to buy the assets, and has also secured $35 million in new financing from some of its existing lenders, subject to court approval. “The proposed transaction will provide Express with additional financial resources, better position the business for profitable growth and maximize value for the Company’s stakeholders,” Express said. Express also secured $49 million in cash from the IRS related to the CARES Act — a critical influx of liquidity that the company had been waiting on to shore up its balance sheet. “We continue to make meaningful progress refining our product assortments, driving demand, connecting with customers and strengthening our operations,” CEO Stewart Glendinning said in a statement. “We are taking an important step that will strengthen our financial position and enable Express to continue advancing our business initiatives,” he added.The business casual apparel brand, founded in 1980 by Les Wexner’s Limited Brands, has seen sales plummet over the last few years as debt and costly mall leases dragged down its business. Earlier this month, CNBC reported that Express was  struggling to pay its vendors  on time, indicating it was in financial distress and struggling to manage cash flows. When retailers can’t pay their vendors, suppliers sometimes tighten payment terms or refuse to fulfill orders, which can further pressure a company’s liquidity.Last spring, Express  acquired Bonobos’  operating assets and related liabilities for $25 million from  Walmart  in a joint deal with WHP. The deal came as Express’ “core business was weak, and cash was tight,” GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders said in a Monday note.Still, its biggest problem was declining revenue, which has fallen by about 10% since 2019, Saunders said. “This stands in marked contrast to an apparel sector that has grown strongly over the same period. This has put the company under a lot of financial strain and has resulted in some significant losses. None of this is sustainable which is one of the reasons for bankruptcy,” said Saunders.  “The woes at Express are not all of its own making,” he said. “The formal and smart casual market for both men and women has softened over recent years because of a rise from working from home and the casualization of fashion. This puts Express firmly on the wrong side of trends and, in our view, the chain made too little effort to adapt.”Bankruptcy will provide some key relief to Express and help it get back on stronger footing as it works to implement its turnaround strategy. It’ll allow the retailer to get out of costly and burdensome leases, many of which are in struggling malls, and has made the company more attractive to buyers. Powerhouse law firm Kirkland & Ellis, which led Bed Bath & Beyond and many other failed retailers through their bankruptcies, is serving as Express’ legal counsel. Moelis & Co. has been tapped as its investment banker and M3 Partners has signed on as its financial advisor.",2024-04-22 19:36:00 PM EEST,NBC,"Express files for bankruptcy, plans to close nearly 100 stores as investor group looks to save the brand",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/express-files-bankruptcy-plans-close-nearly-100-stores-investor-group-rcna148821
"Dan Mangan, CNBC","Former President  Donald Trump  is poised to receive an additional 36 million shares of  Trump Media  Tuesday — an “earnout” bonus worth more than $1.25 billion, at Monday’s price.Trump Media, which owns the  Truth Social  app, was trading at around $35 per share mid-day Monday.But that price is twice the $17.50 benchmark minimum share price, which the  DJT  ticker has to hit by the close of trading Tuesday, for Trump to become eligible for the extra so-called  earnout shares .That earnout is contingent on the benchmark being hit for 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period, beginning March 25. Tuesday is the 20th day and it is very unlikely that DJT will fall below the benchmark price by the end of that day.Trump Media’s share price was down about 1.8% as of 12:17 p.m. ETThe 36 million additional for Trump would be added to the 78.75 million shares he already owns, as the company’s majority shareholder.When the earnout shares are added to his existing stock, Trump’s total stake in Trump Media would be worth more than $4 billion on paper, at $35 a share.Trump Media has the power to issue a total of 40 million earnout shares, as part of the merger deal that combined it with a publicly traded shell company, Digital World Acquisition Corp.“Assuming the full issuance of the Earnout Shares, President Donald J. Trump will receive 36,000,000 Earnout Shares,” the company said in a securities filing. The filing suggests that some, if not all, of the remaining shares will be issued to Trump Media’s executive officers as part of an incentive plan.Trump was in a New York City courtroom Monday, listening to opening statements in his criminal hush money trial. Court resumes on Tuesday for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.The merged company, whose full name is Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., began public trading under the DJT ticker on March 26, at an opening price of $70.90 per share.That price rose to a high of nearly $80 that day, briefly giving the company a market capitalization of more than $9 billion. This was despite having reported a 2023 net loss of $58 million, and just $4.1 million in revenue.But since then, Trump Media’s share price has plunged. By the close of trading on April 15, the share price had fallen nearly 68% from its opening price.The stock price rose sharply last week. But as of Monday, Trump Media shares were still trading around 50% lower than the price they debuted at last month, erasing billions of dollars in market capitalization for the company.Even with a much lower stock price, Trump is almost certain to receive all of his earnout shares.That’s because the threshold share price at which Trump will receive all 36 million of his earnout shares was set at $17.50. The last time the stock traded at that price was in January, before the Securities and Exchange Commission greenlighted DWAC and Trump Media’s plans to merge.It remains to be seen if the issuance of the earnout shares to Trump will affect the share price of Trump Media.Any shares that Trump owns are subject to a lock-up provision that prevents him from selling them in the six months following the merger’s closing date.While Trump Media’s board could amend that provision, to date, it has not taken any steps to do so.CNBC asked a company spokeswoman about the expected triggering of Trump’s earnout shares.She replied, “With more than $200 million in the bank and zero debt, Trump Media is fulfilling all its obligations related to the merger and rapidly moving forward with its business plan.”",2024-04-22 21:34:00 PM EEST,NBC,Donald Trump set to receive $1.25 billion worth of Trump Media stock in DJT earnout bonus,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/donald-trump-set-receive-125-billion-trump-media-stock-djt-earnout-bon-rcna148847
"Mirna Alsharif,Austin Mullen","Comedian  Arj Barker  asked a breastfeeding mother and her baby to leave his comedy show at the Athenaeum Theatre in Melbourne, Australia, on Saturday night, a decision that has sparked controversy online.In a statement posted to his Instagram page, Barker, an American comedian, said a baby sitting a few rows away from the stage was ""talking"" at the start of his show, prompting him to make a few jokes about it. But when the baby ""called out again,"" Barker became concerned.""I then calmly informed the woman holding the baby that the baby couldn't stay,"" he said in the statement. ""I felt bad doing so and stated this at the time as well as several times throughout the remainder of the show.

He also pointed out that the show was for audiences 15 and older and said the theater should have flagged the baby's presence before it seated the mother.In an interview with the Australian TV show "" A Current Affair ,"" the mother, Trish Faranda, said she left the show feeling humiliated, adding that she had gone to the show because it was something she did ""pre-kids and always really enjoyed."" Faranda said that she attended the Melbourne International Comedy Festival show with a game plan to leave if her 7-month-old, Clara, became ""disruptive.""""She started gurgling, babbling ... but not for very long, because then I just gave her a quick feed, and she was quiet,"" Faranda told the show.   Then, the baby started making sounds again, which Faranda described as not ""as loud as someone coughing."" ""Then he was sort of like, 'Oh, no, it’s really disruptive, you’re interrupting my rhythm.' ... Then he threw back to the crowd and was basically trying to get their support to say 'get out,'"" Faranda told ""A Current Affair,"" saying she felt heckled. Barker did not address possible heckling, but he mentioned in his statement that his decision to ask the woman to leave had nothing to do with whether she was breastfeeding or not. ""For the record, I support public breastfeeding, as it's perfectly natural,"" he said.He did not apologize to Faranda for asking her to leave but said he feels bad ""for any upset it has caused the parties involved, or my fans, or babies.""""I've nothing against babies, in fact I was one once, for almost 2 years,"" Barker said.

While the financial results were short of Wall Street's expectations, investors are breathing a sigh of relief that the company appears to be prioritizing new vehicles.Tesla has been facing more uncertainty on Wall Street than at any point since its  near-bankruptcy several years ago . Its share price has plunged by nearly two-thirds — from about $407 at its November 2021 peak to about $145 as of Tuesday's market close. The stock has held the title of the S&P 500's worst performer this year.Tesla remains the largest electric vehicle seller in the U.S., where  overall EV sales growth has slowed  after a booming 2023. According to industry website  InsideEVs , 19 Tesla competitors' combined sales growth over the past 12 months climbed 18% in the first quarter — the group's slowest rate in years as they sold just 102,000 all-electric vehicles altogether. Tesla, for its part, delivered 386,810 vehicles alone in that period, down 9% from the same quarter last year and falling well short of analyst expectations.""Pessimism on the entire EV marketplace has reached very high levels,"" Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at the financial services group Fundstrat Global Advisors, LLC, said in an email before Tesla reported its earnings.For the average Tesla investor, the falloff has meant significant financial losses over the past couple of years. The company's declines have been in China, whose most successful EV automaker, BYD — which does not sell in the U.S. — has emerged as a key Tesla rival. Today,  they are neck and neck  for title of world's largest EV maker.""They're going through a brutal demand situation in China, and Musk is now trying to turn this ship around, which went from a Cinderella ride to a Category 5 storm,"" Ives said.Facing greater competition, Tesla has been slashing prices to buoy sales,  announcing  over the weekend that it would discount Models Y, X and S by $2,000 each. It also said this month it would cut 14,000 employees, or 10% of its workforce.In the last quarter, Tesla ramped up sales of the much-anticipated Cybertruck, but it  recalled nearly 4,000 of them last week  over a dangerous accelerator pedal defect.Some Tesla investors attribute the company's troubles not only to broader EV sales trends but also to Musk's split focus across the other companies he oversees, especially the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.""There have been a lot of black-eye moments for Musk and Tesla,"" Ives said.The tech guru's net worth has shrunk by billions, though only enough to push him from No. 1 to No. 3 as the world’s richest person. His role in the company will be more formally examined in June, when Tesla investors will vote on whether to reinstate his  $56 billion pay package  after a Delaware judge struck it down earlier this year.""A lot of shareholders are using it as vote of confidence for the CEO,"" said Fred Lambert, a journalist who covers Tesla at EV website Electrek. But “in the grand scheme of things, Tesla is not in any danger,” he added.Musk has been working to shift the narrative around Tesla. He now says the company is an ""AI/robotics” company, even though cars still drive the bulk of its revenues. He recently posted on X that Tesla was now ""going balls to the wall for autonomy,"" and has placed a new emphasis on rolling out fully automated robotaxis.Lambert said he recently drove a new version of Tesla's automated driving technology, which is officially called Full Self-Driving (Supervised), since it still requires a driver to remain attentive to what the vehicle is doing. He said the new software marks a leap forward and will further benefit from explosive gains in artificial intelligence in the broader tech world.Increasingly, Tesla's investments are going toward autonomous vehicle technology. While it's not yet clear what the current consumer demand is for self-driving cars, Tesla is positioning itself to have an enormous head start, said Tyson Jominy, vice president for data and analytics at J.D. Power.""Given the number of cars they've sold, they've got a potential fleet of sleeper AVs ready to be activated by executive order ... when and if that time comes,"" Jominy said.

J.J. McCorvey,"Car insurance costs are pretty brutal at the moment — they’re  up more than 22%  since this time last year. There’s plenty you can do to lower your bill, but  some of the best advice out there  still requires a certain amount of upfront cash.For example, paying your annual premium all in one go could eliminate the extra fees some insurers charge customers for paying month by month. But that may not be an option if your budget is tight and your premium has surged.Insurers have been playing catch-up since the pandemic, said Stephen Crewdson, senior director of insurance intelligence at J.D. Power. They were late to raise rates when auto prices were ticking up, and now their hikes are setting in even as vehicle prices cool. Nearly 14% of consumers reported shopping for new insurance last month, a  recent J.D. Power survey  found — the highest monthly rate since it started tracking the figure in 2020.“We should hopefully see these premium increases taper off as time goes by,” Crewdson said.In the meantime, there are still some ways to lower your bill this year. Here’s where to start.<h2>Shop widely for discounts</h2>Auto insurance customers this year are “gonna have to be more aggressive” to find savings, said Lee Baker, an Atlanta-based financial planner and founder of Apex Financial. “You might need to cast a wider net.”That means checking all the discounts on offer, starting with your current carrier. From military discounts to bundling opportunities, policyholders often leave money on the table simply by not picking up the phone. When J.D. Power surveys consumers, it finds many aren’t fully aware what savings are out there, Crewdson said.“Ask somebody at your insurer. If you have an agent, ask your agent,” he said. “If you don’t have an agent, call in to the insurer, visit the website, look at the app and look at what discounts they offer.”Experts also suggest considering the organizations in your orbit. Many professional and trade associations, alumni groups and even fraternity and sorority associations often negotiate discounts with insurers.But your employer may be the best place to start hunting for perks. “Your benefits package, at least for large employers — there’s a lot of little nuggets in there that people gloss over,” said Preston Cherry, founder of Concurrent Financial Planning in Green Bay, Wisconsin.While employers typically work with only a single insurer and any discounts probably won’t be drastic, experts said, they can help you start chipping away at your monthly costs.<h2>Take that defensive driving course</h2>Financial experts say this is one of the easiest strategies. Many insurance companies offer considerable savings when policyholders complete defensive driving courses — most of which are online — from organizations such as the  National Safety Council  or  Defensive Driving by IMPROV .“I always recommend taking defensive driving every year,” said Cherry. “The discount is worth it.”Carriers in at least 34 states and Washington, D.C., typically offer discounts of up to 10% for course completion,  according to I Drive Safely , a defensive driving course proctor.Many carriers also offer their own programs for good driving behavior — though some require agreeing to a measure of surveillance. Progressive’s Snapshot, for example, offers policyholders a mobile app or a plug-in device for their vehicles that track, among other things, your braking patterns and the times of day you get behind the wheel, then use that information to determine your discount eligibility.One caveat: Risky behavior can trigger a higher rate when it’s time to renew your policy, said Jude Boudreaux, a certified financial planner and partner at the Planning Center in New Orleans. But “if you’re trying to drive pretty conservatively and around town, using those can be a way to save some additional costs,” he said.For those who work remotely or don’t drive much, Boudreaux also suggests pay-per-mile plans. These also rely on mileage- and behavior-tracking devices that may entail privacy trade-offs but could be a boon for some. Nationwide’s SmartMiles program, for example, offers a low base rate plus a variable one that depends on mileage. And for periodic longer road trips, it counts only the first 250 miles per day.<h2>Check for family-friendly fine print</h2>For consumers with kids who drive or are about to start, there’s a lot to consider that can affect your bill.While it’s generally cheaper to add a teen driver to an existing policy or bundle than it is to buy a new one, repeated infractions (tickets, fender benders) can drive up your household’s costs, so weigh the trade-offs carefully.“Sometimes bringing them inside the bundled package works, sometimes not,” said Cherry. “That’s always a tricky one.”He advises starting any young drivers in your family on an inexpensive or mostly paid-off car. Since it has become  more expensive to repair vehicles  lately, consider how much cash you’re willing to risk on your kid’s behalf.“It’s really trying to save costs by placing them in a vehicle that’s not much to insure and counterbalances their inexperience risk level to insure,” Cherry said.Baker said academic achievements can also help trim your insurance costs. Many carriers offer “good student” discounts, typically for high-school or college students under age 25. Maintaining a B average or performing well on the SAT or ACT could net substantial savings. State Farm, for example, offers up to 30% off for high marks.“There’s no guarantee that a student with good grades won’t get behind the wheel and do something crazy,” Baker conceded, but insurers are betting — for better or worse — that “if they’re doing right in school, they’re probably less risky.”<h2>Trim the fat from your policy</h2>Sometimes savings are staring up at you from your current insurance plan, experts said. Check your policy for redundancies and areas of overlap, said Cherry. For example, if you pay for AAA roadside assistance, you may be able to shave similar coverage off your auto insurance policy. Some newer cars already include some form of roadside assistance, he added.A common tactic for lowering monthly premiums is to choose a policy with a higher deductible. Marcus Miller, a Jacksonville, Fla.-based financial planner at Mainstay Capital, urged caution here. Some clients, he said, “go in and just start slashing” line items from their policies and end up underinsured.Instead, it’s smart to first build up an emergency fund for a potentially high deductible — and then make the switch, he advised.Customers “could reasonably increase their deductible, as long as they have that cash set aside,” Miller said. “That will reduce their premium.”",2024-04-20 01:15:00 AM EEST,NBC,Car insurance rates are nuts right now.

"Jay Blackman,Phil Helsel","A federal rule announced Wednesday will require airlines to quickly give cash refunds — without lengthy arguments — to passengers whose flights have been canceled or seriously delayed, the Biden administration said.“Passengers deserve to get their money back when an airline owes them — without headaches or haggling,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement.The rule from the Department of Transportation says passengers who decline other reimbursement like travel credits are to get a cash refund.It applies to canceled flights or when flights have a “significant change,” the administration said.A “significant change” includes when departure or arrival times are three or more hours different than scheduled for domestic flights or six hours for international flights, and also cases where the airport is changed or connections added, it said.Passengers are also to get a refund when their baggage is 12 hours late in delivery for domestic flights.The new rule comes after promises to hold airlines accountable after major disruptions that made travel hell for passengers, including the  2022 Southwest Airlines meltdown  that resulted in  almost 17,000  significantly delayed or canceled flights and a missing baggage nightmare.The Department of Transportation said that the new rule means refunds are automatic, and ""airlines must automatically issue refunds without passengers having to explicitly request them or jump through hoops.""Also announced Wednesday was a rule requiring airlines to more clearly disclose so-called ""junk fees"" such as surprise baggage or other fees, up-front, the department said.The department said that rule is expected to save fliers around $500 million a year. The surprise fees are used so that tickets look cheaper than they really are, and then fliers get the unwelcome surprise of fees on checked bags, carry-on bags, or reservation changes — or even discounts that are advertised but the discount only applies to part of the ticket price, officials said.Airlines will also have to tell fliers clearly that their seat is guaranteed, and they don't have to pay extra to ensure they have a seat for the flight, according to the department.Airlines for America, an industry trade group, said that its member airlines “offer transparency and vast choice to consumers from first search to touchdown,” and that they do offer cash refunds.The 11 largest U.S. airlines returned $10.9 billion in cash refunds last year, an increase over the $7.5 billion in 2019 but slightly down from the $11.2 billion in 2022, the group said.“U.S. airlines are providing more options and better services while ticket prices, including ancillary revenues, are at historic lows,” Airlines for America said.Left out of the federal changes announced Wednesday are those involving ""family seating fees,"" but the Transportation Department said in a statement that ""DOT is planning to propose a separate rule that bans airlines from charging these junk fees."" Travelers have complained to the DOT  that children were not seated next to an accompanying adult, including in some cases young children, department officials said last year.Fees on bags specifically have made up an increasing amount of airline revenues, the DOT said Wednesday in announcing the new rules.A department analysis found that airline revenue from baggage fees increased 30 percent between 2018 and 2022, while operating revenue — which is from the flights themselves — increased by only half that amount, the DOT said.",2024-04-24 13:00:00 PM EEST,NBC,Airlines must cough up cancellation cash and can no longer hide fees under new federal rule,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/new-federal-rule-guarantee-hassle-free-airline-cash-refunds-administra-rcna149087
"Hugh Son, CNBC,Melissa Repko, CNBC","Walmart’s  majority-owned fintech startup  One  has begun offering buy now, pay later loans for big-ticket items at some of the retailer’s more than 4,600 U.S. stores, CNBC has learned.The move puts One in direct competition with  Affirm , the BNPL leader and exclusive provider of installment loans for Walmart customers since 2019. It’s a relationship that the Bentonville, Arkansas, retailer  expanded  recently, introducing Affirm as a payment option at Walmart self-checkout kiosks.It also likely signals that a battle is brewing in the store aisles and ecommerce portals of America’s largest retailer. At stake is the role of a wide spectrum of players, from fintech firms to card companies and established banks.One’s push into lending is the clearest sign yet of its ambition to become a financial superapp, a mobile one-stop shop for saving, spending and borrowing money.Since it  burst  onto the scene in 2021, luring  Goldman Sachs  veteran  Omer Ismail  as CEO, the fintech startup has intrigued and threatened a financial landscape dominated by banks — and poached talent from more established lenders and payments firms.But the company, based out of a cramped Manhattan WeWork space, has operated mostly in stealth mode while developing its early  products , including a debit account released in 2022.Now, One is going head-to-head with some of Walmart’s existing partners like Affirm who helped the retail giant generate $648 billion in revenue last year.On a recent visit by CNBC to a New Jersey Walmart location, ads for both One and  Affirm  vied for attention among the Apple products and Android smartphones in the store’s electronics section.Offerings from both One and Affirm were available at checkout, and loans from either provider were available for purchases starting at around $100 and costing as much as several thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of between 10% to 36%, according to their respective websites.Electronics, jewelry, power tools and automotive accessories are eligible for the loans, while groceries, alcohol and weapons are not.Buy now, pay later has gained popularity with consumers for everyday items as well as larger purchases. From January through March of this year, BNPL drove $19.2 billion in online spending, according to Adobe Analytics. That’s a 12% year-over-year increase.Walmart and One declined to comment for this article.<h2>Who stays, who goes?</h2>One’s expanding role at Walmart raises the possibility that the company could force Affirm,  Capital One  and other third parties out of some of the most coveted partnerships in American retail, according to industry experts.“I have to imagine the goal is to have all this stuff, whether it’s a credit card, buy now, pay later loans or remittances, to have it all unified in an app under a single brand, delivered online and through Walmart’s physical footprint,” said  Jason Mikula , a consultant formerly employed at Goldman’s consumer division.Affirm declined to comment about its Walmart partnership.For Walmart, One is part of its broader effort to develop new revenue sources beyond its retail stores in areas including finance and health care, following rival  Amazon’s  playbook with cloud computing and streaming, among other segments. Walmart’s newer businesses have higher margins than retail and are a part of its plan to grow profits faster than sales.In February, Walmart said it was buying TV maker Vizio for  $2.3 billion  to boost its advertising business, another growth area for the retailer.<h2>'Bank of Walmart'</h2>When it comes to finance, One is just Walmart’s latest attempt to break into the banking business. Starting in the 1990s, Walmart made  repeated  efforts to enter the industry through direct ownership of a banking arm, each time getting blocked by lawmakers and industry groups concerned that a “Bank of Walmart” would crush small lenders and squeeze big ones.To sidestep those concerns, Walmart adopted a more arms-length approach this time around. For One, the retailer  created a joint venture  with investment firm firm Ribbit Capital — known for backing fintech firms including  Robinhood,  Credit Karma and Affirm — and staffed the business with executives from across finance.Walmart has not disclosed the size of its investment in One.The startup has said that it makes decisions independent of Walmart, though its board includes Walmart U.S. CEO, John Furner, and its finance chief, John David Rainey.One doesn’t have a banking license, but partners with  Coastal Community Bank  for the debit card and installment loans.After its failed early attempts in banking, Walmart pursued a partnership strategy, teaming up with a constellation of providers, including Capital One,  Synchrony,  MoneyGram,  Green Dot , and more recently, Affirm. Leaning on partners, the retailer opened thousands of physical MoneyCenter locations within its stores to offer check cashing, sending and receiving payments, and tax services.<h2>From paper to pixels</h2>But Walmart and One executives have made no secret of their ambition to become a major player in financial services by leapfrogging existing players with a clean-slate effort.One’s no-fee approach is especially relevant to low- and middle-income Americans who are “underserved financially,” Rainey, a former  PayPal  executive, noted during a December conference.“We see a lot of that customer demographic, so I think it gives us the ability to participate in this space in maybe a way that others don’t,” Rainey said. “We can digitize a lot of the services that we do physically today. One is the platform for that.”One could generate roughly $1.6 billion in annual revenue from debit cards and lending in the near term, and more than $4 billion if it expands into investing and other areas, according to  Morgan Stanley .Walmart can use its scale to grow One in other ways. It is the largest private employer in the U.S. with about 1.6 million employees, and it already offers its workers early access to wages if they sign up for a corporate version of One.<h2>Walmart's next card</h2>There are signs that One is making a deeper push into lending beyond installment loans.Walmart recently  prevailed  in a legal dispute with  Capital One , allowing the retailer to end its credit-card partnership years ahead of schedule. Walmart  sued  Capital One last year, alleging that its exclusive partnership with the card issuer was void after it failed to live up to contractual obligations around customer service, assertions that Capital One denied.The lawsuit led to speculation that Walmart intends to have One take over management of the retailer’s co-branded and store cards. In fact, in legal filings Capital One itself alleged that Walmart’s rationale was less about servicing complaints and more about moving transactions to a company it owns.“Upon information and belief, Walmart intends to offer its branded credit cards through One in the future,” Capital One said last year in response to Walmart’s suit. “With One, Walmart is positioning itself to compete directly with Capital One to provide credit and payment products to Walmart customers.”Capital One said last month that it could  appeal  the decision. The company declined to comment further.Meanwhile, Walmart  said  last year when its lawsuit became public that it would soon announce a new credit card option with “meaningful benefits and rewards.”One has obtained lending licenses that allow it to operate in nearly every U.S. state, according to filings and its  website . The company’s app tells users that credit building and credit score monitoring services are coming soon.<h2>Catching Cash App, Chime</h2>And while One’s expansion threatens to supersede Walmart’s existing financial partners, Walmart’s efforts could also be seen as defensive.Fintech players including  Block’s  Cash App, PayPal and Chime dominate account growth among people who switch bank accounts and have made inroads with Walmart’s core demographic. The three services made up 60% of digital player signups last year, according to data and consultancy firm  Curinos .But One has the advantage of being majority owned by a company whose customers make more than 200 million visits a week.It can offer them enticements including 3% cashback on Walmart purchases and a savings account that pays 5% interest annually, far higher than most banks, according to customer emails from One.Those terms keep customers spending and saving within the Walmart ecosystem and helps the retailer better understand them,  Morgan Stanley  analysts said in a 2022 research note.“One has access to Walmart’s sizable and sticky customer base, the largest in retail,” the analysts wrote. “This captive and underserved customer base gives One a leg up vs. other fintechs.”",2024-04-23 16:31:00 PM EEST,NBC,"Walmart-backed fintech One introduces buy now, pay later as it prepares bigger push into lending",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/walmart-backed-fintech-one-introduces-buy-now-pay-later-prepares-bigge-rcna148944
"Rob Wile,Scott Wong","TikTok’s fate in the U.S. has never been more in doubt after the House of Representatives approved a bill last weekend that gives its parent company two options: sell it to an approved buyer or see it banned.Experts say the bill is now likely to be approved in the Senate, and President Joe Biden has signaled he would sign it. But it could take years for the TikTok ban to actually go into effect, since its Chinese-owned parent company, ByteDance, is likely to challenge the statute in court. And even if it survives a legal challenge, no one is quite sure what would happen next. How soon could a potential ban take effect?It would probably be several years from now.According to the statute’s language, ByteDance would have nine months to divest and find an American buyer for TikTok once the bill is signed into law. On top of that, the president can push back the deadline by an additional 90 days. That means, without a sale, the soonest TikTok could shut down in the U.S. would be more than one year from now.  But it’s more complicated than that. If ByteDance sues to block the implementation of the statute — which it has said it would do — the bill will be taken up by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, according to Isaac Boltansky, director of policy for the financial services firm BTIG.Boltansky said ByteDance would file a suit no later than this fall. And while the case is under judicial review, the “clock” on any ban is effectively paused, he said. Once the D.C. court issues its ruling, whichever side loses is likely to request a review by the U.S. Supreme Court.That would forestall the ban by another year — meaning nothing would go into effect until 2026, Boltansky said.    TikTok will argue that the ban is unconstitutional and that it’s also taken steps to protect American users’ data. The app has already launched an aggressive lobbying campaign, featuring a number of small-business owners and influencers who say it's their lifeblood.“We have got to make enough noise so that they don’t take away our voice,” TikTok user @dadlifejason, who has 13.8 million followers, says in a  TikTok ad  shared on social media.What about finding a buyer?The bill stipulates that TikTok can continue to operate in the U.S. if ByteDance sells the app to a U.S.-approved firm. While large U.S. tech companies would love to get their hands on the platform, Boltansky said that Biden administration regulators — not to mention GOP critics of Big Tech firms — have no interest in expanding the power, reach or influence of such companies.  Some other outside groups might emerge. At least one led by Steve Mnuchin, who was Treasury secretary in the Trump administration,  has already sought to make a bid,  telling CNBC in March that he was putting together an investor group . The Wall Street Journal has also  reported  that former Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick was looking for potential buyer partners. While ByteDance, which owns other companies, is worth hundreds of billions of dollars, TikTok would fetch less than that, experts say — especially if it is sold without its powerful recommendation algorithm.  But Boltansky believes ByteDance is unlikely to agree to any kind of sale. The Chinese government has said as much, arguing that it regards the algorithm as a national security asset. And without that, TikTok becomes much less appealing to potential buyers.    So is TikTok in the U.S. going away?It might — but the ultimate impact may be limited. The fact is, most TikTok users already have a presence on other platforms, so the  impact on their livelihoods to the extent that they operate businesses on TikTok could be limited.According to a survey from the financial services group Wedbush, approximately 60% of TikTok user respondents said they’d simply migrate to Instagram (or Facebook) in the event of a sale, while 19% said they’d go to YouTube. Analysts with financial services company Bernstein arrived at similar estimates. In a note to clients, they forecast that Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, would take over as much as 60% of TikTok’s U.S. ad revenue, with YouTube gaining 25%. Snapchat would also benefit, they said. Why did lawmakers feel they needed to take this drastic step?Boltansky said many political pundits remain surprised that the bill got over the finish line. But a wave of anxiety about both Chinese influence and the impact of social media on youth converged to get it passed.“This has been noteworthy,” Boltansky said. “Everyone is so conditioned to D.C. doing nothing or the bare minimum to keep the lights on.”As tensions with Beijing have grown, congressional lawmakers, along with top law enforcement officials, have warned that TikTok is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and is a national security threat to the United States.“It screams out with national security concerns,” FBI Director Christopher Wray testified on Capitol Hill last yearU.S. officials fear that the Chinese government is using TikTok to access data from, and spy on, its American users, spreading disinformation and conspiracy theories.It felt like a TikTok ban was moving slowly, then quickly. What happened?The House  passed its standalone TikTok bill  on a big bipartisan vote in March. But the Senate appeared in no hurry to take up the measure as Commerce Chair Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., drafted her own legislation.That all changed when Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., working with the White House, rolled out his $95 billion foreign aid supplemental plan last week that included billions of dollars for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. Included in that sweeping aid package: the House’s TikTok bill, with some minor changes. Johnson pushed the package through his chamber, then sent the House on a recess, forcing the Senate to take it or leave it.Rather than further delay the critical, long-stalled military and humanitarian aid, the Democratic-controlled Senate is moving to quickly pass the package — including the TikTok bill and other Johnson priorities.

CNBC,"U.S. prosecutors are seeking an above-guidance sentence of 36 months for the former CEO of  cryptocurrency exchange Binance  on charges of enabling money laundering, according to a sentencing memorandum out late Tuesday.The memorandum, which was filed with the court for the western district of Washington, states that Zhao should serve a higher sentence that suggested under advisory guidelines to “reflect the gravity of his crimes.”Under advisory guidelines, Zhao’s sentencing would come in at a range of 12 to 18 months in prison.“A custodial sentence of 36 months—twice the high end of the Guidelines range—would reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for law, afford adequate deterrence, and be sufficient but not greater than necessary to achieve the goals of sentencing,” U.S. prosecutors said.Zhao is accused of wilfully failing to implement an effective anti-money laundering program as required by the Bank Secrecy Act, and of effectively allowing Binance to process transactions involving proceeds of unlawful activity, including transactions between Americans and individuals in sanctions jurisdictions.Binance has separately been sued by the U.S.  Securities and Exchange Commission  and the  Commodity Futures Trading Commission  over the alleged mishandling of customer assets and the operation of an illegal, unregistered exchange in the U.S.The U.S., which separately accuses Binance and Zhao of violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and sanctions on Iran, ordered Binance to pay $4.3 billion in fines and forfeiture. Zhao agreed to pay a $50 million fine.Zhao stepped down as Binance’s CEO in November last year after reaching this plea and was replaced by the former Abu Dhabi markets regulator’s chief, Richard Teng.Zhao was not immediately available for comment when contacted via social media platform X. Binance has yet to return a request for comment when contacted by CNBC.Prosecutors say that Zhao violated U.S. law on an “unprecedented scale,” and that he had a “deliberate disregard” for Binance’s legal responsibilities.In the memorandum of Tuesday, prosecutors said that, under Zhao’s control, Binance operated on a “Wild West” model.“Zhao bet that he would not get caught, and that if he did, the consequences would not be as serious as the crime,” the memorandum stated.“But Zhao was caught, and now the Court will decide what price Zhao should pay for his crimes.”Zhao’s official sentencing is expected to take place on April 30.",2024-04-24 13:13:00 PM EEST,NBC,U.S. prosecutors seek 36-month sentence for ex-Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/us-prosecutors-seek-36-month-sentence-ex-binance-ceo-changpeng-zhao-rcna149115
"Berkeley Lovelace Jr.,Erika Edwards","The Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that fragments of the  bird flu virus  had been detected in some samples of pasteurized milk in the U.S. While the agency maintains that the milk is safe to drink, it notes that it is still waiting on the results of studies to confirm this.The findings come less than a month after an outbreak of the H5N1 strain of bird flu was found,  for the first time , in  herds of dairy cows in several states . It has since been detected in herds  in eight states . The FDA has been working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to investigate the outbreak.The fragments of the virus were found while testing samples of pasteurized milk, the FDA said. The testing method, called PCR testing, looks for bits of genetic material; a positive result doesn’t mean that live, infectious virus has been found.“Based on available information, pasteurization is likely to inactivate the virus, however the process is not expected to remove the presence of viral particles,” the agency said in a release that it plans to make public later Tuesday. “To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe.”The FDA is specifically testing whether pasteurization inactivates bird flu in cow milk. The findings will be available in the “next few days to weeks,” it said.As a part of its testing, it will use so-called egg inoculation tests — considered the gold standard for determining if a sample is infectious — in which a chicken egg is injected with a small amount of infected milk and monitored to see if active virus begins to replicate.Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said he was not surprised by the preliminary findings. “If you tested most milk, you’d find E. coli and  listeria  and other things in it, too, but they’d all be dead. Pasteurization doesn’t take them out, it just kills them,” he said. That is, dead particles are unlikely to cause a person to get sick. “I wouldn’t have any problem drinking milk tonight from an influenza standpoint at all,” Osterholm said. “My grandchildren could drink the milk tonight.”But there has been a scarcity of information on the matter coming from the USDA, he said. More data is needed to fully understand what’s going on with the current bird flu virus in dairy cows.“We have a need for a lot of additional information that hasn’t been forthcoming,” Osterholm said. “We don’t know the epidemiology on these farms. We don’t know how many farms, how many samples. We have been very concerned.”The FDA said it has also recommended that milk producers take precautions when discarding milk from sick cows so that the discarded milk does not become a source of spread. One person has been infected during the current outbreak. The person, a  dairy worker in Texas , had a mild case and only developed conjunctivitis, or pinkeye.A senior official at the CDC also said the agency is monitoring the situation for signs of unusual illness in people and has not seen any beyond the Texas case.Still, the virus remains a cause of concern among health officials, given its particularly high mortality rate of around 50%. Bird flu doesn’t spread easily from person to person, but there’s worry that it could mutate as it spreads among cows to a version that spreads more easily among people. So far, there’s no evidence indicating that has happened,  according to the CDC .",2024-04-24 01:47:00 AM EEST,NBC,"Bird flu virus found in pasteurized milk, though officials maintain supply is safe",https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/bird-flu-virus-found-pasteurized-milk-though-officials-maintain-supply-rcna149084
The Associated Press,"DALLAS —  Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton  is dropping a request for a Seattle hospital to hand over records regarding  gender-affirming treatment  potentially given to children from Texas as part of a lawsuit settlement announced Monday.Seattle Children’s Hospital  filed the lawsuit  against Paxton’s office in December in response to the Republican appearing to go beyond state borders to investigate transgender health care. Paxton, a staunch conservative who has helped drive GOP efforts that target the rights of trans people, sent  similar letters to Texas hospitals  last year.The Seattle hospital said in a statement that it had “successfully fought” the “overreaching demands to obtain confidential patient information.” A judge in Austin dismissed the lawsuit Friday, saying the parties had settled their dispute.Texas is among states that have  enacted laws restricting or banning  gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors.The hospital’s lawsuit included a copy of the letter from Paxton’s office, which among other requests asked the hospital to produce records identifying medication given to children who live in Texas; the number of Texas children who received treatment; and documents that identified the “standard protocol or guidance” used for treatment.As part of the settlement, according to court records, the parties agreed that Seattle Children’s Hospital would withdraw its registration to transact business in Texas. But a hospital spokesperson said in a statement that they don’t operate health care facilities or provide gender-affirming care in Texas.In court records, the hospital had previously stated that it had a “limited number” of people who work remotely and live in Texas but that none were involved in gender-affirming care. It also said it did not advertise its services in Texas.“When we merely began asking questions, they decided to leave the State of Texas and forfeit the opportunity to do business here,” Paxton said in a news release Monday. He said Texas will “vigorously protect” children from gender-affirming treatment that he called “damaging.”The Texas law prevents transgender minors from accessing hormone therapies, puberty blockers and transition surgeries, even though medical experts say such surgical procedures are rarely performed on children.In Washington,  Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee  has signed  a law  that aims to protects minors seeking gender-affirming care there, part of  a wave of legislation in Democratic-led states  intended to give refuge to those seeking gender-affirming treatment.",2024-04-23 17:19:00 PM EEST,NBC,Seattle hospital won’t turn over gender-affirming care records in lawsuit settlement with Texas,https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/seattle-hospital-wont-turn-gender-affirming-care-records-lawsuit-settl-rcna148939
Abigail Brooks,"A progressive watchdog group sent letters Tuesday asking attorneys general in five states to investigate the privacy practices of  crisis pregnancy centers , arguing they could be misleading patients with claims that sensitive medical data is protected by health privacy laws, according to copies of the letters obtained by NBC News. While the letters don’t allege misuse of private health information the pregnancy centers collect, they ask the attorneys general to investigate what they use the information for and whether crisis pregnancy centers are using it to further anti-abortion goals.The letters, sent by the Campaign for Accountability, allege that the centers, which try to dissuade pregnant women from seeking abortions, gather sensitive and private medical information as part of their appointment scheduling processes. The letters asked the attorneys general of  Idaho ,  Minnesota ,  New Jersey,   Pennsylvania  and  Washington  to use their investigative power to probe why crisis pregnancy centers are gathering and retaining sensitive medical information and what they do with it — and potentially charge the centers with violating state consumer protection laws. The centers, which provide counseling and services for women coping with unplanned pregnancies, say on their websites that they comply with the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, known as  HIPAA , as a promise that the information is protected and kept confidential.However, because the centers offer services for free, they are not legally bound by federal health data privacy laws, creating a privacy risk that could be exploited in the wake of efforts to criminalize abortion, according to the letters.At the time of publication, the pregnancy centers discussed in the letters from Campaign for Accountability had not responded to a list of questions. The letters, signed by the group’s executive director, Michelle Kuppersmith, argue “women are guaranteed no actual privacy protection   when they hand over highly sensitive information about their pregnancies or reproductive health.” The practice is “particularly disturbing given some neighboring states’ desires to prosecute women who travel to seek abortion —   including to states where abortion remains legal,” Kuppersmith writes.Andrea Swartzendruber, an associate professor of biostatistics at the University of Georgia College of Public Health who studies crisis pregnancy centers, said: “They have so much information about the people who go to crisis pregnancy centers. There is some language in those forms that is completely problematic in the hands of crisis pregnancy centers.”Susannah Baruch, executive director of the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology and Bioethics at Harvard Law School, said claiming to be HIPAA-compliant while actually not being regulated by the federal privacy law could leave consumers whose data is shared without their consent with no recourse.“There can be enforcement mechanisms against an entity that doesn’t do what the privacy rule requires, assuming that entity is covered by the HIPAA privacy rule,” said Baruch, who said it would be difficult for “visitors to enforce their rights, because this is not an entity against whom they can sort of claim the protections and HIPAA privacy rules.”While many crisis pregnancy centers offer free services, such as pregnancy tests and ultrasound scans, as well as counseling, reproductive health doctors say many of them also provide  misleading or false information , such as linking abortion to mental illness or infertility, meant to discourage or prevent women from receiving abortion care. The rise of crisis pregnancy centersCommunity-based pregnancy centers began to crop up around the country in the 1960s. As the anti-abortion movement gained momentum after Roe v. Wade, religious activists began organizing them into national networks. Eventually, the centers shifted to take on the appearance of medical facilities to attract women seeking abortions and “impact a woman’s decision to choose life,” according to the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, the organization that introduced ultrasound technology into crisis pregnancy centers. However, the centers are not subject to the same standards as health facilities, and they are often unregulated by state health departments, which can lead to confusion over what services they actually offer: Women who are seeking abortions mistakenly schedule appointments at facilities that will try to counsel them against the procedure.There are more than 2,500 crisis pregnancy centers across the country, compared to just over 800 abortion clinics, according to the Guttmacher Institute,   a research group that supports access to abortion.   There have been attempts to restrict the centers by requiring them to display written notices informing women about abortion access. In 2018, the Supreme Court ruled the efforts  violated the First Amendment .Questioning whether crisis pregnancy centers engage in deceptive privacy practices is an approach that the Campaign for Accountability hopes will prove more effective.“CPCs are playing an increasing role in the anti-choice movement’s strategy,” Kuppersmith said. “Given the prevalence of these centers and their efforts to reach minors and other often low-income women, their activities merit close scrutiny.”Collecting dataThe crisis pregnancy centers discussed in the letters, like many across the country, are affiliated with Care Net and Heartbeat International, major pregnancy-center networks that describe themselves as religious ministries. In return for affiliation fees, pregnancy centers receive training, digital support and digital forms used to collect client information from women who interact with their facilities.“We believe we are better together, and our center management software reflects that by collecting data, across the pregnancy help movement, on critical metrics to provide powerful, actionable insights at the local level,” Heartbeat International writes on its website.Baruch, of Harvard Law School, said: “Many of the crisis pregnancy centers are part of networks, and they’re sharing the information up to the networks, which are there to try to reduce the number of people accessing abortion. We don’t know exactly what they would do with the information.”The Campaign for Accountability asks the same question in the letters, writing, “This raises the question of why”   crisis pregnancy centers are “gathering and retaining this highly sensitive medical and personal information and what the group does with this information.”Much of the data is collected on pregnancy centers’ websites, which prompt prospective clients to make appointments, much as they would for doctors’ visits. The online intake forms ask for private information such as first and last name, phone number, email address, date of birth, first day of last period and, in some cases, interest in obtaining abortion care and interest in specific pregnancy services. Voluntary complianceWebsites for the centers say they are “fully HIPAA-compliant.” Some of the centers discussed in the letters say in their privacy policies that they are “required by law to maintain the privacy and security of your protected health information” and instruct clients that if they believe their data has been compromised, they can “file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights.”However, in a blog post, Care Net acknowledges that compliance is voluntary, because the pregnancy centers are not actually bound by the federal privacy law.“Most centers do not meet the legal definition of a covered entity under the HIPAA regulation because they do not furnish, bill, or are paid for health care in the normal course of business and do not transmit health information in electronic form in connection with a transaction for which a HIPAA standard has been adopted by HHS,” the  blog post  says.That is also acknowledged in the privacy practices of some of the clinics discussed in the letters from Campaign for Accountability.Sage Women’s Center in Twin Falls, Idaho, writes on its website that “any transactions that invoke coverage of the HIPAA Privacy  Act” and therefore its privacy practices are “voluntarily undertaken.”  “Therefore, nothing in this notice should be construed as creating any contractual or legal rights on behalf of patients,” the privacy policy says.Privacy policies for two of the pregnancy centers say personal data can be disclosed without consent “when required by law, when required for public health reasons” or “when necessary to avert a threat of harm to you or a third person.” Privacy policies for the three others say personal data can be disclosed “as required by law” or “when required to protect our rights or your safety or the safety of others.”In the letters, Kuppersmith urges the attorneys general to investigate whether pregnancy centers could consider “a woman’s decision to seek abortion care as a ‘threat’ to the safety of a fetus and a ‘morally compelling’ reason to break confidentiality.”In their advertising and legal materials, Care Net and Heartbeat International maintain that confidentiality is a priority. “Personal and health information is treated highly confidentially,” Care Net writes  on its website.  “Except in rare cases where information must be shared in compliance with state law for the protection of an endangered child, or to protect the client or others from physical harm, client information is held in the strictest confidence.”A legal manual for Care Net and Heartbeat International pregnancy centers obtained by NBC News says: “For non-medical pregnancy centers, the confidentiality policy is primarily ethical, not legal.  “Nevertheless, because centers voluntarily promise confidentiality, centers could be held legally liable should such confidentiality be breached for inappropriate reasons.”In a  blog post , Care Net says its “pregnancy centers agree to respect client/patient privacy, and medical centers adhere to and distribute a notice of privacy practices modeled on HIPAA.” “Centers readily comply with all applicable confidentiality and HIPAA regulations that apply to many abortion clinics, retail clinics, and other physician’s offices,” the blog post says. “Care Net will disaffiliate any center that persists in violating or is unwilling to comply with our standards of affiliation.”In a statement to NBC News, Jor-El Godsey, president of Heartbeat International, said, “Pregnancy help organizations comply with all applicable laws, including state-level data privacy laws and applicable HIPAA provisions.”“For centers, confidentiality is so much more than merely complying with the law. It’s about serving her well, which includes safeguarding her private information and honoring her trust — hence the ethical duty to maintain confidentiality,” Godsey said. “Because our services are free of charge making HIPAA not applicable, confidentiality is of the utmost importance.”  At the time of publication, Care Net had not responded to a list of questions.On Monday, the Biden administration announced  new rules to strengthen HIPAA  to offer more legal protections for people who obtain or provide abortion care in states where it is legal to do so. The final policy prohibits health care organizations from disclosing private health information to state officials to conduct investigations or prosecute patients or providers. The new rule does not apply to crisis pregnancy centers, a Department of Health and Human Services official said.“Generally, a crisis pregnancy center that provides services for free and does not bill health insurance does not meet the definition of a covered entity under HIPAA and therefore the HIPAA Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules (‘HIPAA Rules’) do not apply,” the official told NBC News in an email.There is precedent for penalizing companies for misleading consumers about why their reproductive health information is being collected and how it is being shared. In 2021, the Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint alleging Flo, a period- and pregnancy-tracking app, shared millions of users’ data with third-party companies, despite having promised users their data would stay private.A group of Senate Democrats has tried to get answers about how crisis pregnancy center networks use and protect such data before, having sent a letter to Heartbeat International highlighting concerns that the data could be used in abortion-related prosecutions. In response, the organization declined to “respond materially” to questions about how and with whom it shares client data, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said in a news release, but it posted on its website that it has never “had a security breach related to client information,” maintaining that “any data we collect has always been secure, safe, and legal.”",2024-04-23 18:06:00 PM EEST,NBC,Watchdog group asks 5 attorneys general to investigate crisis pregnancy center privacy practices,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/watchdog-group-asks-5-attorneys-general-investigate-crisis-pregnancy-c-rcna148188
"Ashley Capoot, CNBC","UnitedHealth Group  on Monday said it paid ransom to cyberthreat actors to try to protect patient data, following the February cyberattack on its subsidiary  Change Healthcare . The company also confirmed that files containing personal information were compromised in the breach.“This attack was conducted by malicious threat actors, and we continue to work with the law enforcement and multiple leading cyber security firms during our investigation,” UnitedHealth told CNBC in a statement. “A ransom was paid as part of the company’s commitment to do all it could to protect patient data from disclosure.”The company did not specify the ransom payment amount.UnitedHealth, which has more than 152 million customers, said it has also determined that the cyberthreat actors accessed files containing protected health information and personally identifiable information, according to  a release Monday . The files “could cover a substantial proportion of people in America,” the release said.Change Healthcare offers payment and revenue cycle management tools. The company facilitates more than 15 billion transactions annually, and 1 in every 3 patient records passes through its systems. This means even patients who are not UnitedHealth customers could have been affected by the attack.UnitedHealth said in the release that 22 screenshots, allegedly of the compromised files, have been uploaded to the dark web. The company said no other data has been published, and it has not seen evidence that doctors’ charts or full medical histories were accessed in the breach.“We know this attack has caused concern and been disruptive for consumers and providers and we are committed to doing everything possible to help and provide support to anyone who may need it,” UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty said in the release.UnitedHealth said that concerned patients can visit a  dedicated website  for access to resources. The company has launched a call center that will offer free identity theft protections and credit monitoring for two years, the release said.The call center will not be able to offer any details about individual data impact given the “ongoing nature and complexity of the data review,” UnitedHealth said.",2024-04-23 18:24:00 PM EEST,NBC,"UnitedHealth paid ransom in Change Healthcare cyberattack, says patient data was compromised",https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/change-healthcare-ransom-cyberattack-patient-data-rcna148959
Rob Wile,"The Biden administration has issued a nationwide ban on the ability of employers to make their workers sign noncompete agreements, a move regulators said would help boost employee pay but which is set to be challenged in court by business groups.In a ruling Tuesday afternoon, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said noncompete clauses would henceforth be illegal. The measure was necessary, it said, for ""protecting the fundamental freedom of workers to change jobs, increasing innovation, and fostering new business formation.""“Noncompete clauses keep wages low, suppress new ideas, and rob the American economy of dynamism,” said FTC chair Lina M. Khan in a statement. “The FTC’s final rule to ban noncompetes will ensure Americans have the freedom to pursue a new job, start a new business, or bring a new idea to market.”The FTC estimates nearly one in five Americans are subject to noncompetes. They have grown increasingly common in lower wage or hourly work industries like fast food franchises, restaurants, and security firms, where some employers have sought to limit the ability of workers to effectively raise their pay by looking for work at competing establishments.   In addition to banning all new noncompetes, the FTC's rule applies to all existing noncompete agreements. Employers will now have to provide notice to workers bound to a current noncompete that it will not be enforced against them.The rule was hailed by labor groups and left-leaning policy experts.""Noncompetes are about reducing competition, full stop. It’s in their name,"" said Heidi Shierholz, president of the progressive nonprofit Economic Policy Institute. ""Noncompetes are bad for workers, bad for consumers, and bad for the broader economy. This rule is an important step in creating an economy that is not only strong but also works for working people.""The AFL-CIO, America's largest labor group, praised the new rule in a post on X Tuesday, saying noncompete agreements ""trap workers from finding better jobs, drive down wages, and stifle competition.""But business groups are already hitting out at the ban, saying noncompetes are essential to protecting trade secrets and proprietary information. The groups also say noncompetes ultimately help workers by engendering a more collaborative firm environment and limiting so-called ""free riders,"" or employees who  seek to capitalize on a specific company's methods and taking that knowledge elsewhere.  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the country’s largest business lobby, said it plans to sue the FTC over the ruling.  In a statement , it called the ban an ""unlawful power grab.""“This decision sets a dangerous precedent for government micromanagement of business and can harm employers, workers, and our economy,"" it said. Separately. a Dallas-based tax services firm filed a lawsuit in Texas federal court — which has proven hostile to Biden administration rulings — challenging not only the ban but the very structure of the FTC itself. ""We stand firm in our commitment to serve the rightful interest of every company to retain its proprietary formulas for success taught in good faith to its own employees,” said chairman and CEO G. Brint Ryan said in a statement. The FTC's rule is set to go into effect in August, but is unlikely to be enforced until the court challenges are resolved, something that could take years.
