Daysia Tolentino,"Over 250 popular musicians — including Billie Eilish, Green Day and  Dave Matthews — signed a letter Thursday urging the Senate Commerce Committee to support a bill that aims to reform the live-event ticketing system.The Fans First Act , which was introduced and referred to the Commerce Committee in December, hopes to remedy three major issues in the ticketing industry: ticket transparency, consumer protection and preventing bad actors from charging exorbitant resale prices. It is one of several bills introduced in recent years aimed at combating unfair ticketing practices, including the  BOSS and SWIFT Act  and the  TICKET Act .Fix the Tix, a coalition of live event industry organizations spearheaded by the National Independent Venue Association and Eventbrite, organized the letter, which was addressed to Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, the ranking member.Other artists who signed include: Cyndi Lauper, Jason Mraz, Lorde, Sia, Train, Fall Out Boy, Graham Nash, Becky G and Chappell Roan.Discontent toward the ticketing industry, especially Ticketmaster, reached a fever pitch in recent years. Fans  sued Ticketmaster  in 2022 after the company  struggled to keep up  with the demand for Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour. The Eras Tour debacle led to a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing to  examine Ticketmaster’s outsize role  in the industry. (Swift was not among the artists who signed the letter.)""We are joining together to say that the current system is broken: predatory resellers and secondary platforms engage in deceptive ticketing practices to inflate ticket prices and deprive fans of the chance to see their favorite artists at a fair price,"" the letter, a copy of which NBC News viewed, states.Stephen Parker, executive director of the National Independent Venue Association, said in a statement that “the time for comprehensive ticketing reform is now.”“It is clear that all participants of the live event ecosystem, from artists, to venues, to fans, demand comprehensive ticketing reform and consumer protection against the predatory ticket resale practices that have deeply afflicted live entertainment in the United States,” Parker said.The Fans First Act would require all ticket sellers and resellers to disclose and break down the total cost of a ticket, including fees. It would also bolster the Better Online Ticket Sales (BOTS) Act, which was introduced in 2016 to prohibit scalpers from using software to buy high volumes of tickets, by further prohibiting the use of bots to purchase tickets. ""We, as artists, as music lovers, and as concert attendees ourselves, urge you to support the Fans First Act to combat predatory resellers’ deceptive ticketing practices and the secondary platforms, which also profit from these practices,"" the letter sent Thursday states. ""Predatory resellers should not be more profitable than the people dedicating their lives to their art.""The senators co-sponsoring the bill are: John Cornyn, R-Texas; Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.; Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn.; Ben Ray Luján, D-N.M.; Roger Wicker, R-Miss.; Peter Welch, D-Vt.; Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss; and Mark Kelly, D-Ariz.Live Nation previously issued its support for the bill, saying the company welcomes “legislation that brings positive reform to live event ticketing.”The company, which owns Ticketmaster, is expected to be served an antitrust lawsuit by the Justice Department as soon as next month,  according to The Wall Street Journal .",2024-04-25 13:00:00 PM EEST,NBC,"Billie Eilish, Green Day and other artists back bill that would reform live-event ticketing system",https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/billie-eilish-green-day-artists-letter-of-support-fans-first-act-rcna149023
Kat Tenbarge,"TikTok creators weren’t surprised to hear that President Joe Biden signed into law a bill that could lead to a TikTok ban, but they’re close to unanimous in their belief that the federal government is wrong to push the legislation forward.For almost four years,  since July 2020 , a potential TikTok ban has been under consideration by members of the federal government. A bipartisan bill to ban TikTok in the U.S. was first proposed in December 2022, and the version that was just signed into law has been in the works since  before March . It’s not an immediate ban — it includes a nine-month deadline for the company to sell to a U.S.-approved owner or face a ban — and TikTok CEO Shou Chew says the company will  fight the decision  in court.On the app, chatter around the bill has been  going strong  for months, with creators and users incensed that Congress is focusing on TikTok over other issues that are popular with the app’s user base, which skews young.A  video from three days ago  from popular New York creator Dutch de Carvalho, which has close to 8 million views and 2 million likes, reviews a list of things Carvalho says Americans don’t have: affordable housing, student loan forgiveness, a higher minimum wage and free Covid-19 tests among them.“Can we at least watch videos on an app of people doing fun things and learn about the world around us?” the video’s creator says. “No. But don’t forget, we’re listening to you,” he says from the perspective of the government.Three TikTok creators with large followings shared their feelings with NBC News about the legislation and how the user base will continue to react to it.“I don’t think TikTok is going away,” Marcus DiPaola said. DiPaola covers news on TikTok to an audience of almost 4 million followers. He said that in court, the U.S. will have to show evidence for its primary concern  underlying the bill : that TikTok could be sharing American user data with the Chinese government, or that TikTok is recommending Chinese government propaganda to American users. TikTok has denied both. “They need to prove that they’re actively doing it, and I don’t see that happening,” DiPaola said. Still, DiPaola said, the proposed ban has stoked fear on the app. “You see that because every single video about TikTok getting banned blows up,” he said. “It’s not just creators; it’s users who don’t create anything. It’s the people with small businesses that depend on TikTok for advertising.” TikTok introduced  TikTok Shop  in September, which has allowed an explosion of small businesses to sell their products on the app, and creators to get a cut for advertising the products.A.B. Burns-Tucker, who has over 700,000 followers on TikTok, told NBC News that she, too, is concerned a TikTok ban would disrupt and disadvantage small-business owners in the U.S. who use the platform to advertise, especially Black and minority-owned businesses. Burns-Tucker, a paralegal, built an audience in part by covering current events in the language of African American Vernacular English.“This app provides us with a livelihood, people of color, where we didn’t have opportunities before,” Burns-Tucker said. “We’re forced, in the next nine months, to figure out how to pivot.”Heading into a presidential election, Burns-Tucker added that the move could further discourage voters and contribute to  persistent distrust  in the federal government.“We as users, as American citizens and voters, called our representatives and said, ‘We don’t want a TikTok ban,’” Burns-Tucker said, referencing TikTok’s recent  call to action  that prompted users to reach out to their representatives and senators about the bill. “They made it seem like we were being mind-controlled by TikTok to bully them.” Jules Terpak, who has over 350,000 followers on TikTok, thinks the conversation around banning TikTok will continue indefinitely, but she also doesn’t think it will make or break the 2024 presidential election.“Trump originally proposed this move back in 2020,” Terpak said. “I think people will ultimately remember and it won’t have much of an impact on Biden versus Trump.”Terpak urges creators to diversify their platforms and income streams, knowing that the future of any social media app is uncertain, especially TikTok.“I assume a sale or ban of TikTok will be a never-ending conversation until one of the two happens,” she added. “Even if this bill doesn’t end up going through somehow, I expect the topic to come up again and again.”",2024-04-25 01:13:00 AM EEST,NBC,TikTok creators react to Biden signing ban-or-sell law: 'We don't want a TikTok ban',https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/tiktok-creators-react-biden-signing-ban-sell-law-rcna149174
Rob Wile,"It will take some time for the Caitlin Clark effect to be felt across the WNBA.Clark enters the league as a budding superstar who is already widely recognized as having been the biggest figure in a sea change for women's basketball. Shortly after she helped the NCAA women's Final Four set broadcasting records, she went first overall in the WNBA draft, helping the event draw a bigger TV viewership than  the most recent MLB and NHL drafts . Tickets for the Indiana Fever, who drafted Clark last weekend, are the hottest in the sport.  Clark’s jersey has already sold out  — though Dick's Sporting Goods intends to sell Clark name and number T-shirts in all 724 of its locations, according to a company spokesperson. Last year, it sold WNBA merch in only a fraction of its stores. But even as women’s basketball surges broadly, Clark comes into a league that has faced steep financial shortcomings, leaving its players well short of being compensated at the levels of their male counterparts. “It’s not good enough,” Nancy Lieberman, a Hall of Fame basketball player, Olympic gold medalist and NCAA champion, said in an interview. “It has to get better.”It could take several years for all the crucial deals among players, the league, broadcast partners and other business interests to renegotiate the way money flows.Right now, WNBA players remain locked into the collective bargaining agreement, or CBA, they signed in 2020, which dictates their overall pay terms. Since the deal was signed, the revenue generated by the WNBA has grown — yet it still pales in comparison to those generated by the NBA.Last year,  a Bloomberg News report  found the WNBA was projected to make $180 million to $200 million for the 2023 season. A WNBA spokesperson declined to comment on the report, which NBC News hasn’t verified. The spokesperson also declined to discuss league financials. The WNBA's revenue compares with about $10 billion for the NBA in the season ending in 2022, the most recent year for which data is available.The WNBA’s lower revenue is a key reason for  the pay disparity between the leagues  that has now drawn national headlines, and it is why rookies, including Clark, will earn a base salary of just $76,000 this season.Of course, Clark will earn much more than that through outside sponsorship deals. And she is eligible for a suite of performance-based bonuses and marketing arrangements with her team, the Fever, and the league itself that are worth at least $500,000.   But that would still most likely be less than the NBA’s current league minimum of about $1 million. Technically, NBA rookies make slightly more than that. Players in the NBA’s lower-level G League are the exception; they typically earn a season salary of about $40,000.The gap between male and female basketball players isn’t only about the level of pay.  NBA players enjoy about a 50-50 split of so-called basketball-related revenues — like broadcast money and jersey sales — with owners.The CBA that WNBA players signed allowed for revenue sharing only if certain revenue thresholds were met. And so far, they’ve fallen short, a WNBA spokesperson confirmed. WNBA players can opt out of their CBA after this season — and it’s likely that they will, given the enormous growth the women’s game had been experiencing even before Clark captured America’s attention.The hope is that with Clark and other young stars entering the league, there will soon be more money and better terms for its players.In particular, the WNBA is poised to negotiate a new set of broadcasting rights that will increase the value of the league — enough to the point that the revenue sharing threshold would become moot, assuming the thresholds even remain.Ironically, the fate of the WNBA remains in the hands of the NBA, which controls more than 40% of the women's league. That's why Terri Carmichael Jackson, the Women’s National Basketball Players Association executive director, has called on the NBA to put the WNBA front and center.    ""It’s time the NBA recognizes the indispensable role of WNBA players in shaping the league’s future success,"" Carmichael Jackson said in a statement to NBC News. She continued: “They must acknowledge that valuing WNBA players and paying million-dollar salaries requires a stronger broadcast deal, one that absolutely necessitates players at the negotiating table to strengthen the business case and drive home their value.""Asked for comment, an NBA spokesperson referred NBC News to the WNBA.In a statement, WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said: “We continue to find ways to return some of the growth we have been experiencing to the players beyond what the CBA requires,"" referring to the collective bargaining agreement.We’re “increasing playoff bonuses by over 50% and providing a $4 million budgeted charter [flight] program for full playoffs, all back-to-backs requiring air travel, and the Commissioner Cup Championship Game,” Engelbert added.WNBA players aren’t necessarily asking to be paid at the same levels as their NBA counterparts. Rather, as Las Vegas Aces star Kelsey Plum said on an episode of the Vegas-centric “ The Residency Podcast ,” “We’re asking to get paid the same percentage of revenue shared.”Lieberman, the Hall of Famer, said there has been unwillingness to make the kinds of investments necessary to put the game front and center, on TV or elsewhere.""Being the first, it can be very lonely,"" she said, adding that, in many cases, her success had come from decision-makers — mostly men — who had ""taken a leap of faith.""Lieberman's comments echoed those of University of Connecticut women's coach Geno Auriemma, who was much more explicit in his criticism of the WNBA's growth efforts.“The WNBA is going to have to do a great job of marketing these guys,” he said at a news conference this month, referring to players like Clark and Huskies star Paige Bueckers. “And the WNBA I don’t think has done a great job of marketing their individual stars.”CORRECTION  (April 22, 2024, 9:54 a.m. ET) A previous version of this article misstated which Clark merchandise sold out at Dick’s Sporting Goods.

Reuters,"LONDON — Gay dating app Grindr is facing a mass data protection lawsuit in London from hundreds of users who allegedly had their private information, including HIV status, shared with third parties without consent, a law firm said on Monday.Austen Hayes, which said the lawsuit is being filed at London’s High Court, said thousands of Grindr users in the United Kingdom may have been affected.The firm alleges users’ highly sensitive information, including HIV status and the date of their latest HIV test, were provided to third parties for commercial purposes.Grindr said in a statement provided to the Guardian that it planned to “respond vigorously to this claim, which appears to be based on a mischaracterisation of practices from more than four years ago”.Austen Hayes said around 670 people had signed up to the lawsuit over breaches said to have taken place between 2018 and 2020, with potentially thousands more joining the case.Austen Hays’ Managing Director Chaya Hanoomanjee said in a statement: “Grindr owes it to the LGBTQ+ community it serves to compensate those whose data has been compromised and have suffered distress as a result, and to ensure all its users are safe while using the app, wherever they are, without fear that their data might be shared with third parties.”Grindr did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Associated Press,"Tesla knocked $2,000 off the prices of three of its five models in the United States late Friday, another sign of the challenges facing the electric vehicle maker led by billionaire Elon Musk.The company cut the prices of the Model Y, a small SUV which is Tesla’s most popular model and the top-selling electric vehicle in the U.S., and also of the Models X and S, its older and more expensive models. Prices for the Model 3 sedan and the Cybertruck stayed the same.The cuts reduced the starting price for  a Model Y  to $42,990 and to $72,990 for a Model S and $77,990 for a Model X.The move came the day after Tesla’s stock tumbled  below $150 per share , eliminating all gains made over the past year. The  Austin, Texas , company’s stock price has dropped about 40% so far this year amid  falling sales  and increased competition. Discounted sticker prices are a way to try to entice more car buyers.Musk posted early Saturday on X, the social media platform known as Twitter before he  acquired and renamed it , that the cost of an entry-level Tesla was as low as $29,490 once  a federal tax credit  and gas savings were factored in.Industry analysts have been waiting for Tesla to introduce a small electric vehicle that would cost around $25,000, the Model 2. Media reports this month that Musk planned to scrap the project created more uncertainty over the company’s direction, although Musk called them untrue.The price cuts ended a long workweek at Tesla, which announced Monday that it was  cutting 10% of its staff globally , about 14,000 jobs. The company also said it was  recalling nearly 4,000  of its 2024 Cybertrucks after discovering the accelerator pedal can get stuck, potentially causing the vehicle to accelerate unintentionally and increase the risk of a crash.On Saturday, Musk confirmed he had postponed a planned weekend trip to India to meet with  Prime Minister Narendra Modi , citing “very heavy Tesla obligations.” He said on X that he looked forward to rescheduling the visit for later this year.Tesla is scheduled to announce its first-quarter earnings on Tuesday.The company reported earlier this month that its worldwide sales fell sharply from January through March as competition increased worldwide, electric vehicle sales growth slowed, and earlier price cuts failed to lure more buyers.It was Tesla’s first year-over-year quarterly sales decline in nearly four years.",2024-04-21 01:19:00 AM EEST,NBC,"Tesla cuts U.S. prices on its Model Y, S and X vehicles after a difficult week",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/tesla-cuts-us-prices-3-electric-vehicle-models-difficult-week-rcna148693
"Erika Edwards,Akshay Syal, M.D.","The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Wednesday issued a federal order that any dairy cows being transported from one farm to another across state lines should be tested for bird flu. The new order comes one day after the Food and Drug Administration said that  fragments of the bird flu virus were found  in samples of pasteurized milk on store shelves. On Wednesday, the FDA said that, in order to identify where the contaminated milk was found, it was conducting a nationwide survey of commercially sold milk and would release its results in the coming days.When the outbreak was  first detected at the end of March , in an effort to keep the milk supply safe, farmers were instructed to discard the milk of sick cows, Don Prater, acting director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said during a joint media briefing Wednesday. Farmers were also told by the USDA to test symptomatic cows.The discovery of the virus in the commercial milk supply, however, indicates those approaches weren't enough.It's unclear how the new mandate might curb the spread of the virus  — a strain of the bird flu called H5N1 — among the nation’s cattle. The virus has already been detected in dairy cows in  eight states : Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Dakota, Ohio and Texas.A big question for scientists now is, how long has it been going on and where else has it spread?""I think it's safe to say that it's longer and much more extensive that has been realized,"" said Dr. Michael Mina, an epidemiologist and former professor of immunology and infectious diseases at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.The outbreak concerns scientists and public health officials because H5N1 can be especially deadly in people. However, once in people, the virus doesn't spread easily.Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said during the media briefing that there's no indication that the H5N1 flu strain is causing any uptick in illness among people or poses an immediate danger to the public.“CDC has not identified any out-of-the-ordinary influenza-related emergency department visits, even when we compare areas where H5N1 has spread among cattle against areas where it has not,” Shah said.One person,  a dairy worker in Texas , was infected earlier this month. The CDC said that the case was mild and the worker developed conjunctivitis, or pink eye.Shah noted that another 44 people are being “actively monitored,” for illness.In addition to testing dairy cows before transporting them, Wednesday's order also requires that state veterinary labs report any positive tests to federal health authorities. “If [the cows] end up testing positive, they will have a 30-day waiting period before they could move and have to be tested again,” Mike Watson, administrator for the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said during the media briefing.The worry is not whether people can catch the flu by drinking milk. The U.S. milk supply undergoes a mandatory pasteurization process, heating milk to a point where any bacteria or virus should be killed.Though the FDA has not completed studies specifically looking at whether pasteurization kills the virus that causes bird flu, the agency said on Tuesday that, ""to date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe.""The FDA plans to release results of studies looking at pasteurization's effects on the bird flu virus in the coming days or weeks.",2024-04-25 02:26:00 AM EEST,NBC,USDA orders dairy cows to be tested for bird flu if moved across state lines,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/usda-orders-dairy-cows-tested-bird-flu-moved-state-lines-rcna149121
Variety,"Writers at  Sesame Workshop  reached a five-year agreement with the production company behind “Sesame Street,” averting the possibility of picket lines popping up in the show’s friendly neighborhood.The Writers Guild of America confirmed the deal late Friday. The group of 35 writers employed by the nonprofit organization voted unanimously to support a strike authorization vote last week.“We are so proud to work for an organization that values its writers, and we believe this new contract will positively impact writers throughout the children’s media landscape. ‘S’ truly is for Solidarity. We are glad to have a contract in place that allows Sesame to do what it does best — lead,” the  WGA ‘s Sesame Workshop Negotiating Committee said in a statement.The union sought to ensure that writing for the show’s animated segments and social media content would be covered by minimum rates. According to the guild, the deal includes those provisions. The deal also includes paid parental leave benefits, artificial intelligence provisions, and an improved residual in streaming.The contract was set to expire on Friday, and writers were set to begin picketing next week if an agreement had not been reached.Sesame Workshop lauded what it described as an “industry benchmark” of a deal.“We value our writers and their significant contributions to the creative process, which are integral to our ability to deliver on our nonprofit mission,” a Sesame Workshop spokeswoman said. “This agreement is a testament to our dedication to our creative talent, and we appreciate the WGA’s collaboration in working with us to establish this new industry benchmark.”Sesame Workshop is based in New York but scribes for the company are represented by both WGA West and WGA East. “Sesame Street” airs on the streamer Max as well as PBS.“Sesame Workshop writers won a new agreement that recognizes the value of the incredible work they do to educate and enlighten children around the world. This contract could not have been achieved without the solidarity and fortitude shown by the entire bargaining unit throughout the negotiations.

"Fallon Gallagher,Laura Jarrett","BOISE, Idaho — It was the news that every expectant mother dreads. Twelve weeks pregnant with her second child, Jennifer Adkins learned her developing fetus had Turner syndrome, a rare chromosomal abnormality, and was unlikely to survive. On top of that, doctors warned that her own health could be in jeopardy. Adkins was at high risk of what’s known as Mirror Syndrome — a condition in which the pregnant mother develops symptoms that mimic those of her deteriorating fetus, including swelling, high blood pressure and potentially pre-eclampsia. But when she raised the prospect of terminating the pregnancy with her doctors, Adkins learned it was not an option: The fetus still had a heartbeat.“They said we’re surprised that you’re still pregnant, given the severity of what we’re seeing on ultrasound. Most people would have miscarried by now,” she said. “I was just in total, total shock.”Idaho is one of more than a  dozen states that have banned nearly all abortions . Anyone who performs an abortion here is subject to up to five years in prison, and medical professionals who violate the law can also lose their licenses.The law provides an exemption if a doctor finds the procedure is necessary to prevent the death of the woman. But doctors in Idaho say there’s significant confusion about what to do when a patient is carrying a fetus that is not viable and could cause devastating complications, but she is not on the brink of death.“It makes no sense that we’re just going to wait until you’re on death’s door and then we’ll act,” said Dr. Duncan Harmon, one of only five full-time doctors specializing in maternal fetal medicine who remain in Idaho.The bind in which some Idaho doctors find themselves is at the heart of a lawsuit the U.S. Supreme Court must now consider. The justices heard  oral arguments  Wednesday and will decide whether the state’s abortion ban conflicts with a federal law that requires hospitals receiving federal funding to provide patients whatever treatment is necessary, including abortions, to stabilize them in emergencies. In their questions, several of the liberal justices raised examples of medical complications — such as the premature rupture of membranes — that could pose serious bodily injury if not immediately addressed but would not necessarily be fatal.It’s not the only legal challenge to Idaho’s law: Adkins has brought a lawsuit against Idaho in state court, along with three other women and two doctors, asking the court to clarify the scope of the state’s abortion ban. A trial is tentatively set for later this year.In Adkins’ case, waiting to miscarry naturally could have taken weeks. So she and her husband, John, packed their bags, cobbled together funds and drove six hours to Oregon for an abortion. “We were both disgusted by the treatment of our state,” she said. “Not only did we have to go through the trauma and grief of losing a very wanted baby, but then we had to have this emotional trauma of traveling to get the procedure.”Asked about Adkins’ lawsuit Wednesday, Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a Republican, said the law is “very clear.” “The law in Idaho protects unborn children and protects the life of the mother, and any instance where the life of mother’s in jeopardy, [abortion] will be allowed by the state of Idaho,” he said.But Gail Deady, a senior staff attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, the legal advocacy group representing Adkins, said she does not think “most doctors in Idaho have an understanding of where that line is.”Harmon said it’s an approach that contradicts medical training.“The idea of not acting, which might hasten the clinical situation to worsen, so that we can act only at the very end is counterintuitive to anything in medicine that I know,” he said.Even if an expectant mother is not on the verge of death, said Dr. Sara Thomson, an OB-GYN in the Boise area, it can still be heartbreaking to deny her the ability to end a pregnancy if she has a medical complication that means the baby is not going to survive.“Having her stay pregnant for hours or days longer, until she’s in a situation where we can declare her medical condition life-threatening, does nothing to benefit the baby and only harms the mother,” she said, adding, “We are adding trauma onto a situation that’s already traumatizing, and to feel like our hands are tied by a state legislature who doesn’t understand this clinical detail is super frustrating.”In the 15 months after Idaho’s abortion ban went into effect in August 2022, Idaho lost 22%  of its 268 OB-GYNs , according to  a report from the Idaho Physician Well-Being Action Collaborative . Because of that, Thomson said, “even if you don’t have any complications, you may find yourself in a situation where you are having to drive many miles, more than an hour, to have a prenatal visit or to deliver your baby.”Thomson added that she, too, updated her résumé recently — for the first time in 10 years.Harmon, however, said he plans to stay, at least for now.“Those of us [who] are left are kind of thinking … we got to stick around, because if we don’t, who will?“ he said. Adkins is pregnant again in a state that she feels has already failed her once.“It’s scary, and it continues to get scarier,” she said. “Just knowing what the state of maternal care is in our state right now, it’s like walking on eggshells.”",2024-04-25 01:27:00 AM EEST,NBC,Mother describes leaving Idaho for an abortion as Supreme Court considers its ban,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/idaho-abortion-ban-supreme-court-mother-lawsuit-rcna148945
"Brian Schwartz, CNBC,Kevin Breuninger, CNBC","Shares of  Trump Media  shot up more than 9% on Wednesday, hours after the company revealed it was urging House  Republican  committee leaders to investigate possible “unlawful manipulation” of its  stock .The stock boost also came one day after a deadline passed for former President  Donald Trump , the company’s majority owner, to become eligible for an additional 36 million  “earnout” shares . That stake was worth more than $1.3 billion as of the share price at 3:25 p.m. ET.It was unclear what spurred the sudden rise of Trump Media, which began the trading day down nearly 5% before turning positive later Wednesday morning.The company’s CEO, Devin  Nunes , in a  letter  Tuesday asked the GOP chairs to probe “anomalous trading” of the stock in order to gauge the extent of the alleged manipulation and “whether any laws including RICO statutes and tax evasion laws were violated.”The request doubles down on  Nunes’ claim  that Trump Media, which trades under the ticker DJT, is the apparent victim of “naked” short selling, the practice of selling a company’s shares without first borrowing them for that purpose.Trump Media, which began trading on the  Nasdaq  on March 26 after completing a lengthy public merger, was far and away the most expensive U.S. stock to short as of early April.Brokers therefore “have a significant financial incentive to lend non-existent shares,” wrote Nunes, himself a former House GOP chair, in the letter.The probe is necessary to protect the company’s shareholders and to ensure that “the perpetrators of any illegal activity can be held to account,” he wrote.The CEO addressed the letter to four House committee leaders: Financial Services Chairman Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., and Oversight Chairman James Comer, R-Ky.Spokespeople for the four chairmen did not immediately respond to CNBC’s requests for comment on Nunes’ letter.The letter comes as the stock price of Trump Media, which created the social media app Truth Social, continues to trend down in volatile trading sessions.DJT shot up in its trading debut and has touched a high of nearly $80 a share, but it has since lost more than half of that value.Trump Media has been described as a meme stock and a “ scam ” by some analysts who are quick to highlight the disparity between the company’s  lack of revenue  and its roughly $5 billion market capitalization.The letter from Nunes also escalates a feud with  Citadel Securities , the capital markets firm founded by GOP megadonor Ken Griffin.Nunes referenced Citadel Securities in an April 18 letter to Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman, warning that DJT “appears on Nasdaq’s ‘Reg SHO threshold list,’ which is indicative of unlawful trading activity.” He referenced Citadel Securities again in the new letter he sent to Congress.The Reg, or Regulation, SHO list was designed to monitor short sales and flag potentially problematic failures to deliver securities to parties in a transaction.

Closing sales are expected to begin Tuesday. The company said hours for remaining stores won’t change and it will continue to accept orders and returns as usual.In a news release, Express said it filed for bankruptcy to “facilitate” a sale process of most of its retail stores and operations to the investor group, which includes WHP,  Simon Property Group  and Brookfield Properties. It received a nonbinding letter of intent from the investors to buy the assets, and has also secured $35 million in new financing from some of its existing lenders, subject to court approval. “The proposed transaction will provide Express with additional financial resources, better position the business for profitable growth and maximize value for the Company’s stakeholders,” Express said. Express also secured $49 million in cash from the IRS related to the CARES Act — a critical influx of liquidity that the company had been waiting on to shore up its balance sheet. “We continue to make meaningful progress refining our product assortments, driving demand, connecting with customers and strengthening our operations,” CEO Stewart Glendinning said in a statement. “We are taking an important step that will strengthen our financial position and enable Express to continue advancing our business initiatives,” he added.The business casual apparel brand, founded in 1980 by Les Wexner’s Limited Brands, has seen sales plummet over the last few years as debt and costly mall leases dragged down its business. Earlier this month, CNBC reported that Express was  struggling to pay its vendors  on time, indicating it was in financial distress and struggling to manage cash flows. When retailers can’t pay their vendors, suppliers sometimes tighten payment terms or refuse to fulfill orders, which can further pressure a company’s liquidity.Last spring, Express  acquired Bonobos’  operating assets and related liabilities for $25 million from  Walmart  in a joint deal with WHP. The deal came as Express’ “core business was weak, and cash was tight,” GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders said in a Monday note.Still, its biggest problem was declining revenue, which has fallen by about 10% since 2019, Saunders said. “This stands in marked contrast to an apparel sector that has grown strongly over the same period. This has put the company under a lot of financial strain and has resulted in some significant losses. None of this is sustainable which is one of the reasons for bankruptcy,” said Saunders.  “The woes at Express are not all of its own making,” he said. “The formal and smart casual market for both men and women has softened over recent years because of a rise from working from home and the casualization of fashion. This puts Express firmly on the wrong side of trends and, in our view, the chain made too little effort to adapt.”Bankruptcy will provide some key relief to Express and help it get back on stronger footing as it works to implement its turnaround strategy. It’ll allow the retailer to get out of costly and burdensome leases, many of which are in struggling malls, and has made the company more attractive to buyers. Powerhouse law firm Kirkland & Ellis, which led Bed Bath & Beyond and many other failed retailers through their bankruptcies, is serving as Express’ legal counsel. Moelis & Co. has been tapped as its investment banker and M3 Partners has signed on as its financial advisor.",2024-04-22 19:36:00 PM EEST,NBC,"Express files for bankruptcy, plans to close nearly 100 stores as investor group looks to save the brand",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/express-files-bankruptcy-plans-close-nearly-100-stores-investor-group-rcna148821
"Hugh Son, CNBC,Melissa Repko, CNBC","Walmart’s  majority-owned fintech startup  One  has begun offering buy now, pay later loans for big-ticket items at some of the retailer’s more than 4,600 U.S. stores, CNBC has learned.The move puts One in direct competition with  Affirm , the BNPL leader and exclusive provider of installment loans for Walmart customers since 2019. It’s a relationship that the Bentonville, Arkansas, retailer  expanded  recently, introducing Affirm as a payment option at Walmart self-checkout kiosks.It also likely signals that a battle is brewing in the store aisles and ecommerce portals of America’s largest retailer. At stake is the role of a wide spectrum of players, from fintech firms to card companies and established banks.One’s push into lending is the clearest sign yet of its ambition to become a financial superapp, a mobile one-stop shop for saving, spending and borrowing money.Since it  burst  onto the scene in 2021, luring  Goldman Sachs  veteran  Omer Ismail  as CEO, the fintech startup has intrigued and threatened a financial landscape dominated by banks — and poached talent from more established lenders and payments firms.But the company, based out of a cramped Manhattan WeWork space, has operated mostly in stealth mode while developing its early  products , including a debit account released in 2022.Now, One is going head-to-head with some of Walmart’s existing partners like Affirm who helped the retail giant generate $648 billion in revenue last year.On a recent visit by CNBC to a New Jersey Walmart location, ads for both One and  Affirm  vied for attention among the Apple products and Android smartphones in the store’s electronics section.Offerings from both One and Affirm were available at checkout, and loans from either provider were available for purchases starting at around $100 and costing as much as several thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of between 10% to 36%, according to their respective websites.Electronics, jewelry, power tools and automotive accessories are eligible for the loans, while groceries, alcohol and weapons are not.Buy now, pay later has gained popularity with consumers for everyday items as well as larger purchases. From January through March of this year, BNPL drove $19.2 billion in online spending, according to Adobe Analytics. That’s a 12% year-over-year increase.Walmart and One declined to comment for this article.<h2>Who stays, who goes?</h2>One’s expanding role at Walmart raises the possibility that the company could force Affirm,  Capital One  and other third parties out of some of the most coveted partnerships in American retail, according to industry experts.“I have to imagine the goal is to have all this stuff, whether it’s a credit card, buy now, pay later loans or remittances, to have it all unified in an app under a single brand, delivered online and through Walmart’s physical footprint,” said  Jason Mikula , a consultant formerly employed at Goldman’s consumer division.Affirm declined to comment about its Walmart partnership.For Walmart, One is part of its broader effort to develop new revenue sources beyond its retail stores in areas including finance and health care, following rival  Amazon’s  playbook with cloud computing and streaming, among other segments. Walmart’s newer businesses have higher margins than retail and are a part of its plan to grow profits faster than sales.In February, Walmart said it was buying TV maker Vizio for  $2.3 billion  to boost its advertising business, another growth area for the retailer.<h2>'Bank of Walmart'</h2>When it comes to finance, One is just Walmart’s latest attempt to break into the banking business. Starting in the 1990s, Walmart made  repeated  efforts to enter the industry through direct ownership of a banking arm, each time getting blocked by lawmakers and industry groups concerned that a “Bank of Walmart” would crush small lenders and squeeze big ones.To sidestep those concerns, Walmart adopted a more arms-length approach this time around. For One, the retailer  created a joint venture  with investment firm firm Ribbit Capital — known for backing fintech firms including  Robinhood,  Credit Karma and Affirm — and staffed the business with executives from across finance.Walmart has not disclosed the size of its investment in One.The startup has said that it makes decisions independent of Walmart, though its board includes Walmart U.S. CEO, John Furner, and its finance chief, John David Rainey.One doesn’t have a banking license, but partners with  Coastal Community Bank  for the debit card and installment loans.After its failed early attempts in banking, Walmart pursued a partnership strategy, teaming up with a constellation of providers, including Capital One,  Synchrony,  MoneyGram,  Green Dot , and more recently, Affirm. Leaning on partners, the retailer opened thousands of physical MoneyCenter locations within its stores to offer check cashing, sending and receiving payments, and tax services.<h2>From paper to pixels</h2>But Walmart and One executives have made no secret of their ambition to become a major player in financial services by leapfrogging existing players with a clean-slate effort.One’s no-fee approach is especially relevant to low- and middle-income Americans who are “underserved financially,” Rainey, a former  PayPal  executive, noted during a December conference.“We see a lot of that customer demographic, so I think it gives us the ability to participate in this space in maybe a way that others don’t,” Rainey said. “We can digitize a lot of the services that we do physically today. One is the platform for that.”One could generate roughly $1.6 billion in annual revenue from debit cards and lending in the near term, and more than $4 billion if it expands into investing and other areas, according to  Morgan Stanley .Walmart can use its scale to grow One in other ways. It is the largest private employer in the U.S. with about 1.6 million employees, and it already offers its workers early access to wages if they sign up for a corporate version of One.<h2>Walmart's next card</h2>There are signs that One is making a deeper push into lending beyond installment loans.Walmart recently  prevailed  in a legal dispute with  Capital One , allowing the retailer to end its credit-card partnership years ahead of schedule. Walmart  sued  Capital One last year, alleging that its exclusive partnership with the card issuer was void after it failed to live up to contractual obligations around customer service, assertions that Capital One denied.The lawsuit led to speculation that Walmart intends to have One take over management of the retailer’s co-branded and store cards. In fact, in legal filings Capital One itself alleged that Walmart’s rationale was less about servicing complaints and more about moving transactions to a company it owns.“Upon information and belief, Walmart intends to offer its branded credit cards through One in the future,” Capital One said last year in response to Walmart’s suit. “With One, Walmart is positioning itself to compete directly with Capital One to provide credit and payment products to Walmart customers.”Capital One said last month that it could  appeal  the decision. The company declined to comment further.Meanwhile, Walmart  said  last year when its lawsuit became public that it would soon announce a new credit card option with “meaningful benefits and rewards.”One has obtained lending licenses that allow it to operate in nearly every U.S. state, according to filings and its  website . The company’s app tells users that credit building and credit score monitoring services are coming soon.<h2>Catching Cash App, Chime</h2>And while One’s expansion threatens to supersede Walmart’s existing financial partners, Walmart’s efforts could also be seen as defensive.Fintech players including  Block’s  Cash App, PayPal and Chime dominate account growth among people who switch bank accounts and have made inroads with Walmart’s core demographic. The three services made up 60% of digital player signups last year, according to data and consultancy firm  Curinos .But One has the advantage of being majority owned by a company whose customers make more than 200 million visits a week.It can offer them enticements including 3% cashback on Walmart purchases and a savings account that pays 5% interest annually, far higher than most banks, according to customer emails from One.Those terms keep customers spending and saving within the Walmart ecosystem and helps the retailer better understand them,  Morgan Stanley  analysts said in a 2022 research note.“One has access to Walmart’s sizable and sticky customer base, the largest in retail,” the analysts wrote. “This captive and underserved customer base gives One a leg up vs. other fintechs.”",2024-04-23 16:31:00 PM EEST,NBC,"Walmart-backed fintech One introduces buy now, pay later as it prepares bigger push into lending",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/walmart-backed-fintech-one-introduces-buy-now-pay-later-prepares-bigge-rcna148944
"Dan Mangan, CNBC","Former President  Donald Trump  is poised to receive an additional 36 million shares of  Trump Media  Tuesday — an “earnout” bonus worth more than $1.25 billion, at Monday’s price.Trump Media, which owns the  Truth Social  app, was trading at around $35 per share mid-day Monday.But that price is twice the $17.50 benchmark minimum share price, which the  DJT  ticker has to hit by the close of trading Tuesday, for Trump to become eligible for the extra so-called  earnout shares .That earnout is contingent on the benchmark being hit for 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period, beginning March 25. Tuesday is the 20th day and it is very unlikely that DJT will fall below the benchmark price by the end of that day.Trump Media’s share price was down about 1.8% as of 12:17 p.m. ETThe 36 million additional for Trump would be added to the 78.75 million shares he already owns, as the company’s majority shareholder.When the earnout shares are added to his existing stock, Trump’s total stake in Trump Media would be worth more than $4 billion on paper, at $35 a share.Trump Media has the power to issue a total of 40 million earnout shares, as part of the merger deal that combined it with a publicly traded shell company, Digital World Acquisition Corp.“Assuming the full issuance of the Earnout Shares, President Donald J. Trump will receive 36,000,000 Earnout Shares,” the company said in a securities filing. The filing suggests that some, if not all, of the remaining shares will be issued to Trump Media’s executive officers as part of an incentive plan.Trump was in a New York City courtroom Monday, listening to opening statements in his criminal hush money trial. Court resumes on Tuesday for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.The merged company, whose full name is Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., began public trading under the DJT ticker on March 26, at an opening price of $70.90 per share.That price rose to a high of nearly $80 that day, briefly giving the company a market capitalization of more than $9 billion. This was despite having reported a 2023 net loss of $58 million, and just $4.1 million in revenue.But since then, Trump Media’s share price has plunged. By the close of trading on April 15, the share price had fallen nearly 68% from its opening price.The stock price rose sharply last week. But as of Monday, Trump Media shares were still trading around 50% lower than the price they debuted at last month, erasing billions of dollars in market capitalization for the company.Even with a much lower stock price, Trump is almost certain to receive all of his earnout shares.That’s because the threshold share price at which Trump will receive all 36 million of his earnout shares was set at $17.50. The last time the stock traded at that price was in January, before the Securities and Exchange Commission greenlighted DWAC and Trump Media’s plans to merge.It remains to be seen if the issuance of the earnout shares to Trump will affect the share price of Trump Media.Any shares that Trump owns are subject to a lock-up provision that prevents him from selling them in the six months following the merger’s closing date.While Trump Media’s board could amend that provision, to date, it has not taken any steps to do so.CNBC asked a company spokeswoman about the expected triggering of Trump’s earnout shares.She replied, “With more than $200 million in the bank and zero debt, Trump Media is fulfilling all its obligations related to the merger and rapidly moving forward with its business plan.”",2024-04-22 21:34:00 PM EEST,NBC,Donald Trump set to receive $1.25 billion worth of Trump Media stock in DJT earnout bonus,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/donald-trump-set-receive-125-billion-trump-media-stock-djt-earnout-bon-rcna148847
"Sahil Kapur,Scott Wong,Allan Smith","WASHINGTON — Tucked inside the sprawling $95 billion national security package that President Joe Biden’s signed Wednesday is a provision that could ban TikTok, with an important catch: It won’t happen before the 2024 election.That means TikTok, which boasts 170 million American users, will remain a force throughout the campaign, providing a platform for candidates to reach predominantly younger voters. An earlier version of the bill could have banned the popular video-sharing app prior to the election, but recent changes mean lawmakers and Biden may not face such an immediate voter backlash.The new  legislation  provides nine months for TikTok’s Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United States. The president can grant a one-time extension of 90 days, bringing the timeline to sell to one year, if he certifies that there’s a path to divestiture and “significant progress” toward executing it.Even without the extension, the earliest a ban could start is January 2025. With the extension, it would be April. And with TikTok threatening legal action, the matter could get  tied up in the courts  for even longer. It’s a shift from an earlier House-passed bill that included a six-month window that could have triggered a TikTok ban before the November election.A senior Republican aide said Democrats were responsible for the change. “Senate Democrats had been pretty consistent about wanting to extend that timeline,” the aide said.The election was “definitely” something “conveniently addressed” by the new deadline, said a Democratic source close to the issue.Other Democrats are assuring voters that ByteDance would sooner sell TikTok than risk a U.S. ban, a view some  experts disagree with .“TikTok ain’t going away. There is no more capitalistic entity than an organization controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. They’re going to sell it,” said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., a member of the Armed Services Committee, who faces re-election this fall. “Young people will go on their TikTok tomorrow and they’ll still have it. And then the day after that, they’ll still have it. And the day after that, they’ll still have it,” Kaine said, adding that the only difference is it would be American-owned. “If you like it, you’re going to keep it.”In endorsing the revised TikTok bill, Senate Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., said that extending ByteDance’s divestment period — what she called her “recommendation” — would help ensure there is “enough time for a new buyer to get a deal done.”Other lawmakers who helped negotiate that change, including Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., agreed that the reason they pushed back the deadline was to improve the chances of a sale.“This gives more time to make the divestment achievable,” said Krishnamoorthi, the top Democrat on the special committee investigating the CCP. “It made a lot of sense. That’s why, as you could tell, we didn’t lose any votes because of the change. In fact, we gained some votes — we went from 352 to 360 votes in the House.”TikTok gave no indication that it would consider divesting, with a spokesperson saying in a statement: “This unconstitutional law is a TikTok ban, and we will challenge it in court.”<h2>Trump, who tried his own ban, tells 'the young people' to blame Biden</h2>Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, sought to exploit a ban politically.“Just so everyone knows, especially the young people, Crooked Joe Biden is responsible for banning TikTok,” Trump  said  on social media. “He is the one pushing it to close … Young people, and lots of others, must remember this on November 5th, ELECTION DAY, when they vote!”It's a flip-flop for the former president, who signed an  executive order  in August 2020 to ban TikTok in 45 days if it was not sold. His statement cited “the threat posed” by China with its ability under Chinese law to force the app to grant access to Americans’ data and its potential to manipulate the algorithm to advance Chinese propaganda — the same reasons Congress and Biden favor a ban.But the executive order was blocked in court, and the app persisted.“I have every expectation that TikTok will be alive and well, no matter who is president,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. “Donald Trump is obviously trying to turn it into an election issue, but considering he was in favor of banning it, I think his warning is more baloney to use a polite word.”Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said opinions about TikTok and social media won’t “rival choice and democracy and immigration as a voting issue” in the 2024 election.But Murphy said the political implications cut both ways.“I am part of a group of pissed-off parents that feel that they’ve lost control of their kids’ lives. There’s undoubtedly another group of kids who are worried that they’re going to lose access to social media in the way that they have it now,” Murphy said. “But those are two very distinct voting groups and if you ignore the perils of social media, maybe you pick up some younger voters, but you lose some parents. So this is one of these issues where you have to see the full picture.”Rep. Summer Lee, D-Pa., who voted against the TikTok ban over the weekend, said in an interview that there is a need to solve the national security and data concerns associated with the platform but added that banning TikTok would be disastrous for creators, organizers and activists.“I think this is a case of throwing the baby out with the bathwater, where we have people, communities that are able to organize, that are able to meet, that are able to find space for their businesses to grow"" on TikTok, she said. “We need to actually think about what the consequences of that are, not political consequences alone, but the consequences holistically.”<h2>'The battle lines aren't really clear'</h2>A Republican working on Senate races said being tough on TikTok would have been an easier message to drive home in the campaign before Trump himself came out against the ban.“It used to be a lot more straightforward,” this person said of how they could message against Democrats who use TikTok to campaign — which, despite Biden's intention to sign the ban legislation,  includes  his  campaign . “But Trump is on the other side now. It makes the whole thing a little murkier. The battle lines aren’t really clear.”Still, the Republican believes that a looming ban could have a big impact on the campaign trail for Democrats who use TikTok, saying candidates are using it exclusively as a tool to reach voters.“It’s really clear they think it’s an important tool in their toolbox,” this person said.In front-line battleground Senate states, Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, and Bob Casey, of Pennsylvania, have accounts on the platform. So, too, do Democratic Reps. Ruben Gallego, of Arizona, and Colin Allred, of Texas, both running for Senate seats in competitive races this fall. All four voted in favor of the legislation that included the potential TikTok ban.Speaking with the Rev. Al Sharpton on MSNBC’s “PoliticsNation” on Sunday, Casey expressed hope the legislation would spur TikTok’s parent company to sell its American assets to a U.S. owner. “I don’t think any American wants to put our country further at risk when it comes to China,” he said, adding, “I know a lot of Americans rely upon TikTok, and that’s understandable because of the value that it can provide to a small-business owner or others who need TikTok to communicate.""Brown’s campaign declined to comment. Campaigns for Gallego and Allred did not respond to requests for comment.Biden's campaign said only that the campaign is on TikTok, without saying whether it would remain on it, and noted that the president doesn't have an official account on the platform.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., asked late Tuesday about a potential backlash to the TikTok crackdown, said: “Speaker Johnson put it in bill — the big supplemental bill. We had to get the supplemental bill passed as quickly as possible.”Some of Biden's allies disagree with him on a TikTok prohibition.Progressive Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., a Biden campaign surrogate, said he opposes a TikTok ban, citing free speech rights.“The longer timeline helps marginally in pushing the ban until after the election and the bill, in any case, is likely to get struck down by the courts,” he said. “But rushing to pass it shows the complete disconnect between the Beltway establishment and many Americans.”Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., offered some advice for election candidates navigating a voter backlash to a TikTok ban: “I would tell them to follow their heart but take their brain with them.”",2024-04-24 12:00:00 PM EEST,NBC,Biden signs a bill that could ban TikTok — after the 2024 election,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/congress-biden-bill-ban-tiktok-when-2024-election-rcna148792
Erika Edwards,"Warnings about  fake Botox injections  given by people not trained to give the shots are growing. On Friday, the  New York City Health Department  said that three people have had to go to emergency departments after getting injections of botulinum toxin in their face, neck, upper back or armpits.Within days or weeks of getting the shots, the three developed a range of symptoms, from double vision and drooping eyelids to difficulty swallowing, breathing and raising their arms.Two were hospitalized, and one needed to be admitted to an intensive care unit.  The new insights come as both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration investigate other cases of people who’ve had to be hospitalized with potentially severe side effects after getting fake Botox shots from unlicensed providers.On Friday, the CDC reported that  at least 22 people in 11 states  have had bad reactions, including slurred speech, trouble breathing and blurry vision, after receiving counterfeit versions of the wrinkle-smoothing treatment. Eleven of those patients were hospitalized, the CDC said, and six were treated with No deaths have been reported. Of 20 people with information available, 11 (55%) people were hospitalized and 6 (27%) were treated with botulism antitoxin because of concerns that the botulinum toxin could have spread beyond the injection site. Of seven people tested for botulism, six people had negative results. Results are pending for one person.All reports came from people identifying as females, ranging in age from 25 to 59 years, with a median age of 41 years. Twenty (91%) people reported receiving botulinum toxin injections for cosmetic purposes. All people reported receiving these injections from unlicensed or untrained individuals or in non-healthcare settings, including homes and spas.All are women between the ages of 25 and 59, most around age 40. The women had received the shots in “non-healthcare settings,” such as homes and spas, the CDC said. Reports of symptoms possibly related to the fake Botox were first reported in early November 2023.“People should not be getting injections from friends or at parties,” NYC Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan said in a  press release  Friday. “A price that is too good to be true, or if a service provider does not explain the risks and side effects of the procedure, are clear warning signs that the products or services may not be legitimate and could pose a risk to your health.”The  FDA  said that there’s no indication that authentic Botox, from the drugmaker AbbVie, is linked to any of the illnesses.The drug uses a purified form of a neurotoxin called botulinum toxin that causes muscle paralysis. Injected in precise amounts into specific areas of the face, it can relax muscles that cause wrinkles.In an email to NBC News, the FDA said that it’s “actively working” with state and federal health authorities to investigate the source of counterfeit Botox.“The question is, is this ‘faux-tox’ all one and the same?” asked Dr. Adam Friedman, a dermatologist and chair of dermatology at George Washington University. “Or are multiple people creating different versions of it? We don’t know the answer to that.”Dr. Kate Dee, a physician and founder of Glow Medispa in Seattle, blamed the recent illnesses on  unregulated medical spas , which have ballooned in recent years, becoming a  $15 billion  wellness industry. “The problem is not that there’s fake Botox around and doctors might accidentally use it. That’s not what’s happening. Doctors get real Botox, and we pay lots of money to do things legally and legitimately,” she said. “It’s these people who are busy trying to make money from the med spa industry, the esthetics industry, who are getting it because it’s so much cheaper.”Cases linked to counterfeit Botox have been detected so far in California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. At least 11 patients have been hospitalized, according to the CDC.Some symptoms, such as blurred vision and drooping eyelids, appeared near the injection site, while others were more widespread, including fatigue and generalized weakness.Other potentially concerning symptoms could include constipation, incontinence, dry mouth and difficulty lifting the head, the FDA said.The difference in side effects from fake BotoxUsually, adverse events related to real Botox injections are the result of “poor technique,” such as injecting the toxin into the wrong muscle or in the wrong location, Friedman said.“But if these patients might be going into respiratory distress or failure because of systemic poisoning,” he said, “that’s different from what doctors usually see.”The FDA said there are several ways to identify counterfeit Botox products:Dee recommends that patients ask to see the vial of toxin before getting the shots. “At the very least, look at the vial because if it’s in any other language besides English, it’s not real Botox.”",2024-04-19 23:45:00 PM EEST,NBC,"Where is the 'faux-tox' coming from?

"Sahil Kapur,Frank Thorp V,Monica Alba,Summer Concepcion","WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Wednesday signed into law a  $95 billion package  to provide critical  aid to Ukraine  and enact   a provision that could lead to a nationwide  ban on T ikTok .""It’s going to make America safer, it’s gonna make the world safer, and it continues America’s leadership in the world, and everyone knows gives vital support to America’s partners,"" Biden said Wednesday in remarks praising the package's passage. ""And so they can defend themselves against threats to their sovereignty.""The Senate passed the long-awaited foreign aid package Tuesday in a 79-18 vote. Fifteen Republicans and three Democrats voted against the legislation. The House passed the package on Saturday.Biden on Wednesday acknowledged the time it took for the bill to gain the bipartisan support it needed to pass.“It was a difficult path,” he said. “It should have been easier and it should have gotten there sooner. But in the end, we did what America always does: We rose to the moment, came together and we got it done.”Biden condemned Russian President Vladimir Putin while stressing the urgency of providing aid to Ukraine, saying that in the next few hours the U.S. will begin sending equipment to the country from its own stockpiles and then will replace those stockpiles with new American-made products that include patriot missiles and artillery shells.“In other words, we’re helping Ukraine while at the same time investing in our own industrial base, strengthening our own national security, supporting jobs in nearly 40 states all across America,” he said.“America stands with our friends, we stand up against dictators,” he added. “We bow to no one, to no one. Certainly not Vladimir Putin.”Biden reiterated his stance that Israel has a right to defend itself in its war against Hamas and that the foreign aid package he signed into law will allow the U.S. to help replenish Israel’s air defense and provide other critical aid in an effort to prevent attacks similar to the strikes carried out by Iran this month.The president noted that the foreign aid package also provides $1 billion of additional humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza, which he said would allow the U.S. to send food, medical supplies and clean water to the region.Biden said border security should have been in the package and vowed to “come back to that in another moment, another time.”The president concluded his remarks without mentioning the package's crackdown on TikTok.The package   includes $60 billion in aid to Ukraine that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said would give his country “ a chance at victory ” against Russia. It also includes $26 billion in assistance to Israel and humanitarian relief in Gaza, in addition to $8 billion for security in Taiwan and the Indo-Pacific.And it will give TikTok’s China-based parent company nine months, which the president could extend to a year, to sell the popular social media platform or be banned in the U.S. That puts TikTok closer than ever before to a prohibition while ensuring that it won’t be banned until after the  2024 election . TikTok has said it will fight the law in court once it is signed into law.“Finally, finally, finally. Tonight after more than six months of hard work, and many twists and turns in the road, America sends a message to the entire world: We will not turn our back on you,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on the Senate floor moments before the vote.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., heralded Tuesday as “an important day for America” after months of GOP infighting over whether to keep funding Ukraine. McConnell said “we’ve turned the corner on the isolationist movement” and  attributed the delay to two men : former Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson for his “demonization of Ukraine” and former President Donald Trump for his “mixed views” and earlier resistance to helping the country.In pressing for the legislation, Biden directed his team to follow a strategy of sticking to substance, not politics, to get Ukraine aid over the finish line, an administration official said. That included staying in close contact with House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and his staff and laying off targeted attacks against him as much as possible while broadly urging House Republicans to act. It also mean emphasizing the intelligence picture and the national security risks of inaction for America, the official said. Steve Ricchetti, a counselor to the president, said Biden's meeting with congressional leaders at the White House in February ""really charted the course, and we left saying we have to get this done. Let’s deepen the dialogue about what we’re going to do to get there.” Ricchetti added of Biden's role in the negotiations, “One of his superpowers is figuring out how to get these things done.”Two months ago,  the Senate voted 70-29  to pass a similar $95 billion foreign aid package — but without the TikTok provision. Still, the Senate proved   receptive to the TikTok ban bill, which the House revised. An earlier House-passed bill would have given the parent company six months to sell TikTok, less than the current one.Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., the chair of the Commerce Committee, endorsed the new bill, saying she’s “very happy” with the extended window for TikTok to be sold. Cantwell noted that she recommended the change.""I support this updated legislation,"" she said.Advocates for banning the app in the U.S. express concerns about TikTok’s relationship to ByteDance, a company based in Beijing, saying Americans’ data could, under Chinese law, be accessed by China’s government, a prospect that TikTok has downplayed, saying its headquarters are in Singapore and Los Angeles. They also claim China could manipulate the algorithm to advance propaganda.A TikTok spokesperson responded to the House’s vote over the weekend by saying, “It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24 billion to the U.S. economy annually.” A source within TikTok shared an internal memo sent after the House passed the bill that said that once Biden signs it into law, it ""will move to the courts for a legal challenge.""Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, lobbied his colleagues to reject the package, saying 41 senators could join to filibuster it.“The $95 billion bill doesn’t have to pass. It takes only 41 senators stop it,” Lee  wrote on X . “There are 49 Republicans in the Senate—more than enough. Where do your senators stand?”In the end, he fell far short.",2024-04-23 14:00:00 PM EEST,NBC,"Biden signs Ukraine aid, Israel funding and TikTok crackdown into law",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-hold-key-test-vote-ukraine-aid-israel-funding-tiktok-ban-rcna148685
"Sahil Kapur,Owen Hayes","WASHINGTON — Thousands of fans lined up along Pennsylvania Avenue on Saturday for the thrill of  watching a Formula 1  race winner blast down the iconic street in a championship-winning car.The event was hosted on a breezy spring afternoon by reigning F1 champions Oracle   Red Bull Racing as part of a series of events in American cities designed to bring the world’s fastest race cars closer to the  sport’s fastest - growing fan   base .The main event featured F1 race winner and former Red Bull driver David Coulthard. Coulthard, a retired driver who goes by “DC,” raced the RB7 car  —  in which Sebastian Vettel won the 2011 title  —  down the street between the Capitol and the White House, the same area that gets blocked off for presidential inaugurations. Crowds packed the spectator zones for a good view, cheering and smelling burned rubber as Coulthard hit the throttle in a car that goes over 200 mph, some of them covering their ears as the engine revved up. “It’s exciting!” said Ron Binkauskas, who flew to Washington from Kentucky and watched in the VIP zone. “You don’t realize from TV just how fast these cars are and how loud they are.”Coulthard told NBC News that he was most excited to drive alongside “the iconic images” of Washington and that he would “love” to see an F1 street race in the nation’s capital.“For many years, Formula 1 under its previous management tried to sort of find a foothold in America to have a true world championship. America is such an important and powerful country,” Coulthard said. “The American owners, Liberty [Media], have understood very well the American market ... and they’ve opened it up and made the paddock more accessible. I think, previously, the sport was quite sort of elitist and had the barriers up. And it was very difficult for people to connect. But that has really changed, and the audience has just gone [up].”James Smith, who lives in Washington, took some time off work to see the show — and to see an F1 car in person for the first time.“I’m just a fan of the Red Bull team, and it’s not every day that they come to this part of town. So it’s something I want to see,” he said.Smith got into F1 by watching ""Drive to Survive"" on Netflix. ""I watched it during Covid a lot with some of my friends,"" he said. ""And Red Bull was really heavily featured. So that’s how I got into the team.”“Drive to Survive,” the popular documentary that premiered in 2019, is widely credited, including by F1 drivers and team bosses, for fueling the sport’s growth and bringing in more American fans.But this year is a crucial time for the sport in the U.S., a test of whether it can keep growing — or even sustain its new fans.From 2018 to 2023,  ESPN s ays , viewership doubled from 554,000 to 1.11 million per race. But last year, it ticked down slightly from its peak of 1.21 million in 2022, which the network attributed in part to the record-smashing inaugural Miami Grand Prix that year.One of the goals of the sport is to make it more accessible.Red Bull’s two-day event included a zone nearby Friday and Saturday for fans to test out the Red Bull “simulators,” which the drivers use to hone their craft, to practice pit stops by changing tires the way the professionals do at races and to buy merch. Along with Red Bull race suits, plenty of fans were decked out in gear of other F1 teams — most notably Ferrari and McLaren.They included Corey Jean Gartenhaus, of Washington, whose favorite driver is Lando Norris of McLaren.“I actually had a calendar invite on my calendar today blocked off, and it said that I’m going to F1 DC. And my boss was like, that’s really awesome,” she said. “You watch it on TV and to feel it in real life and feel the vibrations of the engine and everything like that, it’s just a very different experience.”The event brought out old and new Formula 1 fans, too.“I am one of the biggest Formula 1 and racing fans, and this is one of the biggest events that we’ve had in the District,” said Charles Kurtis, who has worked at go-kart tracks in the Washington area.Sebastian Fleischer, a racing driver and motorsports fan in Maryland, said he has been a Formula 1 fan “forever” — at least since Michael Schumacher was dominating in a Ferrari two decades ago.“It’s really great to see how much growth and how big the sport has gotten in the United States, having three Grand Prix now,” he said, referring to the races in Miami; Austin, Texas; and Las Vegas — more than any other country hosts.Kiani Parvizi, a self-described “Ferrari girl” who is a fan of Charles Leclerc, said she brought her roommate to the event because “I wanted to show my roommate what the F1 world was like and hopefully get her to watch a couple races.”The showrun took place the day Red Bull’s defending F1 champion, Max Verstappen, scored the team’s 100th pole position ahead of the Chinese Grand Prix. Verstappen is dominating the sport, having won a record 19 of 22 races last year and three of the first four races this year. Although longtime F1 fans have learned to love the sport through eras of dominance — which never last — many newer fans have not. They want to see competition.Coulthard said he takes “the view that sport is about being the best” and that periods of dominance are inevitable when one team gets it right. But he said Americans have plenty of reasons to love F1.“This represents the very best and technology,” Coulthard said. “And if we look at the world we live in today, most people have a mobile phone or a laptop, and of course you want the latest and greatest because it just enhances your performance experience. What you have in Formula 1 is the fastest, most technologically advanced racing car series in the world.”",2024-04-21 04:06:00 AM EEST,NBC,Red Bull Formula 1 team turns Washington's iconic Pennsylvania Ave into a racetrack,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/red-bull-formula-1-dc-pennsylvania-ave-race-rcna148446
"Maggie Vespa,Samira Puskar,Erik Ortiz","FLINT, Mich. — Ten years ago, smiling politicians posed for cameras while pushing a button, swapping the main tap water source for this majority-Black, impoverished city to the Flint River — the untreated water that started flowing from residents’ taps would become contaminated when it corroded the pipes. For years afterward, the  city’s water was tainted with lead , a human-made crisis that became emblematic of how poorer communities of color in the United States could fall victim to government mismanagement.In that time, Michigan started and then stopped providing  free bottled water to Flint residents ;  criminal charges were brought  and then  dismissed  against several officials for deaths suspected of being linked to the scandal; and a lawsuit was  settled with the state in 2021  for $626 million, but residents have yet to receive a dime.Now, Mayor Sheldon Neeley contends the city’s work to ensure a Flint free from contaminated drinking water is finally on the “last leg” of the process — a promise that comes as families continue to live with lingering adverse health effects and demand ongoing accountability.“We have new infrastructure. We have new state-of-the-art technologies,” he said.“Residents of this community never again have to worry about drinking from the Flint River water,” Neeley added.Since the crisis unfolded, almost 30,000 homes and businesses have had their water service lines investigated and replaced, he said. Efforts will resume this week to inspect the lines at almost three dozen more structures, although about 1,900 others have not been reviewed.A federal judge last month held Flint in contempt of court for missing deadlines related to replacing service lines, writing that “the city has failed to abide by the court’s orders in several respects” and adding that “it has no good reason for its failures.” Meanwhile groups, including the  Natural Resources Defense Council, accuse the city  of dragging its feet.Neeley said the city has been unable to move forward on those outstanding properties because their owners have not granted access. But activists claim it’s the city that isn’t making the effort to contact them.“As a resident myself, I’m making sure that we do the things necessary to reach out,” said Neeley, who was elected mayor in 2019 and re-elected in 2022. “Those individuals that said they never received a knock at the door, they can also make an outreach to the city of Flint.”“We’re working every day,” he added, “and everything doesn’t happen overnight.”But a decade should be more than enough time, Flint residents argue.“It’s been the residents, the poisoned people, on the front lines this entire fight,” said Melissa Mays, a social worker and activist. “It’s been exhausting because it’s ongoing.”<h2>‘A historic moment’</h2>On April 25, 2014, then-Mayor Dayne Walling and other officials  toasted with glasses of water to celebrate  switching from Detroit’s water system to the Flint River, part of a cost-cutting move that was estimated to save the cash-strapped city about $5 million in less than two years.Tapping from the Flint River was meant to be an interim source until Flint could join a new system accessing water from Lake Huron.“It’s a historic moment for the city of Flint to return to its roots and use our own river as our drinking water supply,” Walling said at the ceremony, marking the switch with the press of a black button.But in the following weeks, residents complained that the water tasted “weird,” with a murky, foamy appearance as it flowed from the tap.While the mayor insisted residents who were concerned about the water quality were wasting their money buying bottled water, a boil advisory was eventually issued after the water tested positive for E.coli bacteria. Residents began to protest. The city continued to claim the water was safe, even as a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency manager told the state that the chemistry of the Flint River allowed for contaminants from pipes, including lead, to leach into the water system.In the summer of 2015, Virginia Tech researchers found samples of Flint water had abnormally high lead levels. Exposure to lead can be harmful to children,  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , potentially causing slowed growth and development, behavioral problems, and brain and nervous system damage.The fallout in Flint included a federal government investigation, the resignation of then-Gov. Rick Snyder’s environmental chief and the city’s return to using Detroit water. Meanwhile, amid the crisis, Flint also grappled with a  Legionnaires’ disease outbreak  that led to a dozen deaths and scrutiny over whether the severe form of bacterial pneumonia was connected with the city’s water supply. (A  2019 study  prompted by the state of Michigan found the outbreak may be associated with the Flint water emergency but that, regardless, there was an ineffective public health response to the Legionnaires’ cases.) In 2016, the administration of then-President Barack Obama declared a federal emergency in Flint and freed up millions in water infrastructure aid. By the end of that year, researchers said they found that lead-tainted water was not in most homes.There is a “great irony” that despite all the attention that Flint brought to lead-contaminated tap water — and the wider issue of environmental justice — the city has not completed the work of installing new service lines, said Erik Olson, senior strategic director for health and food with the Natural Resources Defense Council.“The local government just keeps making up excuses for why they haven’t solved the problem,” he said. “We need to turn that around and fix the problem now in Flint and take steps to fix the problem nationwide.”He added: “They’re within fighting distance of finishing the job.”<h2>‘Still suffering’</h2>Mays, the Flint social worker, has been an outspoken critic of the local and state governments’ handling of the water crisis. The realization that some of the children she works with have gone their entire lives being unable or unwilling to drink from the tap is “angering.”“The fact that it’s been allowed to drag on for a decade while people suffer and pass away — we’ve lost a lot of amazing people,” she said. “It’s inhumane.”Mays said she blames the lead in Flint water for medical and learning challenges her three sons, now 19, 21 and 25, have faced over the past decade, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, anxiety, damage to their kidneys and growth plates, as well as immune system issues.“We didn’t have discolored water,” she said, “so we just assumed it was safe.”Mays joined others in her community to protest, and in 2016 became a named plaintiff in a lawsuit accusing Flint of violating the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. A settlement was reached for the city to replace the lead service lines. Meanwhile, the state’s financial payouts to tens of thousands of Flint residents remain mired in delays.“We still have yet to have proper justice,” said Mays’ youngest son, Cole Mays, who grew up with a regular routine of getting his lead levels checked.His mother added that water woes in recent years in other economically disadvantaged and majority-Black cities, including  Newark, New Jersey,  and  Jackson, Mississippi,  indicate a larger problem, but the failures in Flint and the slow-going repairs underscore how her city is “still suffering.”Within the last decade, “everybody stood up for us and fought for Flint. We need that again because without that external pressure, it’s going to be another 10 years and then another and another,” Mays said, “and it’s terrifying.”Maggie Vespa and Samira Puskar reported from Flint and Erik Ortiz from New York.",2024-04-24 21:54:00 PM EEST,NBC,"10 years after Flint's lead water crisis began, a lack of urgency stalls 'proper justice'",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/10-years-flints-lead-water-crisis-was-discovered-lack-urgency-stalls-p-rcna148972

Rob Wile,"The Biden administration has issued a nationwide ban on the ability of employers to make their workers sign noncompete agreements, a move regulators said would help boost employee pay but which is set to be challenged in court by business groups.In a ruling Tuesday afternoon, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said noncompete clauses would henceforth be illegal. The measure was necessary, it said, for ""protecting the fundamental freedom of workers to change jobs, increasing innovation, and fostering new business formation.""“Noncompete clauses keep wages low, suppress new ideas, and rob the American economy of dynamism,” said FTC chair Lina M. Khan in a statement. “The FTC’s final rule to ban noncompetes will ensure Americans have the freedom to pursue a new job, start a new business, or bring a new idea to market.”The FTC estimates nearly one in five Americans are subject to noncompetes. They have grown increasingly common in lower wage or hourly work industries like fast food franchises, restaurants, and security firms, where some employers have sought to limit the ability of workers to effectively raise their pay by looking for work at competing establishments.   In addition to banning all new noncompetes, the FTC's rule applies to all existing noncompete agreements. Employers will now have to provide notice to workers bound to a current noncompete that it will not be enforced against them.The rule was hailed by labor groups and left-leaning policy experts.""Noncompetes are about reducing competition, full stop. It’s in their name,"" said Heidi Shierholz, president of the progressive nonprofit Economic Policy Institute. ""Noncompetes are bad for workers, bad for consumers, and bad for the broader economy. This rule is an important step in creating an economy that is not only strong but also works for working people.""The AFL-CIO, America's largest labor group, praised the new rule in a post on X Tuesday, saying noncompete agreements ""trap workers from finding better jobs, drive down wages, and stifle competition.""But business groups are already hitting out at the ban, saying noncompetes are essential to protecting trade secrets and proprietary information. The groups also say noncompetes ultimately help workers by engendering a more collaborative firm environment and limiting so-called ""free riders,"" or employees who  seek to capitalize on a specific company's methods and taking that knowledge elsewhere.  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the country’s largest business lobby, said it plans to sue the FTC over the ruling.  In a statement , it called the ban an ""unlawful power grab.""“This decision sets a dangerous precedent for government micromanagement of business and can harm employers, workers, and our economy,"" it said. Separately. a Dallas-based tax services firm filed a lawsuit in Texas federal court — which has proven hostile to Biden administration rulings — challenging not only the ban but the very structure of the FTC itself. ""We stand firm in our commitment to serve the rightful interest of every company to retain its proprietary formulas for success taught in good faith to its own employees,” said chairman and CEO G. Brint Ryan said in a statement. The FTC's rule is set to go into effect in August, but is unlikely to be enforced until the court challenges are resolved, something that could take years.

Tillis' comments come after Greene has criticized the House's move to pass a long-stalled  foreign aid bill . The $95 billion bill, which was passed by the Senate on Tuesday and signed by President Joe Biden on Wednesday, includes aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan as well as provisions that could bring about a national ban on the popular video-sharing app  TikTok .The package sets aside $60 billion in aid to Ukraine, $26 billion for Israel and humanitarian relief in Gaza. An additional $8 billion would go toward security in Taiwan and around the Indo-Pacific. The new legislation would also give TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell the platform or be banned in the U.S., a time frame that Biden could extend to a year.Greene did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment on Tillis' remarks. She has adamantly opposed further aid to Ukraine, calling Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., a  ""traitor to our country""  after the House passed the bill and introducing a  motion  to oust him as  speaker  for his role in advancing the funding.

Ryan J. Reilly,"WASHINGTON — A former Republican candidate who lost his race for mayor in Connecticut last year was sentenced   Wednesday to 10 days of incarceration for his role in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Gino DiGiovanni Jr. admitted he entered the Capitol after  NBC Connecticut confronted him in October 2022  after he was identified by online ""sedition hunters"" who have aided hundreds of cases against Capitol rioters. “I wouldn’t want to be arrested for it,”  DiGiovanni said  at the time. “I guess hindsight is 20/20.”DiGiovanni was  arrested in August . He  reached a plea agreement  last year and  pleaded guilty  to a misdemeanor in January.Prosecutors cited NBC Connecticut's interview with DiGiovanni in seeking a sentence of 30 days behind bars, saying it was clear that DiGiovanni was not remorseful when he was shown the evidence. ""When DiGiovanni was confronted with pictures of himself inside the Capitol by a member of the press in 2022, DiGiovanni acknowledged his presence in the Capitol on January 6 but did not express remorse for his part in the riot at the Capitol, even as a sitting elected official at the time of the interview,""  prosecutors wrote . ""Thirty days of incarceration for that conviction is amply warranted here: DiGiovanni entered the United States Capitol building despite obvious signs that he should not (including OC-spray in the air, verbal attacks hurled at police, and blaring alarms); he remained in the Capitol for over twenty minutes and then stayed even longer on Capitol Grounds to celebrate the mob’s breach of the Capitol building; and he has failed express real remorse or recognition of the import of his actions from that day,"" they wrote.At the hearing Wednesday before Chief U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg, Assistant U.S. Attorney Katherine Boyles played a video that showed DiGiovanni at the chaotic scene on the west front of the U.S. Capitol, as well as near a window by the Senate side doors where the mob first breached the building. ""This isn't some ordinary trespass,"" she said, highlighting what DiGiovanni was seeing and hearing when he made the choice to enter the building.A defense attorney said DiGiovanni's business had suffered because of the charges and asked Boasberg to show leniency.""When looking through a lens of Mr. DiGiovanni’s good deeds throughout his entire life, it is evident that they outweigh this one bad one. In addition to serving on the Derby Board of Aldermen/women and the Derby Planning and Zoning Commission, Mr. DiGiovanni ran as Republican candidate for mayor in the fall of 2022,""  his attorney wrote . ""It is safe to say that this became very difficult for Mr. DiGiovanni, due to the negative impact from this case. Mr. DiGiovanni has faced and continues to face ridicule, as well as many other repercussions from that one bad deed on January 6th, 2021.""In the three years since Jan. 6, prosecutors have charged over 1,387 Capitol attack defendants and secured more than 984 convictions and more than 520 sentences of incarceration, from a few days behind bars to  22 years in federal prison .

Bridget Bowman,"The race between President Joe Biden and Donald Trump has been  incredibly stable , but a quarter of all voters are still open to changing their minds on the candidate they plan to support, according to newly released  results from the latest national NBC News poll . With more than six months until Election Day, 26% of registered voters say there is a chance they could vote for a different presidential candidate come November, while 66% of those surveyed say they have made up their minds. Almost the same share of voters currently backing Biden (81%) or Trump (78%) also say they do not plan to change their vote. But many voters who support third-party candidates right now are open to picking a different contender. That includes 61% of voters who say they support independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (Kennedy garnered support from 13% of those surveyed in  a hypothetical matchup  with Biden, Trump, Green Party candidate Jill Stein and independent candidate Cornel West.) “It’s not like he’s capturing, really, hearts and minds,” Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates said of Kennedy. Horwitt conducted the survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies. “It’s the opposite of that,” Horwitt said. “He’s capturing the dissatisfaction that these voters have toward the other two options.” The share of voters who could change their minds is consistent with recent election cycles at similar points in the year. In March 2020, for example, 32% of likely voters said in a  Grinnell College national poll  conducted by J. Ann Selzer that they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate.But it is still notable that a quarter of voters said they could change their minds, since both Trump and Biden are already extremely well known. Just 10% had neutral feelings about Biden and 9% about Trump, and just a few of the 1,000 registered voters surveyed said they did not know the candidates’ names or were not sure how they felt about them. This year, voters who say they are open to changing their minds tend to be younger, particularly younger women, independents and voters who have negative feelings about both Trump and Biden.  About 4 in 10 voters ages 18 to 34 say they could change their vote, along with 37% of women ages 18-49. These voters are also slightly more likely to be people of color, with 32% of Hispanic voters saying they could change their minds, followed by 29% of Black voters and 25% of white voters. The group of voters who say they could change their minds include a higher share of independents (37%) compared to Republicans (25%) and Democrats (38%). And the group also includes 39% of voters who say they voted in the GOP presidential primary for someone other than Trump, and 60% of voters who say they “somewhat disapprove” of Biden’s job as president.  The NBC News poll of 1,000 registered voters nationwide — 891 contacted via cellphone — was conducted April 12-16 and has an overall margin of error of plus-minus 3.1 percentage points.  ",2024-04-24 23:00:00 PM EEST,NBC,NBC News poll: One in 4 voters could change their minds on presidential race,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/nbc-news-poll-one-four-voters-change-minds-presidential-race-rcna149039

Plus, chief political analyst Chuck Todd examines the impacts a disinterested electorate could have on the 2024 race.Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.What’s in a name? Trump’s legal team faces an unusual balancing actDonald Trump has been called a lot of names in the first six days of his New York hush-money trial.“We will call him ‘President Trump’ out of respect for the office that he held from 2017 to 2021,” Trump lawyer Todd Blanche told the jury Monday. “And as everybody knows, it’s the office he’s running for right now. He’s the Republican nominee.”Do you have a news tip?  Let us know Longtime tabloid publisher David Pecker, who testified that he conspired with Trump in 2015 and 2016 to “catch and kill” stories that could harm Trump’s election effort, told the court that when they spoke, “I would call him Donald.”Judge Juan Merchan greeted the former president Tuesday with a standard address for a defendant: “Good morning, Mr. Trump.” That’s also been the form favored by prosecutors.The what’s-in-a-name question is just one of the unusual aspects of the first criminal trial of a former American president, but it points to tension points for Trump and his defense team.Blanche has a tough balancing act between the audience of one at the defense table and the audience of 12 in the jury box — and between Trump as the most powerful man in America at one time and as a common defendant now. Trump demands that his employees refer to him as “president,” which is not uncommon for former presidents.But there are other reasons for Trump’s lawyers to call him that. For one, his broader legal and public relations strategy for the more consequential federal charges facing him relies on an argument that he should be immune from prosecution for acts undertaken as president. And while the New York defense team would surely like for jurors to conclude that Trump was too powerful to be bothered by the details of how an aide was repaid for silencing a porn star, Blanche suggested he is cognizant of the risk that a jury could be alienated if the defendant seems to think he is above the peers assigned to judge him.After explaining why he would call Trump “the president,” Blanche immediately sought to frame his client as a normal guy.“But — and this is important — he’s not just our former president. He’s not just Donald Trump that you’ve seen on TV and read about and seen photos of,” Blanche said. “He’s also a man. He’s a husband. He’s a father. And he’s a person, just like you and just like me.”Trump may be the most recognizable man on Earth. And yet the jurors will have to decide whether this Trump, by any other name, would be as guilty or not guilty.Read more here →<h2>Will voters wake up by Election Day?</h2>The latest  NBC News poll  contains an alarming result. We asked a question that we ask every election year — on a scale of 1-10, how interested are you in the upcoming election? And according to the results, we recorded the lowest level of interest in the election this decade. Fewer people picked “10” in this poll than in any presidential election year we’ve tested since 2004, with one brief exception early in 2012 that soon ticked back up.As I’ve  documented recently , it’s not surprising that so many voters have indicated disinterest in this election. The electorate desperately wants to change leaders, and yet both political parties offered up more of the same, so there’s logic to the electorate showing less interest in this election than it did in the first Joe Biden-Donald Trump matchup in 2020 or Trump’s race against Hillary Clinton in 2016.Ultimately, barring some event in the fall that resets the electorate’s mindset, it appears we are headed for a lower turnout election. That has its own consequences up and down the ballot, and it makes the third-party candidates — and the various idiosyncrasies of each battleground state — matter more than usual. When variance increases, so do the potential Electoral College outcomes.Bottom line, this poll only reinforces the trends that I’ve been writing about these last few weeks.  This will be a late-deciding electorate , thanks to voters who have decided to tune out an election they believe they already understand without needing any new information. I truly believe that most polling between now and October will tell us very little. We know what 90% of the electorate is going to do — it’s the last 10% of “swing” voters who either swing between the two parties or swing between voting and not voting who will decide this election. And the lack of appeal of the top of the ticket, combined with the feeling among a number of voters that neither party has the answers on the economy or foreign policy, means Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  could become a very powerful “none of the above” factor  in deciding who exhausts their way to victory. Read more from Chuck here →That’s all from The Politics Desk for now.

"Rob Wile,Brian Cheung","Tesla’s stock jumped about 8% in after-hours trading Tuesday after the electric vehicle giant  reported its steepest annual revenue drop in over a decade .Despite softer sales and a growing chorus of skeptics about CEO Elon Musk’s focus on the company, investors cheered its vow to ""accelerate the launch of new models,"" likely including more affordable ones like the long-awaited low-cost Model 2.""They need to adjust to a new environment,""   Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities financial group, said on the heels of the company’s earnings report. Potentially speeding up the Model 2's rollout ""shows they're listening,"" he said.Tesla's  first-quarter revenues slid 9% , its steepest year-over-year decline since 2012. While the financial results were short of Wall Street's expectations, investors are breathing a sigh of relief that the company appears to be prioritizing new vehicles.Tesla has been facing more uncertainty on Wall Street than at any point since its  near-bankruptcy several years ago . Its share price has plunged by nearly two-thirds — from about $407 at its November 2021 peak to about $145 as of Tuesday's market close. The stock has held the title of the S&P 500's worst performer this year.Tesla remains the largest electric vehicle seller in the U.S., where  overall EV sales growth has slowed  after a booming 2023. According to industry website  InsideEVs , 19 Tesla competitors' combined sales growth over the past 12 months climbed 18% in the first quarter — the group's slowest rate in years as they sold just 102,000 all-electric vehicles altogether. Tesla, for its part, delivered 386,810 vehicles alone in that period, down 9% from the same quarter last year and falling well short of analyst expectations.""Pessimism on the entire EV marketplace has reached very high levels,"" Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at the financial services group Fundstrat Global Advisors, LLC, said in an email before Tesla reported its earnings.For the average Tesla investor, the falloff has meant significant financial losses over the past couple of years. The company's declines have been in China, whose most successful EV automaker, BYD — which does not sell in the U.S. — has emerged as a key Tesla rival. Today,  they are neck and neck  for title of world's largest EV maker.""They're going through a brutal demand situation in China, and Musk is now trying to turn this ship around, which went from a Cinderella ride to a Category 5 storm,"" Ives said.Facing greater competition, Tesla has been slashing prices to buoy sales,  announcing  over the weekend that it would discount Models Y, X and S by $2,000 each. It also said this month it would cut 14,000 employees, or 10% of its workforce.In the last quarter, Tesla ramped up sales of the much-anticipated Cybertruck, but it  recalled nearly 4,000 of them last week  over a dangerous accelerator pedal defect.Some Tesla investors attribute the company's troubles not only to broader EV sales trends but also to Musk's split focus across the other companies he oversees, especially the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.""There have been a lot of black-eye moments for Musk and Tesla,"" Ives said.The tech guru's net worth has shrunk by billions, though only enough to push him from No. 1 to No. 3 as the world’s richest person. His role in the company will be more formally examined in June, when Tesla investors will vote on whether to reinstate his  $56 billion pay package  after a Delaware judge struck it down earlier this year.""A lot of shareholders are using it as vote of confidence for the CEO,"" said Fred Lambert, a journalist who covers Tesla at EV website Electrek. But “in the grand scheme of things, Tesla is not in any danger,” he added.Musk has been working to shift the narrative around Tesla. He now says the company is an ""AI/robotics” company, even though cars still drive the bulk of its revenues. He recently posted on X that Tesla was now ""going balls to the wall for autonomy,"" and has placed a new emphasis on rolling out fully automated robotaxis.Lambert said he recently drove a new version of Tesla's automated driving technology, which is officially called Full Self-Driving (Supervised), since it still requires a driver to remain attentive to what the vehicle is doing. He said the new software marks a leap forward and will further benefit from explosive gains in artificial intelligence in the broader tech world.Increasingly, Tesla's investments are going toward autonomous vehicle technology. While it's not yet clear what the current consumer demand is for self-driving cars, Tesla is positioning itself to have an enormous head start, said Tyson Jominy, vice president for data and analytics at J.D. Power.""Given the number of cars they've sold, they've got a potential fleet of sleeper AVs ready to be activated by executive order ... when and if that time comes,"" Jominy said.

"Alex Seitz-Wald,Monica Alba","WASHINGTON — Pro-Palestinian protesters are looking to puncture the festive bubble this weekend surrounding the  White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner  — one of the capital’s biggest parties of the year, with attendees including President Joe Biden, top government officials and leading journalists.Activists are expecting several hundred people at a rally in Kalorama Park, just two blocks from the Washington Hilton, which is hosting the event. The protesters will criticize Biden for his support for Israel in its war in Gaza and the U.S. news media’s coverage of it, according to organizers. The gathering is being branded as an effort to “shut down” the dinner, according to a social media post announcing the demonstration. A group of Palestinian journalists wrote an  open letter  this month calling on their American counterparts to boycott the annual dinner “as an act of solidarity with us — your fellow journalists.” The New York City-based Committee to Protect Journalists says at least  97 journalists  and media workers have been killed in Israel and the Palestinian territories since the war began after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, while the Palestinian Journalist Syndicate places the number higher, at 125. The Palestinian journalist group claims many were  targeted intentionally  by the Israeli military during its operation. Israel has mostly denied intentionally targeting journalists, while saying some of those killed belonged to  militant groups  and were therefore legitimate targets. And it previously said it  could not guarantee  the safety of journalists covering the dangerous conflict.“To sit and schmooze with the president while he sends billions of dollars in weapons to Israel to kill their colleagues in Gaza is unethical and immoral,” said Sandra Tamari, executive director of Adalah Justice Project, the U.S.-based Palestinian advocacy organization that helped organize and release the letter. “To dine with him as he allows Palestinians to die of starvation by cutting off funding to critical humanitarian aid is despicable.”Criticism about the dinner and its surrounding festivities, where reporters and media executives mingle with people they cover, is nothing new. The debate reached a fever pitch during the presidency of Donald Trump, who labeled independent journalists the “enemy of the people,” but was neutralized in part when Trump and officials in his administration  decided not to attend  the event.“This culture of being invited to rub shoulders with the administration is problematic as is, but only more so now,” said  Eman Mohammed , a freelance photojournalist from Gaza who is now based in the U.S. and plans to attend the rally Saturday.  She argued that there is some bias at play when Western journalists champion the causes of American or European reporters kidnapped, arrested, prosecuted or killed abroad while, she said, seemingly looking the other way when nonwhite journalists are harmed. “More than 100-plus journalists have been killed because they are exposing war crimes. And there’s been the bare minimum of speaking up for them from the Western media,” she said. The White House Correspondents’ Association declined to comment. NBC News Senior White House Correspondent Kelly O’Donnell is serving as the group’s 2023-24 president and will preside over the dinner. The concentration of lawmakers, media personalities and the president and his retinue in one place have long made the dinner an attractive target for activists looking to take advantage of a high-profile Washington event.  Last year, climate protesters occupied the sidewalks around the hotel and temporarily  blocked its main driveway , forcing guests to depart their vehicles early and walk past the picketers into the venue. Protests inside the event itself are much less common and perhaps unprecedented, given the tight security, and people involved in organizing the protests said they knew of no plans to try to infiltrate the exclusive invite-only dinner.The Secret Service, which controls security at any event the president attends, is prepared for any possibility, since Biden has consistently drawn protesters at nearly every public event he has held in the past few months, including at a  private fundraiser  in New York City in late March with former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. “We’re kind of used to them,” said a Secret Service official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.The D.C. Metropolitan Police will be responsible for securing crowds outside the venue and at the nearby rally.The president visits the Washington Hilton frequently, and the Secret Service has the security operation there down to a “science,” according to the official. The hotel was the site of the assassination attempt on then-President Ronald Reagan in 1981, an event that led to many changes in presidential security protocols.",2024-04-24 22:16:00 PM EEST,NBC,Protests planned for Washington's premier party weekend,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/pro-palestinian-protests-white-house-correspondents-dinner-rcna149074
Kyla Guilfoil,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a bill Wednesday that would expand abortion access for Arizona residents after the state's Supreme Court upheld a near-total abortion ban this month. The bill would allow Arizona doctors to perform abortion services for Arizona residents in California through the end of the calendar year. ""Arizona's law is the first border state law that will directly impact the state of California,"" Newsom said a news conference Wednesday. ""And rather than just acknowledging that fate and future, we're trying to get ahead of this law."" Newsom said the bill would allow health care providers in good standing in Arizona ""to be able to provide that basic care to patients fleeing the state of Arizona into the state of California."" The proposed legislation would also protect Arizona doctors who come to perform abortion services in California from enforcement in other states. Under the bill, California law enforcement would be prohibited from engaging with other states' law enforcement agencies that seek to prosecute people under abortion bans, state Sen. Nancy Skinner, who authored the bill, said Wednesday. ""Our Arizona sisters can come to California to get the health care that they need, from their own doctors who they rely on, and Arizona doctors can come to California without fear of spending two to five years in prison,"" Skinner said Wednesday. Dr. Tanya W. Spirtos, president of the California Medical Association, stood alongside Newsom and the California Legislative Women's Caucus on Wednesday in support of the proposed legislation. Arizona's ""ruling will put physicians in harm's way for simply providing often lifesaving medical care to their patients,"" Spirtos said. ""It is unfortunate that Arizona women will be forced to travel long distances out of their own state, away from their support network, to seek health care, but I am proud that California is stepping up to offer assistance,"" she added. Newsom spoke a few hours before the Arizona state House voted to  repeal the 1864 law  that makes abortion a felony punishable by two to five years in prison for anyone who performs one or helps a woman obtain one. The bill now goes to the state Senate for consideration. ",2024-04-24 23:19:00 PM EEST,NBC,Gov.

Monica Alba,"WASHINGTON — Second gentleman Doug Emhoff will represent the Biden administration at a memorial Thursday for the seven humanitarian  aid workers with World Central Kitchen  who were killed by  an Israeli airstrike  in Gaza this month.The American charity, run by celebrity chef José Andrés, is set to host an interfaith service at Washington National Cathedral to “honor our heroes,” the group said in a release.Curtis Ried, chief of staff and executive secretary of the White House National Security Council, is also expected to attend.President Joe Biden will be traveling to Syracuse, New York, for an economic event Thursday and cannot attend, though he will send a letter to be read aloud, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said.Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris reached out to Andrés to extend their condolences after the aid workers were killed April 1.One of the seven employees, Jacob Flickinger, was a dual American and Canadian citizen. Others were from Britain, Australia and Poland, along with a Palestinian driver. Biden  said he was “outraged”  by their deaths.The Israel Defense Forces released a preliminary investigation into how the military targeted humanitarian workers, calling it a “grave mistake.” The inquiry found that “the incident should not have occurred” and said those who approved the strike “were convinced that they were targeting armed Hamas operatives and not WCK employees.”The White House has yet to offer an assessment of that report and says it is still reviewing the findings, according to a U.S. official.WCK has called for an independent investigation.Before the strike, WCK was poised to be a key partner in helping provide and distribute aid to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, many of whom face imminent famine, according to experts. Since the aid workers were killed, the humanitarian group has withdrawn all of its operations from Gaza and has not said when it might resume them.The memorial service Thursday will include a performance by the famed cellist Yo-Yo Ma, and several faith leaders will speak.Emhoff partnered with Andrés to host an event at the White House in February focused on eradicating hunger and promoting healthy eating nationwide.",2024-04-24 23:10:00 PM EEST,NBC,Doug Emhoff to attend memorial service for World Central Kitchen workers killed in Israeli strike,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/doug-emhoff-attend-memorial-world-central-kitchen-workers-killed-israe-rcna149237
"Ryan Nobles,Frank Thorp V","WASHINGTON — For Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, the monthslong fight over  U.S. aid to Ukraine  carried historical implications.Last year, Ukrainian forces were successfully  holding off Russian advances  but were in desperate need of new weapons, ammunition and supplies. President Joe Biden sent an urgent request to Congress for a new round of aid to the war-torn country, and McConnell, R-Ky., immediately got on board.But he faced a major obstacle: The loudest voices in his own party had suddenly developed a new opinion about whose side they were on.“It was a family fight from the beginning,” McConnell said Wednesday in an interview. “This was a Republican issue; it was a family fight. And that’s where the action was on Ukraine, on our side.”From McConnell's perspective, winning over the reluctant faction of the GOP is among one of the most significant legislative victories of a congressional career that has spanned decades.“Well, I think certainly one of the most important issues I’ve been involved in over all these years,” McConnell said before pausing. “And if you look at it from a worldwide point of view you could argue that it is the most important.”Throughout his career McConnell shepherded deregulation legislation and Republican tax cuts through the chamber, and last year he became the longest-serving leader of a party in Senate history.McConnell also made one of the most consequential decisions of his career in 2016, when he decided to deny then-President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, a confirmation hearing or a vote. The decision resulted in Donald Trump’s drastically changing the makeup of the court when he won the presidency, by placing three conservative justices on the court who issued the decision to overturn Roe v Wade.About Ukraine, a U.S ally, McConnell firmly believes that the GOP base was swayed by the message of then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who opposed U.S. support for it.“He had an enormous audience among rank-and-file Republicans and began to demonize Ukraine in ways that I felt just completely ignored the facts,” McConnell said. “But he had a big following. And we’re all in politics, I mean, so people begin to hear from their own Republican friends and supporters about this.”McConnell also said Trump contributed to the harsh criticism of Ukraine. The combination of the two most popular voices among GOP voters disparaging Ukraine led congressional Republicans to follow suit, which forced pro-Ukraine Republicans to add a border package to the negotiations, a package they thought had bipartisan support to make it to Biden's desk.They were wrong.“The former president said he would prefer that we not do anything at all,” McConnell recalled about the border provisions. “So that took several months.”McConnell viewed the unfolding debate in the context of the lead-up to World War II. He said it worried him that the same isolationist tendencies that kept America on the sidelines until the attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, were creeping in again at a time he viewed as potentially more dangerous.Asked to compare the threats of 1941 to those of 2024, he said: “We had two big power competitors but not any developed terrorism problems. Now we have two big power competitors, and then we have Iran and terrorism. So this is a tougher situation than we faced then. I don’t want to make the same mistakes that we made then.”The Senate originally considered an aid bill for Ukraine and Israel in February. The vote came on the heels of the failure of a bipartisan push for legislation to address the U.S. border with Mexico, with many Republicans joining Trump in saying they should not pass aid for abroad without addressing domestic threats.But McConnell said that with that debate behind them, he saw support for the Ukraine package grow within his party.“Once it was clear we were not going to get anywhere on the border, that issue fell away, and we were able to focus on what the package basically was,” McConnell said.McConnell, who  announced in February  that he'll step down from the top post at the end of the year while remaining in Congress, concedes that Trump could have stood in the way and made the final steps in this process more difficult but chose not to, which made a big difference.“I thought, at the end, he was helpful,” McConnell said of Trump, who  secured  hi s endorsement  last month.Trump has proven mercurial in his policy positions, moving on issues from day to day, but McConnell hopes for a long-term shift toward supporting Ukraine.“I think that the fact that President Trump embraced [House Speaker Mike Johnson] was helpful. And he’s always impressed by winning, and I think we won by a big margin here in the Senate,” McConnell said of Tuesday's 79-18 vote.",2024-04-25 02:40:00 AM EEST,NBC,Mitch McConnell sees Ukraine aid as one of the most important legislative victories of his career,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/mitch-mcconnell-sees-ukraine-aid-one-important-legislative-victories-c-rcna149240
"Adam Reiss,Jillian Frankel,Gary Grumbach,Dareh Gregorian","The first  criminal trial  of a former president resumes Thursday with a key witness against  Donald Trump  expected to describe details of the hush money agreement that was struck on his behalf with porn star Stormy Daniels. David Pecker , the former publisher of the National Enquirer, is expected to outline his role in Daniels' agreement, as well as another hush money deal involving  Karen McDougal , a former Playboy model who claims she had a monthslong affair with Trump. McDougal alleges the affair began in 2006, the year  Daniels  alleges she had a sexual encounter with him. Trump has denied both women's claims.   Pecker is expected to delve into the tawdry allegations in a New York City courtroom at the same time some of Trump's attorneys will be at the  Supreme Court  in Washington arguing the federal election interference case against him should be dismissed because his actions were protected by presidential immunity.  Pecker, 72, was the first witness called by prosecutors in the Manhattan district attorney's case. In  testimony  Tuesday, he recounted his long friendship with Trump, which he said began in the late 1980s, and a pivotal meeting he had with Trump and his then-lawyer  Michael Cohen  at Trump Tower in 2015 after Trump launched his campaign for president.  Hope Hicks , who would go on to become Trump's White House communications director, was ""in and out"" of the meeting, Pecker said. Pecker said that during the meeting, he agreed to act as Trump's ""eyes and ears"" by watching out for any scandalous stories that could damage his candidacy and that he would help get rid of them. He said the first time the Enquirer did so was when it paid $30,000 to a  doorman  who was selling a story about Trump's fathering an illegitimate child, a tale that turned out to be ""absolutely 1,000% untrue."" The deal in essence prevented the doorman from going public with his claim until after the 2016 election. Pecker said the paper got a tip in June 2016 about McDougal, “a Playboy model who is trying to sell the story about a relationship that she had with Donald Trump for a year.” He said he alerted Cohen to her claims and then got a call from Trump. Trump said Cohen “told me about Karen,” and he asked Pecker, “What do you think?” Pecker said he suggested to Trump that he buy the story, but Trump said, “I don’t buy any stories.” “Any time you do anything like this, it always gets out,” Pecker quoted Trump as saying.Pecker said he told Trump he thought it would be a good idea to ""take this story off the market."" He said Trump responded, ""Let me think about it, and I'll have Michael Cohen call you back in a few days.""Pecker is expected to explain Thursday how the Enquirer subsequently cut a $150,000 deal with McDougal to keep her quiet and his role in Cohen's $130,000 payment to Daniels for a nondisclosure agreement. Prosecutors said the Daniels deal was struck in the weeks before Election Day 2016, when Trump's campaign was reeling from the emergence of the so-called "" Access Hollywood "" tape. The tape included a hot mic moment from 2005 that caught Trump, then the star of ""The Apprentice,"" saying he could kiss and grope women without their consent because ""when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything."" Trump is charged with  34 counts  of falsifying business records relating to money prosecutors say he used to repay Cohen for the hush money payment. He has pleaded  not guilty .

"Lawrence Hurley,Ryan J. Reilly","WASHINGTON — Tackling an unprecedented and politically fraught issue, the Supreme Court on Thursday considers former President  Donald Trump ’s assertion of total immunity from criminal charges over his attempt to overturn the 2020 election results.The court will take on the novel legal question of whether a former president can be prosecuted for what Trump’s attorneys say were “official acts” taken in office, though much of the focus remains on whether the justices will rule quickly so a trial could take place before  the November election .With most legal experts questioning Trump's broad argument that the entire election interference indictment should be dismissed based on immunity, the court's eventual ruling on the extent to which official acts are protected and how quickly it rules will be of equal importance.The case puts considerable scrutiny on the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority that includes three justices Trump appointed. The court already handed Trump an election-year boost when it ruled last month that Colorado  could not kick him off the ballot .The justices have also come under criticism for their delay in taking up Trump's appeal, which some view in itself as a victory for him.The Supreme Court  announced Feb. 28 that it would hear the case , saying it would examine ""whether and if so to what extent does a former president enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office."" The decision  immediately put the prospect of a pre-election trial in jeopardy .A federal appeals court had  ruled Feb. 6  that Trump was not immune from prosecution, writing that ""former President Trump has become citizen Trump, with all of the defenses of any other criminal defendant,"" and that while executive privilege may have protected him during his presidency, it no longer protected him against prosecution.""It would be a striking paradox if the President, who alone is vested with the constitutional duty to 'take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,' were the sole officer capable of defying those laws with impunity,"" the federal appeals court ruled.Under  the original schedule  laid out by U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, Trump's trial had been set to begin March 4, and the jury might have even reached a verdict by this point. Instead, the first of the four criminal cases against Trump to go to trial was the prosecution brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg in New York, where  Trump  was indicted  on 34 counts of falsifying business records tied to a hush money payment in the lead-up to the 2016 election. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.The  federal indictment returned by a grand jury in Washington, D.C.,  in August consisted of four counts: conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights. The Supreme Court has  already heard arguments  in another Jan. 6 case that  could affect two of the charges against Trump  involving obstruction of an official proceeding.Trump, according to the indictment, conspired to ""overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 presidential election by using knowingly false claims of election fraud to obstruct the government function by which those results are collected, counted and certified.”The indictment focuses on Trump’s involvement in  a scheme to submit fake election certificates  to Congress in the hope that they would nullify President Joe Biden’s victory. The chain of events culminated in the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.Federal prosecutors led by special counsel Jack Smith say Trump's actions constituted a series of crimes. Trump says he was merely expressing his concerns, which were not based on any evidence, that the election was plagued with fraud. He has pleaded not guilty to the federal charges.While numerous Jan. 6 defendants have acknowledged that they were  duped and manipulated or that they lacked the critical thinking skills to recognize the lies about the 2020 election for what they were , Trump and his lawyers have insisted that he sincerely believed the election was stolen.Smith, meanwhile, has argued in court papers that Trump has no immunity and that the case should go to trial immediately — whether or not his conduct at the time involved official acts.Trump's lawyers cite, among other things, a 1982 Supreme Court ruling that said presidents are immune from civil suits when the alleged conduct falls within the ""outer perimeter"" of their official duties. That case has never been applied in the criminal context.A key issue, as yet unresolved, is whether any of Trump's actions mentioned in the indictment were official acts. Even if some conduct is off-limits, it would not necessarily mean that any charges are dismissed.Smith's team previously  estimated  it would need ""no longer than four to six weeks"" to present its case to a jury;  potential jurors  were told the trial ""may last approximately three months after jury selection is completed."" At the time the case was put on hold in December, when the federal appeals court agreed to take it up, 88 days were left in the trial preparation schedule.That timeline — nearly three more months of trial prep before jury selection begins — makes a verdict before Election Day unlikely, although Chutkan has indicated that the case would proceed like any other criminal prosecution and that Trump's campaign schedule would not have an impact on the court.The Supreme Court has various options in deciding the case, with both sides accepting that the ruling might not completely resolve the immunity issue. One scenario is that the justices could reject Trump's broadest arguments while remanding the case back to Chutkan to resolve whether any of the conduct in question involved official acts.

Associated Press,"SYDNEY — The world’s top anti-doping regulator says 23 Chinese swimmers were cleared to compete at the Tokyo Olympics despite testing positive for a banned heart medication because it agreed with Chinese authorities and ruled that their samples had been contaminated.The World Anti-Doping Agency said Saturday that the swimmers tested positive for the heart medication trimetazidine in the months leading up to the start of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 but that Chinese authorities told the agency the positives were the result of contamination.“Ultimately, we concluded that there was no concrete basis to challenge the asserted contamination,” WADA’s senior director of science and medicine Olivier Rabin said in a news release.The 30-member Chinese swim team won six medals in Tokyo, including three golds. Many of the athletes still compete for China and are expected to swim at the Paris Olympics this summer.Reports about the doping positives came out Saturday in the Daily Telegraph in Sydney and The New York Times.WADA responded to what it called “some misleading and potentially defamatory media coverage this week” and explained the process it undertook upon learning about the positive tests.The global drug-fighting organization said it also had been given a tip by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency as early as 2020 — before this case arose — about allegations of doping cover-ups in China but that USADA never followed up with evidence.USADA CEO Travis Tygart called the news of the Chinese positive tests “crushing.”“It’s even more devastating to learn the World Anti-Doping Agency and the Chinese Anti-Doping Agency secretly, until now, swept these positives under the carpet by failing to fairly and evenly follow the global rules that apply to everyone else in the world,” Tygart said.World Aquatics, which oversees global swimming, told the Daily Telegraph it was confident “that these (adverse analytical findings) were handled diligently and professionally, and in accordance with all applicable anti-doping regulations, including the World Anti-Doping Code.”The drug at the center of this case was also the medication that led to the suspension of  Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva  at the Winter Olympics in Beijing in 2022.In that case, WADA moved quickly to sanction Valieva upon learning about her positive test.The case underscores what many view as a flaw in the global anti-doping system — that a country’s own anti-doping organization is often the first line of defense in catching drug cheats and those organizations have different levels of motivation to fulfill that role.",2024-04-21 10:57:00 AM EEST,NBC,Chinese swimmers won Olympic medals despite failed doping tests,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/chinese-swimmers-olympics-failed-doping-tests-rcna148701

Reuters,"Hawaiian surfer Gabriela Bryan shared a wave with a pod of dolphins as she won her first world championship tour event over Californian rookie Sawyer Lindblad in pumping surf at the Western Australia Margaret River Pro on Sunday.Margaret River local Jack Robinson took out a spectacular men’s final against Hawaii’s two-time world champion John John Florence in a replay of their 2022 final of the same event.Robinson and Florence were the two form surfers of the event and traded huge carves on the double-overhead walls as the waves finally improved on last day of the 11-day competition window.The decisive moment came midway through the final when Robinson scored an excellent 9.10 out of 10 for two giant turns on the biggest wave of the day and followed it up with a lofty frontside air on the very next wave for an 8.17.Florence kept battling and scored an excellent wave of his own but could not reel in the Western Australian, who finished with 17.27 out of 20 to Florence’s 16.04.“That was the final I wanted, I wanted to throw everything at it. It’s always fun surfing against John — we’re going to have many more heats together,” said Robinson, who missed the event last year due to injury.The world tour next heads to the thumping tubes of Teahupo’o in Tahiti, where both Robinson and Florence will be among the favourites battling for Olympic gold in just a few months time.Florence earlier scored the only perfect 10 of the event in his semi-final against Australian wildcard George Pittar, blowing his tail out and holding onto his board with the toenails of one foot before recovering for a couple more turns.Both Bryan, 22, and 18-year-old Lindblad had to go deep at Margaret River to avoid the mid-season cut and secure their place for the remainder of the 2024 tour.Lindblad went into the final in top form, having dispatched two-time world champion Tyler Wright in their semi-final to secure her place above the cut line.Bryan took a commanding lead with a 7.83 for two powerful turns on her forehand as a handful of dolphins swooped around her.“When I kicked out, I was just wow! That wave was sent to me by someone, the dolphins in it. It was magical,” said Bryan, who scored an even better 8.10 on her second scoring ride.“I’m just so happy we got good waves today and all the girls put on a really good show. It’s insane, I just won!”Both the men’s and women’s field will now be cut for the final four events of the world tour, with 11-time world champion  Kelly Slater  and Australian veteran Sally Fitzgibbons among those missing out.",2024-04-22 11:38:00 AM EEST,NBC,U.S. surfer accompanied by dolphins as she wins world championship event in Australia,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/us-surfer-accompanied-dolphins-wins-world-championship-event-australia-rcna148750
The Associated Press,"DENVER — LeBron James was seeing red after  the Los Angeles Lakers watched  a golden opportunity slip away.His frustration wasn’t so much centered on blowing a 20-point lead. Or his late missed 3-pointer that rimmed out with the game tied. Or Jamal Murray’s fadeaway buzzer-beater that gave the Denver Nuggets a 101-99 win over the Lakers in Game 2 of their first-round series Monday night.James’ anger was more distant — the NBA’s  replay center  in Secaucus, New Jersey. At the heart of his wrath was a second-half foul of Michael Porter Jr. that was overturned with the league saying MPJ had made only marginal contact on D’Angelo Russell.“I don’t understand what’s going on in the replay center, to be honest,” said James, whose team heads back to Los Angeles for Game 3 on Thursday facing a 2-0 deficit. “D-Lo clearly gets hit in the face on the drive. What the (expletive) do we have a replay center ... it doesn’t make sense. It makes no sense. It bothers me.”James wasn’t his usually expansive self in his postgame interview after the Lakers watched Murray and the Nuggets storm back from a 68-48 hole to capture their 10th straight win over the Lakers.James had a chance to give the Lakers a lead with around 16 seconds left on a wide open 3-pointer.“Rimmed out,” lamented James, who finished with 26 points and 12 assists.Porter grabbed the rebound, setting up Murray’s game-winner, a fadeaway jumper over Anthony Davis as time expired.James got right to the point after the game.— On Denver’s comeback, which included being outscored 32-20 in the fourth: “We missed shots. We still got great looks and we just missed them. And they made it.”— On Russell hitting seven 3s after going 1 for 9 from deep in the series opener: “We never lost confidence in him. D-Lo is D-Lo.”— On if the Lakers can take anything from this game into Game 3 in L.A.: “Every game is its own challenge.”— On the challenges after a heartbreaking loss: “Of course it’s a heartbreaking game and you don’t want to lose in that fashion.”That’s when James began voicing his frustration with the replay center. Earlier in the game, Murray was called for a foul when James drove to the basket, only to have the Nuggets successfully challenge for the foul to be waved off.In his replay-center rant, James referenced Monday’s earlier game, when the New York Knicks rallied in the final 30 seconds f  or a wild 104-101 victory  over the Philadelphia 76ers. The Knicks got the go-ahead 3-pointer from Donte DiVincenzo with 13 seconds left, a possession that started when they stole the ball from Tyrese Maxey. Joel Embiid said Maxey was fouled, and also that coach Nick Nurse and some players had attempted to call timeout before the Knicks got the ball.“What are we doing?” James said as he ended his postgame interview.",2024-04-23 10:51:00 AM EEST,NBC,"LeBron James rants at NBA's replay center for calls, Lakers lose on buzzer-beater, trail Denver 2-0",https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/lebron-james-rants-nbas-replay-center-calls-lakers-lose-buzzer-beater-rcna148911

The Associated Press,"Roman Gabriel had big size and a big arm when he was the No. 2 draft pick of the Los Angeles Rams in 1962. Even while playing in an era of grinding it out on the ground, he still holds the  Rams’ team record with 154 touchdown passes .Gabriel, the first Filipino American quarterback in the NFL and the league MVP in 1969, died Saturday. He was 83.His son Roman Gabriel III  announced his father’s death  on social media, saying he died peacefully at home of natural causes.In 2021, the elder Gabriel told the Los Angeles Times, “I am retired with heart problems and arthritis but happy.” He said he split time between Wilmington, North Carolina, and Little River, South Carolina.“We mourn the loss of Rams legend and football pioneer, Roman Gabriel,”  the Rams said on X , formerly known as Twitter.Gabriel, who played at North Carolina State and was a two-time player of the year in the Atlantic Coast Conference, was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1989.He was 6-foot-5 and 235 pounds, big for a quarterback in that era. Green Bay coach Vince Lombardi once described him as “a big telephone pole,” according to the Los Angeles Times.Gabriel played 11 years for the Rams and five years with the Philadelphia Eagles, where he was traded after the Rams acquired John Hadl.“Gabe was an amazing player and an even better mentor. Words can’t explain my thanks for what a great teammate he was,” retired quarterback  Ron Jaworski , whom Gabriel backed up on the Eagles in his final season, posted on X. “A special player and a better man!”Gabriel was such a hot prospect that the Rams made him the No. 2 pick in the NFL draft, and the Oakland Raiders of the rival AFL selected him No. 1. Gabriel wound up signing with the Rams, though it took until George Allen was hired as coach in 1966 for Gabriel to start leaving a mark.From 1967 to 1970, Gabriel led the Rams to a 41-14-4 record and two division titles, though never a playoff game. He was voted MVP in 1969 after throwing for 2,549 yards with 24 touchdown passes and five rushing scores.Allen left for Washington after the 1970, and Gabriel was shipped to the Eagles in 1973. He was the NFL comeback player of the year, leading the league with 23 touchdown passes and 3,219 yards, as he tried to help revive the Eagles’ offense.After retiring, Gabriel worked briefly for CBS, calling NFL games.He went into coaching, with stints at Cal Poly Pomona, the Boston Breakers of the USFL and Raleigh-Durham in the World League of American Football.Gabriel also dabbled in acting. His movie credits included “Skidoo” starring Jackie Gleason in 1968, and 1969’s “The Undefeated” starring John Wayne and Rock Hudson. He appeared in such TV shows as “Gilligan’s Island,” “Perry Mason,” “Ironside” and “Wonder Woman.” He also joined Bob Hope on a USO tour of Vietnam.",2024-04-22 00:12:00 AM EEST,NBC,Roman Gabriel dies at 83.

Matt Lavietes,"A group of more than 400 current and former Olympic, professional and collegiate athletes, over 300 academics and roughly 100 advocacy groups released separate letters Tuesday urging the NCAA not to ban transgender women from competing in women’s college sports.The letters were coordinated by LGBTQ sports advocacy group Athlete Ally, and the signatories include former U.S. Women’s National Team soccer co-captain Megan Rapinoe, former WNBA and Olympic basketball star Sue Bird, and former NFL defensive end R.K. Russell. “We call on you to be on the right side of history and affirm that sport is truly for us all,” the  letter signed by the athletes  reads. “Do not ban transgender women from NCAA women’s sports.”In a separate statement from Rapinoe, arguably the most famous athlete to sign, the two-time Olympic medalist said “bans against trans athletes framed as ‘protecting women’s sports’ do not speak for us, and do nothing to protect us.”“The time is now for the NCAA and the nationwide athletic community to speak up and affirm that sports should be for everyone, including transgender athletes,” Rapinoe said in the statement, which was released by Athlete Ally. When asked about the letters, the NCAA said in a statement that “college sports are the premier stage for women’s sports in America and the NCAA will continue to promote Title IX, make unprecedented investments in women’s sports and ensure fair competition for all student-athletes in all NCAA championships.”The NCAA has permitted transgender women to compete on women’s sports teams under certain conditions  since 2010 . In 2022, the association announced that it would  implement a new sport-by-sport approach . The current guidelines, like the 2010 guidelines, require transgender women to undergo at least one year of testosterone suppression, but the new rules largely defer the specifics to the national governing body for each sport.The new rules set a  media firestorm that first brewed  over University of Pennsylvania transgender swimmer  Lia Thomas’  winning streak in the 2021-2022 season. Tuesday’s letters are part of a broader —  and highly divisive  — debate over transgender sports participation. A recent  report  from Gallup found that 69% of people say that transgender athletes should only be allowed to compete on sports teams that correspond with the sex they were assigned at birth.The NCAA, the largest college sports association with  nearly 1,100 member schools , has been a central figure in this debate.Last month, more than a dozen college swimmers and volleyball players  sued the NCAA , arguing that the sporting body violated their Title IX rights by allowing Thomas to compete at the national women’s swimming championships in 2022. Former University of Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines, who was one of the plaintiffs in last month’s lawsuit and was mentioned in two of the letters to the NCAA, tied with Thomas for fifth place in the women’s 200-yard freestyle race at a 2022 NCAA championship meet and has since become a vocal advocate against trans inclusion in women’s sports. When asked about the letters on Tuesday, Gaines denounced the NCAA's policies on trans athletes' participation, calling them ""discriminatory.""""Allowing even a single male athlete to compete in women’s sports takes numerous opportunities away from females,"" Gaines said in an email. ""The female athletes governed by NCAA policies do not accept this."" Just last week, 17 House Republicans co-signed a  letter  to NCAA President Charlie Baker urging him to prohibit trans women from competing in all women’s sports. The letter cited Thomas’ wins and a decision earlier this month by a smaller sports governing body, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, or NAIA,  to prohibit trans women from participating in women’s sports  at its approximately  250 member colleges . “We urge the NCAA to reconsider its current policy that allows biological males to deprive women of a fair opportunity to compete and achieve athletic success,” the letter reads. “All women in NCAA-affiliated schools should not fear having their athletic accomplishments minimized by biological males.”Conservative lawmakers across the country have also gotten involved with the issue. Two dozen states across the country now have bans on transgender students participating in school sports that align with their gender identity, according to LGBTQ think tank  Movement Advancement Project . Injunctions are temporarily blocking some of these laws, including those in Arizona, Idaho and Utah, according to MAP.The Biden administration on Friday  issued a revised Title IX regulation , clarifying that the 1972 federal civil rights law prohibits anti-LGBTQ discrimination in schools. However, the new rule notably excluded a new policy forbidding schools from enacting blanket bans on transgender athletes, which, according to The Associated Press, the administration had initially planned to include.

"Keir Simmons,Alex Holmes","PARIS — Meandering down   the  Seine  R iver , the light breeze, gentle current and the sun’s glistening rays weren’t the only things the three kayakers were hoping to catch on a warm spring day — they were also on the hunt for garbage. By attaching nylon stockings to the side of their kayaks, they scooped up even the smallest fragments of plastic, as well as the everyday detritus of life in the French capital that washes to the river’s surface every time it rains. The members of the Arc de Seine Kayak club then sent what they had collected to be tested for bacterial levels. “My kayak capsized this morning and I’m OK,” a laughing Paul Maakad told NBC News on Sunday, at the Pont de Sevres in central Paris. But while Maakad, 40, and his fellow boaters said they were not scared of getting into the river, with less than 100 days to go before the 2024  Paris Olympics , fears are growing that events like the marathon swim, the triathlon and the paratriathlon could be postponed or canceled because of high pollution levels, or that the flotilla-based opening ceremony could be affected.Earlier this month, Tony Estanguet, the president of the Paris Organizing Committee, expressed confidence ""that it will be possible to use the Seine,” but admitted that the swimming leg of the triathlon could be canceled if pollution levels are too high.  ""It’s what we want to avoid, of course,” he said . His comments came days after  a French charity warned  that bacteria, including “pollution of fecal origin,” was far higher in the river than permitted. As part of an ambitious plan to open up the Seine to public swimmers by 2025 — after being illegal for 100 years because of dangerously high pollution levels — France has spent 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) on altering and upgrading the city’s antiquated sewage system, which now includes a 13-million-gallon overflow tank called the Austerlitz Basin. But in August, the swim portion of the test marathon event was canceled because the river failed pollution tests.As the starting gun to the Games approaches, Fluidion, one of the companies the city of Paris contracted to monitor bacteria in the water,   exclusively shared its findings with NBC News. A sample of water collected by the Pont Alexander III bridge, in the city’s center, showed E. coli levels two-and-a-half times the level considered safe for swimming. But that in itself isn’t necessarily a concern for the Games themselves, according to  Dan Angelescu , the CEO of Fluidion, a tech company that develops water testing products. “In the summer when there is a lot of sunlight, when the water flow, river flow rate is really low, and when there is no rain for several weeks, let’s say two or three weeks without rain, you can actually reach really good water quality conditions,” he said in an interview this month.But he added that even a small rain event could make  E. coli  levels shoot up. “You may swim in very polluted water and nothing may happen to you, or you may swim and you may develop itches, or you may develop infections, or you may catch a strain of E. coli that may be pathogenic,"" he said. ""Those aren’t very common, but they exist, and that could get you really sick.” But he cautioned that exposure to other pathogens associated with the presence of E. coli could lead to contracting a norovirus, diarrhea “or you could get certain diseases that can really kill you.”In a bid to boost public confidence, French President  Emmanuel Macron  and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo have both promised to swim in the river to prove its cleanliness.Pierre-Antoine Molina, a director of public policy in Paris, said he would follow suit. In an interview Monday, he said that water pollution in the river “has been gradually improving.”   He added that the work to upgrade the city's sewage system had led to the modernization of wastewater treatment plants and an improvement in the network that separates wastewater and rainwater. “It’s an ancient city going back to Roman times, so inevitably that’s a big task,” he said, adding that a lot of buildings had been gone up after  World War II  “and the sewage system did not always cope.” Around 30 miles downstream   from Paris, Edouard Combette, 50, showed no fear as he plunged headfirst into the storied waterway, which has inspired artists like the impressionist painter Claude Monet.   “Life is good here,” he said after coming up for air, adding that he didn’t know whether the water was completely safe.  “Don’t drink the water. You can swim, but don’t drink,” he said. “I haven’t heard of anyone dying or getting sick.”",2024-04-21 11:59:00 AM EEST,NBC,Inside the Olympic effort to clean up the River Seine — and why it may be spoiled by a rainy day,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/olympic-effort-clean-river-seine-may-spoiled-rainy-day-rcna147966
Greg Rosenstein,"The first round of the 2024 NFL Draft takes place Thursday at 8 p.m. in Detroit, a night that could alter the future of many franchises. The Chicago Bears, Washington Commanders and New England Patriots own the top three selections, and many speculate those picks going to quarterbacks, which has happened three other times, most recently in 2021. USC signal-caller Caleb Williams is all but certain to go No. 1, so the intrigue officially starts with Washington. Which quarterback will the new general manager, Adam Peters, take? That’s just one of the many storylines to watch on ABC, ESPN or the NFL Network.Is Williams guaranteed to go to Chicago?Nothing is guaranteed until NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell steps up to the podium and reads his name but, essentially, yes. Williams, the consensus top prospect, threw for 3,633 yards, 30 touchdowns and five interceptions last season. He won the Heisman Trophy as the best player in college football the prior year after taking the Trojans from four wins to an 11-win team. Williams threw for 4,075 yards, 37 touchdowns and only four interceptions over 13 games in 2022.He will join a retooled Chicago team that traded for six-time Pro Bowl receiver Keenan Allen and signed running back D’Andre Swift in free agency this offseason. Williams will also be able to throw the ball to rising stars in receiver D.J. Moore and tight end Cole Kmet.What will the Commanders do at No. 2?Like the Bears, the Commanders have been desperate for a franchise quarterback for more than three decades. There was a glimmer of hope with Robert Griffin III, the 2012 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year, but multiple injuries over the next seven seasons led to an early exit from the league. Will this  finally  be Washington’s chance to turn around the franchise?The Commanders have a new owner in Josh Harris and a new general manager in Peters, and both have been tight-lipped on whom they might select. But all signs point to either LSU quarterback Jayden Daniels or University of North Carolina quarterback Drake Maye.The 6-foot-4, 210-pound Daniels won the 2023 Heisman Trophy after one of the most electrifying seasons in college football history. He threw for 3,812 yards, 40 touchdowns and only four interceptions, while also adding 1,134 yards and 10 touchdowns on the ground. Maye, at 6-foot-4 and 230 pounds, boasts the prototypical size for the position and has drawn comparisons to Los Angeles Chargers signal-caller Justin Herbert. After being named 2022 ACC Player and Rookie of the Year as a sophomore, he threw for 3,608 yards, 24 touchdowns and nine interceptions as a junior.University of Michigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy, who led the  Wolverines to their first national title  since 1997, is also reportedly being considered.Patriots could look to trade downNew England is still looking to find a replacement for legendary quarterback Tom Brady, who left the franchise in 2019. Mac Jones, a first-round pick in 2021, looked promising as a rookie but saw production drop off over the last two seasons. He was dealt to the Jacksonville Jaguars this offseason. The Patriots signed Jacoby Brissett, though he’s not expected to be the long-term starter. Will they instead take whoever is left among  Daniels, Maye and McCarthy? If not, a trade down with a team such as the New York Giants, Minnesota Vikings or Las Vegas Raiders could be in play. All are searching for a quarterback and would give up a multitude of picks to secure that. The Patriots, who finished 4-13 last season and has holes all over the roster, could use those extra picks to expedite a rebuild. Which wide receiver will go first? For much of the past year, Ohio State receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. has been the presumptive top wideout available. It’s still likely he is the first pass-catcher off the board, but LSU’s Malik Nabers and the University of Washington’s Rome Odunze have reportedly seen their stock rise enough this offseason to make it a competition. Harrison, the son of longtime Indianapolis Colts star receiver Marvin Harrison, is arguably the greatest receiver in Ohio State history. He won the Biletnikoff Award last season as the most outstanding receiver in college football after catching 67 passes for 1,211 yards and 14 touchdowns. Nabers will look to become the next star receiver from LSU, joining the likes of Justin Jefferson, Ja’Marr Chase and Odell Beckham Jr. The 6-foot, 199-pound Nabers catches everything in sight and will provide a team with instant playmaking ability. He hauled in 89 passes for 1,569 yards and 14 scores.Odunze, at 6-foot-3, 215 pounds, possesses elite size for the position. He set a program record with 1,640 receiving yards last season, the highest total in the country and the third-most ever in the Pac-12.Defensive players expected to waitGenerally speaking, this draft is known for elite offensive prospects. We could see five quarterbacks, six receivers and potentially double-digit offensive linemen picked in the first 32 selections. But let’s not forget about a few defensive studs. Pass rushers Dallas Turner (University of Alabama) and Jared Verse (Florida State) as well as defensive tackle Byron Murphy III (University of Texas) will all be in the mix to come off the board early. Sad night for Panthers fansThe Carolina Panthers finished last season with a league-worst 2-15 record. Top pick and quarterback Bryce Young struggled mightily as a rookie (though he didn’t have much to work with) and the team has many areas of concern. They should have the No. 1 pick in the draft for a chance to turn around the franchise, but alas … they have zero first-round selections. Carolina surrendered Moore, 2023 first- and second-round picks, a 2024 first-round pick and a 2025 second-round pick for the chance to take Young last year. If he doesn’t improve quickly, and that’s a big if, it will go down as one of the worst trades in NFL history. Panthers fans can probably just take Thursday night off.",2024-04-24 14:00:00 PM EEST,NBC,"2024 NFL Draft: Top prospects, storylines to watch ahead of Thursday's first round",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/nfl-draft-2024-prospects-picks-teams-date-time-when-rcna148793
The Associated Press,"MILWAUKEE — Indiana Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton said a fan directed a racial slur at his younger brother during Game 1 of an Eastern Conference first-round playoff series with the Milwaukee Bucks.“My little brother in the stands the other day was called an N-word,” Haliburton said after the Pacers’  125-108 Game 2 victory  over the Bucks on Tuesday night. “It was important for us as a family to just address that. That was important for us to talk about because that didn’t sit right with anybody in our family. It’s just been important to have my family here right now, and my little brother’s handled that the right way.”The Bucks were asked about Haliburton’s comments after Tuesday’s game.“An arena guest services representative reported that during Sunday’s game a few guests were not sitting in their correct seats,” a Bucks spokesman responded. “The guest services representative asked the group to move one section over to their correct seats. Then, one of the individuals in the group claimed to the representative that a person sitting in front of him had used a derogatory term toward him. The accused person denied the accusation. The group moved to their correct seats and no further incident was reported.“We take our fan environment extremely seriously and are committed to providing a safe and secure experience.”Haliburton was making his playoff debut in his home state.

The Associated Press,"Golden State guard Stephen Curry knew he was running out of chances to play in what would be  his first Olympics , so he and his wife Ayesha started planning many months ago about how to make the Paris Games work for their family.Their growing family, that is.Ayesha Curry revealed in March that she is pregnant with the couple’s fourth child and the baby is due in June. That’s not entirely by accident; the couple thought ahead with hopes of keeping the Olympic months of July and August clear — just in case.“We thought about it ahead of time, which was nice,” Curry said. “If the timing didn’t work at a certain month in the fall, we actually would have made a different decision knowing the Olympics were on the radar. So, thankfully, the Lord looked out for us and if everything goes to plan, I’ll be available this summer.”That is, indeed, the plan. Curry was one of the 12 names formally announced by USA Basketball on Wednesday as the initial roster for this year’s Paris Olympics. It’s entirely possible that the roster gets tweaked between now and the first practice in early July — injuries or long playoff runs could spark changes — but Curry has been planning to make his Olympic debut this summer for some time.“I wanted to play in the last two that I was eligible for,” Curry said, referring to the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games and the Tokyo Games that were delayed to 2021 because of the pandemic. “Watching guys that I’ve been competing against the last 10 years all have that experience win gold medals, watching three of my teammates (Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green) win gold medals, I knew I wanted to do that.”It would be logical to think that part of the recruitment pitch to Curry this time around was the fact that the Olympic team is coached by Steve Kerr, his coach with the Warriors.That wasn’t really the case. Curry had talks with Durant and LeBron James about teaming up — those talks sparked in part by the U.S. taking a less star-studded team to the World Cup at Manila last summer and finishing fourth — but Kerr wasn’t pushing his best player to play this year.“He wanted to do it,” Kerr said. “He’s excited. I think 2016 would have been the year that made the most sense. In 2020, there was the pandemic. But I’ve never had the discussion with him. Going to the Finals wears you down and we had gone in 2015 and 2016. Then 2021 comes around, there was the pandemic, but now, it makes perfect sense. It’s another box to check in his career.”There aren’t too many of those boxes unchecked. And this might really be the last one of any significance left.He’s the NBA’s all-time 3-point recordholder, a four-time NBA champion, 10-time All-Star, nine-time (and probably soon to be 10-time) All-NBA selection, a two-time scoring champion, a two-time MVP, a Finals MVP, an All-Star MVP and a member of the league’s 75th anniversary team. He even helped put together one of the more memorable moments in All-Star history this year,  when he faced off with WNBA star Sabrina Ionescu  — someone he simultaneously mentors and admires — in a 3-point contest.The legacy has long been secure. But a little extra gold wouldn’t hurt.“That’s the goal,” Curry said.Curry and the Warriors won 46 games this season but didn’t make the NBA playoffs, falling to Sacramento on Tuesday in an elimination game of the  Western Conference play-in tournament, 118-94.  So, the next time he’s slated to play for real is now July, when the Americans convene for training camp in Las Vegas. The U.S. opens Olympic play against Serbia on July 28.Curry has played with “USA” across his chest plenty of times before, going back 17 years. He was on the under-19 team that won gold at the 2007 Global Games and won silver in that year’s U19 world championships — “that burned,” Curry said, “because you hate losing at anything.”He hasn’t lost a game with the national team since — 18 games, 18 wins. The Americans went 9-0 on their way to gold at the 2010 world championship (now called the World Cup), then went 9-0 on the way to another gold at the World Cup in 2014.“I definitely wanted this experience,” Curry said of playing in an Olympics. “I think the timing is just right. I’m later in my career. This is probably the last opportunity I have to play. And that made it a much easier decision to say, ‘This makes sense.’ And then I was talking to some other guys who were interested in playing, so you knew this could be a great team.”",2024-04-18 05:13:00 AM EEST,NBC,Stephen Curry and wife Ayesha planned new baby around Paris Olympics,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/stephen-curry-wife-ayesha-baby-paris-olympics-rcna148314
Denise Chow,"Federal officials on Monday unveiled a set of tools aimed at helping protect people in the United States from the  dangers of extreme heat .The resources, developed jointly by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, include new color-coded heat forecasts and a public dashboard showing local heat risks and air quality levels.  New guidelines were also released for clinicians , instructing them on how to educate patients about coping with heat waves and the health impacts of extreme heat.The tools are part of a broader government initiative to better prepare the country for heat waves, which are increasing in frequency, intensity and duration as a result of climate change. Officials said these efforts are geared at raising awareness among those who are particularly vulnerable to extreme heat, including seniors, pregnant women, people with asthma, young children and individuals with certain underlying health conditions.Among the new tools is an experimental system from NOAA called “ HeatRisk ,” which provides a seven-day heat forecast for locations across the contiguous U.S. A numerical and color-coded scale shows users the potential dangers of heat and humidity in their area. That resource is designed to be used in conjunction with a new dashboard from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which allows people to enter their zip code to see real-time and forecasted heat risks and air quality information. Together, the tools and guidelines can, for instance, help people identify a location to stay cool if they don’t have working air conditioning, recognize symptoms of heat-related illness or understand how their medications may interact with heat, CDC director Mandy Cohen said Monday in a news briefing.“Heat can impact our health, but heat-related illness and death are preventable,” Cohen said.Heat kills more people in the U.S. each year  than any other extreme weather event, including floods, hurricanes and tornadoes. Last year was the  planet’s warmest on record , and the summer was brutally hot for huge swaths of the U.S., particularly across the South and Southwest. NOAA officials said they hope the new resources will help communities plan for the upcoming summer months. The agency has said it expects temperatures for much of the U.S. in May and June to be above average, ahead of what is expected to be another hot summer across the country.“When it comes to heat, it’s never too early to prepare,” NOAA administrator Rick Spinrad said in the briefing.On NOAA's HeatRisk tool, the scale ranges from 0 or green, meaning little or no risk from expected heat, to 4 or magenta, which indicates extreme and/or long-duration heat-related impacts.The risk levels account for the projected high and low temperatures, and factor in the cumulative impacts of heat over daytime and nighttime conditions, according to NOAA. The outlooks are designed to be personalized by location, since a 100-degree Fahrenheit day in Miami will feel different from a 100-degree day in Phoenix, for example.The forecasts also include historical context to help people understand how unusual the projected temperatures will be for any given time of year. Ken Graham, director of NOAA’s National Weather Service, said the tools could help users plan when to limit time outdoors or put off certain strenuous activities. The idea is to give people more context to supplement the heat watches and warnings that the agency issues, he added.NOAA said the National Weather Service initially developed a prototype of the HeatRisk tool for California in 2013. In 2017, the project was expanded to include all Western states, and it is now available experimentally across the contiguous U.S. Members of the public can  submit feedback  on the tool to the National Weather Service through Sept. 30.",2024-04-22 23:09:00 PM EEST,NBC,New tools from NOAA and CDC show people their risk from heat as another hot summer looms,https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/heat-forecast-tools-noaa-cdc-show-risk-rcna147909
Greg Rosenstein,"The Detroit Lions are officially solidifying their future. The team and star wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown agreed to a four-year contract extension worth more than $120 million, with $77 million of that guaranteed,  according to NFL Network . St. Brown, 24, was entering the final year of his rookie contract. The Lions also signed All-Pro offensive tackle Penei Sewell to a four-year, $112 million extension, according to the NFL Network. The new deal makes Sewell the highest-paid offensive lineman in the league. St. Brown caught 119 passes (second in the NFL) for 1,515 yards (third) and 10 touchdowns (tied for fourth) last season, earning All-Pro honors. Sewell was Pro Football Focus’ top-rated offensive tackle for the second straight season after he allowed just one sack and committed seven total penalties all year. St. Brown and Sewell — along with quarterback Jared Goff and head coach Dan Campbell — were instrumental in Detroit’s recent turnaround. After a 3-13-1 record in 2021, the Lions won nine and 12 games, respectively, over the last two seasons. Detroit won its first playoff game in 32 years last season, defeating former quarterback Matthew Stafford and the Los Angeles Rams, and advanced to the NFC Championship Game before it fell to the San Francisco 49ers. The Lions hold the 29th overall pick in  Thursday’s NFL  d raft .

David K. Li,"Onetime  University of Southern California football  great  Reggie Bush  will again be known as a Heisman Trophy winner,  regaining the college game's top hono r  after an  improper benefits scandal  tarnished his storied amateur career, officials said Wednesday.The Trojans running back was named college football's best player in 2005, convincingly winning the vote over star quarterbacks of the time such as Texas' Vince Young, Bush's teammate Matt Leinart, Notre Dame's Brady Quinn and Penn State's Michael Robinson.But five years later,  that honor was taken  away from Bush in the wake of allegations that his family received benefits from an agent while he was still a student-athlete at USC.USC had surrendered the replica of the trophy it had displayed on campus, and Bush was no longer invited to Heisman Trophy ceremonies.“I am grateful to once again be recognized as the recipient of the Heisman Trophy,” Bush said in a statement Wednesday. “This reinstatement is not only a personal victory but also a validation of the tireless efforts of my supporters and advocates who have stood by me throughout this arduous journey.”Bush  posted  a pho t o of himself on  Instagram  of himself standing with the trophy Wednesday and a caption reading, ""No one can take from you what God has for you.""Heisman officials said  it was difficult to maintain sanctions against Bush when modern college athletes are profiting from  their name s  and likeness es . And just last month , former Texas A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel, the 2012 winner,  said he wouldn't attend  any Heisman ceremonies if Bush remained banned.The annual award is given out in December in New York City. The 2023 honor went to  LSU quarterback Jayden Daniels .“We are thrilled to welcome Reggie Bush back to the Heisman family in recognition of his collegiate accomplishments,” Heisman Trophy Trust President Michael Comerford said in a statement.“We considered the enormous changes in college athletics over the last several years in deciding that now is the right time to reinstate the Trophy for Reggie. We are so happy to welcome him back.” Bush's name was listed on the Heisman Trophy's website Wednesday  as  the  winner of the 2005  honor .  As recently as April 11, the site  listed no winner for 2005 .Bush still insists he did nothing wrong.“I want to make it abundantly clear that I have always acted with integrity and in accordance with the rules and regulations set forth by the NCAA,” he said. “The allegations brought against me were unfounded and unsupported by evidence, and I am grateful that the truth is finally prevailing.”Bush's 2005 season was one of the greatest of recent college football, as he rushed for 1,740 yards on 200 carries for a whopping 8.7 yards-per-carry average.  The Trojans were undefeated for 12 games before Texas vanquished them  in an epic Rose Bowl game , 41-38.Bush was the  second overall pick of the 2006 NFL  d raft  by the New Orleans Saints, launching an 11-season pro career that also included stops in Miami, Detroit, San Francisco and Buffalo. Injuries limited Bush to just 70 carries in the 2009 regular season — though he came through in a huge moment of that season's NFC title game, scoring a late TD on a 5-yard pass from Drew Brees.The Saints won that game, and two weeks later, they captured  the franchise's only Super Bowl  title  by beating the Indianapolis Colts.While Bush never regained the electricity of his USC days, he still logged some productive seasons, particularly in his career's later stages.He rushed for 1,086 yards for the Dolphins in 2011 and ran for 1,005 yards for Detroit in 2013.Younger football fans and those who don't follow sports might know Bush best for dating reality TV star Kim Kardashian. He even appeared on a handful of  ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians""  episodes.

Liz Szabo,"Hospitalized women are less likely to die or be readmitted to the hospital if they are treated by female doctors, a study published Monday in the  Annals of Internal Medicine  found. In the study of people ages 65 and older, 8.15% of  women treated by female physicians  died within 30 days, compared with 8.38% of women treated by male physicians. Although the difference between the two groups seems small, the researchers say erasing the gap could save 5,000 women’s lives each year. The study included nearly 800,000 male and female patients hospitalized from 2016 through 2019. All patients were covered by Medicare. For male hospitalized patients, the gender of the doctor didn’t appear to have an effect on risk of death or hospital readmission.The data alone doesn’t explain why women fare better when treated by other women. But other studies suggest that women are less likely to experience “miscommunication, misunderstanding and bias” when treated by female doctors, said lead study author Dr. Atsushi Miyawaki, a senior assistant professor of health services research at the University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine.The new research is part of a growing field of study examining why women and minorities tend to receive worse medical care than men and white patients. For example, women and  minority patients  are up to 30%  more likely to be misdiagnosed  than white men.“Our pain and our symptoms are often dismissed,” said Dr. Megan Ranney, dean of the Yale School of Public Health. “It may be that women physicians are more aware of that and are more empathetic.”Research shows that women are less likely than men to receive intensive care but more likely to report having negative experiences with health care, having their concerns dismissed, and having their heart or pain symptoms ignored, the authors wrote in the new study. Male physicians are also more likely than female doctors  to underestimate women’s risk of stroke .Part of the problem, Miyawaki said, is that medical students get “limited training in women’s health issues.”Dr. Ronald Wyatt, who is Black, said his 27-year-old daughter recently had trouble getting an accurate diagnosis for her shortness of breath. An emergency room physician told her the problem was caused by asthma. It took two more trips to the emergency room for his daughter to learn that she actually had a blood clot in her lungs, a potentially life-threatening situation.“There is a tendency for doctors to harbor sexist stereotypes about women, regardless of age, such as the notion that women’s symptoms are more emotional or their pain is less severe or more psychological in origin,” said Wyatt, former chief science and chief medical officer at the Society to Improve Diagnosis in Medicine, a nonprofit research and advocacy group.Women seem to experience fewer of these problems when treated by other women.For example, a study published  JAMA Surgery in 2021  found that women patients developed fewer complications if their surgeon was female. Another  JAMA Surgery study published in 2023  found all patients had fewer complications and shorter hospital stays if they were operated on by female surgeons, who worked more slowly than their male counterparts.Women primary care doctors also tend to  spend more time with their patients , Ranney said. Although that extra attention is great for patients, it also means that women see fewer patients per day and earn less, on average, than male doctors.Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, said several studies suggest that female doctors  follow medical evidence and guidelines , and that their patients  have better outcomes. “There’s lots of variation between women and men physicians,” said Jha, who was not involved in the new study. Women “tend to be better at communication, listening to patients, speaking openly. Patients report that communication is better. You put these things together, and you can understand why there are small but important differences.”The authors of the study said it’s also possible that women are more forthcoming about sensitive issues with female physicians, allowing them to make more informed diagnoses.That doesn’t mean that women should switch doctors, said Dr. Preeti Malani, a professor of medicine at the University of Michigan. For an individual patient, the differences in mortality and readmission rates seen in the new study are tiny.“It would be a mistake to suggest that people need to find physicians of the same gender or race as themselves,” Jha said. “The bigger issue is that we need to understand why these differences exist.”Malani said she’s curious about what women doctors are doing to prevent patients from needing to be readmitted soon after discharge. “How much care and thought is going into that discharge plan?” Malani asked. “Is that where women are succeeding? What can we learn about cultural humility and asking the right questions?”Others aren’t convinced that the new study proves a physician’s gender makes a big difference.Few hospitalized patients are treated by a single doctor, said Dr. Hardeep Singh, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and a patient safety researcher at the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center.Hospital patients are treated by teams of physicians, especially if they need specialist care, in addition to nurses and other professionals, Singh said.“How often do you see the same doc every day in the hospital?” Singh asked. “The point is that it’s not a one-man or one-woman show. Outcomes are unlikely to depend on one individual, but rather on a clinical team and the local context of care. … One name may appear on your bill, but the care is team-based.”However, Singh said his research on misdiagnoses shows that doctors in general need to do a better job listening to patients.Jha said he’d like the health system to learn what women doctors are doing right when they treat other women, then teach all physicians to practice that way.“We should train everyone to be better at generating trust and being worthy of trust,” Jha said.Wyatt said the country needs to take several steps to better care for women patients, including “de-biasing training” to teach doctors to overcome stereotypes. The health care system also needs to increase the number of women physicians in leadership, recruit more female doctors and do a better job at retaining them. All physicians also need more understanding of how adverse childhood experiences affect patient health, particularly for women, he said.“More than once I’ve had white female patients tell me they came to be because I listened and they trusted me,” Wyatt said.",2024-04-23 00:09:00 AM EEST,NBC,"Women are less likely to die when treated by female doctors, study suggests",https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/women-are-less-likely-die-treated-female-doctors-study-suggests-rcna148254
"Sarah Fitzpatrick,Chelsea Damberg,David K. Li","The Justice Department agreed to pay more than $138 million to victims of disgraced sports physician Larry Nassar and apologized for the FBI's failing to act on warnings about the convicted sex abuser, officials said Tuesday.The ""FBI failed to conduct an adequate investigation of Nassar’s conduct,"" Acting Associate Attorney General Benjamin Mizer said in announcing the $138.7 million settlement.“For decades, Lawrence Nassar abused his position, betraying the trust of those under his care and medical supervision while skirting accountability,” Mizer said. “These allegations should have been taken seriously from the outset. While these settlements won’t undo the harm Nassar inflicted, our hope is that they will help give the victims of his crimes some of the critical support they need to continue healing.”It was reported last week that the Justice Department was  expected to pay around $100 million .The announcement is a culmination of several years of internal probes which concluded that FBI agents in Indianapolis made “ fundamental errors ” by failing to notify other FBI offices or state or local authorities about Nassar.A 2021 report by Inspector General Michael Horowitz blasted  Indianapolis-based agents, saying officials at that field office ""did not take responsibility for their failures"" and instead ""provided incomplete and inaccurate information to make it appear that they had been diligent in responding to the sexual abuse allegations.""The settlement came after two years of long and complex negotiations between Nassar's victims and the Justice Department, according to multiple sources familiar with the drawn-out talks.   ""It was a tough negotiation. I think they [DOJ] understood what happened and the gravity of it,"" one source told NBC News. ""There was a real acknowledgment by DOJ that something went very wrong here and they were reasonable in coming to an agreement.""Attorney John Manly, who represents more than two dozen of of Nassar's victims, said he's still waiting to hear from former  FBI director James Comey , who ran the bureau from 2013 to 2017.""The thing I think is very troubling here, despite numerous requests, the man running the FBI at the time, Jim Comey, has never explained what happened or how this occurred,"" said Manly, whose clients include Olympians McKayla Maroney and Aly Raisman.  Comey could not be immediately reached for comment on Tuesday afternoon.Funds have already been apportioned per claimant with the various amounts determined on a case-by-case basis, multiple sources familiar with negotiations told NBC News.   Those funds are expected to be dispersed within the next two months.“The survivors of Larry Nassar’s abuse were betrayed by the institutions they should have been able to trust. At a time when these athletes were in grave need of help, the FBI indefensibly failed to do its job,” U.S. Sen Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said in statement.Grassley is a minority member of the  Senate Judiciary Committee . “Though the past can never be undone, today’s settlement is an important step to bringing about some justice for what these athletes have suffered,"" the lawmaker added. ""I once again commend the survivors for their bravery and poise, and for courageously speaking out about their experiences. Their steadfast fight for change has forged a better future for the athletes and young women who follow in their footsteps.”Tuesday's deal is the latest in a string of civil settlements acknowledging institutional failures when victims first raised red flags about Nassar.Michigan State University, where Nassar worked,  agreed to pay $500 million  in 2018 to women and girls who were assaulted by him.USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee  reached a $380 million deal  with victims in 2021.The settlement announced Tuesday will resolve 139 claims made against the FBI, according to the DOJ.Attorneys Megan Bonanni and Michael Pitt, who represent 77 of those 139 claimants, said the settlement will hold ""the DOJ and FBI accountable for their failures.""

"Aria Bendix,Katie Mogg","How old is considered old?The answer to that question appears to be changing as people live longer, retire later and maintain higher levels of physical and mental health into their older years.A study  published Monday  suggests that people in their mid-60s believe old age starts at 75 — but the older people get, the later they think it begins. The research, published in the American Psychological Association’s Psychology and Aging journal, examined data from around 14,000 participants in the German Aging Survey, which studies old age as a stage of life in Germany. The participants were born between 1911 and 1974 and entered the survey at ages 40 to 85. The people studied reported their perceptions of old age up to eight times over 25 years. For every four to five years that passed, participants reported that old age started a year later compared to their last assessment.Participants who were born earlier — from 1911 to 1935 — thought that old age started earlier compared with participants born after 1935. “Our perceptions or conceptions of old age are obviously shifting across historical time. People nowadays who are in midlife or who are older adults believe that old age begins later than did their peers 10 or 20 years ago,” said Markus Wettstein, the study’s lead author and a psychologist at Humboldt University of Berlin.Wettstein said the change could be due, in part, to increases in life expectancy: German life expectancy is  around 81 years at birth , up from 71 years in 1974. Many people in Germany are also living healthier lives for longer. Studies have shown improvements in  heart health ,  cognitive abilities  and  overall quality of life  in the country's older population over time. “People who feel younger also believe that old age starts later,” Wettstein said.Participants in the study who were lonelier, had more chronic diseases or reported being in poorer health were more likely to believe that old age started earlier. Women, on average, thought that old age started around 2.4 years later than men did.However, Jacqui Smith, a psychology professor at the University of Michigan who was not involved in the research, cautioned that the results may not apply to other countries, since cultural views of aging and historical trends vary between communities. In the U.S., for instance, life expectancy declined during the Covid pandemic, from 79 years in 2019 to 76 in 2021 — whereas Germany's life expectancy has been fairly consistent since 2014.Still, Smith said, the study offers insight into how people's perspectives on aging change as they get older.“A lot of the work that we see in the literature is only taking a single snapshot of this phenomenon, a single point in time,” she said. “What this study is adding is that it’s comparing different people who were born at different times who’ve clearly gone through many different historical changes in their life.”John Rowe, a professor of health policy and aging at Columbia University, said he found the results encouraging.“I would say that this confirms in a very strong way, at least in Germany, that 70 is the new 60,” said Rowe, who also wasn’t involved in the study.He theorized that people may be starting to shed some negative stereotypes about older people and view them instead as more capable or agile than in the past. However, both Rowe and Wettstein also said that some people in the study may have deliberately excluded themselves from the old age category because they saw it as undesirable.“Some people have such a negative views of the elderly that they don’t want to be associated with them,” Rowe said. “So if they’re 70 years old, they’ll say old age begins at 75. And when they get to 75, they’ll say old age begins at 80.”Of course, age doesn’t always correlate with health status.“We can’t equate any sort of general transition in age to the way that people are actually functioning,” Smith said. However, people’s perceptions of aging could affect their health. Past research has shown that negative beliefs about getting older are  linked to higher stress levels , which in turn may increase the risk of heart attack or stroke. Studies have conversely shown that people with positive views of aging are  less likely to develop dementia  and  tend to live longer  than people with more negative views of aging. People who see themselves as younger than their actual age have also exhibited  slower memory declines ,  better cognitive performance and reduced symptoms of depression , while people who perceive themselves as older have a  higher risk of mortality .",2024-04-23 00:20:00 AM EEST,NBC,When does 'old age' begin?

"Aria Bendix,Joe Murphy","This year's measles case total is now the highest of the last five years. The United States has  seen 125 cases  across 17 states as of Thursday — its largest annual tally since 2019, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.From January to March, the U.S. recorded  around 30% of the total cases seen since the beginning of 2020 , according to  a CDC report  released earlier this month.The authors warned that the rapid increase in cases ""represents a renewed threat to elimination.""Most cases reported this year were  linked to international travel , and the majority were among people who had not received a measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine or whose vaccination status was unknown.Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective, but the CDC said in an  advisory  to health care providers   last month that ""pockets of low [vaccination] coverage leave some communities at higher risk for outbreaks.""This year's early spike in measles cases was driven in part by outbreaks centered in a  migrant shelter in Chicago , an  elementary school in southeast Florida  and a  children’s hospital and a day care center in Philadelphia .Chicago continues to confront its outbreak. As of Monday, its  case count had reached 63 , with the most recent recorded last week. More than half of the cases were among children under age 5.Though disease experts have expressed concern about the early rise in cases, the U.S. isn’t close to its total from 2019, when the country nearly lost its measles elimination status. Most of the 1,249 cases that year were associated with  outbreaks in Orthodox Jewish communities  in New York.Measles is highly contagious: An infected person can spread it to  up to 90% of people close to them  if those contacts aren’t immune. Thanks to widespread vaccination, measles was eliminated in the U.S. in 2000 — meaning that it’s no longer constantly present, though there are still occasional outbreaks. Most people who get measles now are unvaccinated. Children in the U.S. are meant to get their first vaccine dose between 12 and 15 months and their second between 4 and 6 years old. However, vaccination rates have fallen in the last few years. For nearly a decade, 95% of U.S. kindergartners had received two doses of the MMR vaccine. That rate fell to 94% in the 2020–21 year, then to 93% in the 2022–23 school year.Measles symptoms usually start  with a high fever, cough, conjunctivitis (pink eye) and runny nose. Two to three days later, people may notice tiny white spots in their mouth. On days three to five of symptoms, a blotchy rash often forms at the hairline before spreading to the rest of the body.Some people may  develop severe complications  from measles, including pneumonia, swelling of the brain or a secondary bacterial infection. Before measles vaccines became available in 1963, around 48,000 people were hospitalized and 400 to 500 people died of the disease each year in the U.S. Today,  1 in 5 unvaccinated people  who get measles are hospitalized, and roughly 1 to 3 out of every 1,000 children with measles die from respiratory and neurological complications, according to the CDC.",2024-03-27 20:54:00 PM EET,NBC,This year's measles case total is now the highest in the U.S. since 2019,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/us-measles-cases-2024-so-far-rcna145013
Associated Press,"The medical records of women will be shielded from criminal investigations if they cross state lines to seek an  abortion  where it is legal, under a new rule that the Biden administration finalized Monday.The regulation, which is intended to protect women who live in states  where abortion is illegal  from prosecution, is almost certain to face legal challenges from anti-abortion advocates and criticism from abortion-rights advocates that it does not go far enough.“No one should have their medical records used against them, their doctor or their loved one just because they sought or received lawful reproductive health care,” Jennifer Klein, the director of the White House Gender Policy Council, told reporters on Monday.The new regulation is an update to the  Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act  of 1996, which prohibits medical providers and health insurers from divulging medical information about patients. Typically, however, law enforcement can access those records for investigations.In states with strict abortion rules, the federal regulation would essentially prohibit state or local officials from gathering medical records related to reproductive health care for a civil, criminal or administrative investigation from providers or health insurers in a state where abortion remains legal.In theory, it would provide the most cover to women who leave states with strict bans to seek an abortion from a medical provider in a state that allows it.“As someone who does see patients who travel from all across the country at our health center in D.C., it’s a reality. I’ve had patients ask ... are there going to be consequences for me when I go home?” said Dr. Serina Floyd, an OB-GYN who provides abortions in Washington.Women who also seek fertility, contraception or miscarriage care will also be protected, the nation’s top health official  Xavier Becerra  said Monday.A group of  19 Republican Attorneys General, all from states with strict abortion laws,  urged the Health and Human Services agency to ditch the rule when a draft was released last year. The regulation “would unlawfully interfere with states' authority to enforce their laws, and does not serve any legitimate need,” they wrote in a letter to HHS last year.“Relying as it does on a false view of state regulation of abortion, the proposed rule is a solution in search of a problem,” the letter said.But the new regulation does not go as far as protecting women from criminal investigations when they order abortion pills online,  as has become increasingly common . For example, it would not safeguard medical records of a patient who orders an abortion pill while at her home in a state like Mississippi, where abortion is mostly banned, from a provider in Illinois, where abortion is legal.The rule also does not require law enforcement officials to obtain a warrant for any medical records of patients,  a rule change some Democrats had sought from the administration . Instead, law enforcement can seek a subpoena, court order or an administrative request to obtain medical records.Becerra acknowledged to reporters that the regulation has limitations — and may be challenged legally.“Until we have a national law that reinstitutes Roe v. Wade, we’re going to have issues,” Becerra said. “But that doesn’t stop us from doing everything we can to protect every Americans’ right to access the care they need.”At least 22 Democratic-controlled states have laws or executive orders that seek to protect medical providers or patients who participate in abortion from investigations by law enforcement in states with bans. Medical providers in some of those states are prescribing abortion pills via telehealth to women in states with abortion bans.It’s not clear that public officials have sought those medical records of patients around abortion. But last year,  Texas officials demanded records  from at least two out-of-state health centers that provide gender-affirming care. Texas, like most other Republican-controlled states, has a ban on gender-affirming care for minors.",2024-04-23 16:45:00 PM EEST,NBC,Biden administration tightens rules for obtaining medical records related to abortion,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/abortion-related-medical-records-protected-rcna148946
"Caroline Kee, TODAY","In early April, a  dairy worker in Texas  tested positive for avian influenza, also known as bird flu, amid a multi-state outbreak of the virus among cows. The bird flu virus has also been detected in raw milk, but authorities say the current risk to the public is low.It’s the first time this strain of bird flu —  referred to as highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1 ) — has been detected in cattle and the first documented cow-to-human transmission of an avian influenza virus,  according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The person in Texas is only the second case of bird flu in a human ever reported in the United States.While there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, health officials are on high alert.In a  recent press conference , a leading expert at the World Health Organization called the risk of the bird flu spreading to humans “an enormous concern.” Speaking to reporters on April 18, WHO chief scientist Dr. Jeremy Farrar warned that bird flu viruses are increasingly infecting mammals.“The great concern ... is that the virus evolves and develops the ability to infect humans and then critically, the ability to go from human-to-human transmission,” Farrar said.<h2>Is bird flu a problem now?</h2>The current bird flu outbreak is affecting cows in over a dozen dairy farms across the country. Although the risk to humans is considered low, health officials are calling for increased monitoring of infected animals and people exposed to them.While the thought of “bird flu” may sound alarming and stoke Covid-19 pandemic fears, influenza among birds is not new.“The current bird flu strain that we’re concerned with, H5N1, has actually been circulating around the world for quite some time,” said Dr. William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.H5N1 is widespread among wild birds and is causing an ongoing outbreak among poultry in the U.S., according to the CDC.<h2>What is bird flu?</h2>Bird flu is a disease caused by infection with avian influenza type A viruses.  Avian influenza A viruses  occur naturally among wild aquatic birds, such as geese, ducks and swans, Schaffner said, but they can also circulate among domestic poultry.“Bird flu viruses occasionally get into other mammalian species (like pigs). We’ve all heard of swine flu,” Schaffner said. Avian influenza A viruses can also infect horses, bats and dogs,  per the CDC  — rarely, they spread to humans.“More recently, we have seen an increase of infections in cattle,” said Dr. Hilary M. Babcock, infectious disease specialist at Washington University of St. Louis and BJC Healthcare.This is the first time the avian influenza strain of highly pathogenic H5N1, which causes severe and often fatal disease in birds, has been found in cows. “That’s pretty unusual,” said Schaffner. However, this H5N1 strain does not seem to be making cows very sick, he added.<h2>What states have bird flu?</h2>Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (which include the strain of H5N1 that’s currently spreading) have been detected in the U.S. in wild aquatic birds, commercial poultry and backyard bird flocks beginning in January 2022, according to the CDC.Overall,  48 states  have reported cases of highly pathogenic H5N1.The current outbreak of H5N1 affecting cows has spread to eight states so far, per  the U.S. Department of Agriculture . As of April 11, cases have been reported among dairy herds in:Currently, only one human in Texas is known to have contracted H5N1 in this outbreak, experts say.There have been only two human cases of H5N1 in the U.S. ever, said Babcock — the first case was detected  in Colorado in 2022  in a person who had direct contact with infected poultry.As H5N1 surveillance increases, experts anticipate the number of cases among cows to increase. “We’re looking harder now and finding more cases (among cattle) that even 10 years ago would have gone undetected,” Schaffner said.The risk to the general public in the U.S. is low, experts say. For people exposed due to their line of work, the risk is considered “low-to-moderate,” the  World Health Organization said in a statement .<h2>How does the bird flu spread to humans?</h2>“Every once in a while, a bird flu virus can get into a human, but that’s rare,” Schaffner said. Avian influenza viruses can spread from infected birds to humans in a few ways,  according to the CDC :Infected birds can shed the virus in their saliva, nasal secretions, mucus and feces. People can become infected when a large enough amount of the virus gets into the mouth, nose, eyes or is inhaled, Schaffner said.Transmission to humans typically occurs through close contact with infected birds without protective gear. It can also occur if a person touches contaminated surfaces and puts their hands in their eyes or mouth or if they breathe in droplets from the air, per the CDC.It was not immediately clear how the dairy cow infected the person in Texas, experts note. The only other person who contracted H5N1 in the U.S. was directly involved in the culling of birds presumed to be infected with H5N1, said Babcock.Sporadic cases of H5N1 in humans have been reported around the world, often in rural areas where people live closely with poultry or other birds. According to the  WHO , since 2003 there have been 889 cases and 463 deaths caused by H5N1 in 23 countries.Once the bird flu gets into a human, “it is almost never spread to anyone else,” said Schaffner. However, “there are ultra-rare instances of transmission from a person very sick with bird flu to a family member or caregiver.”No human-to-human spread has occurred with the contemporary H5N1 viruses currently spreading in birds,  the CDC said .When this does happen, it does not lead to continued spread between people “because the virus doesn’t have the (genetic) capacity to spread easily from person to person,” Schaffner said.“This strain of bird flu has been around for about a decade and it still has not picked up this capacity to spread readily from person to person, thankfully. ... That should be a matter of reassurance, but also keep us in public health on alert,” said Schaffner.<h2>Can you get bird flu through eggs?</h2>There is no evidence that people can get bird flu from food that’s been properly prepared and cooked, and it is safe to eat eggs, chicken and beef, and drink pasteurized milk, experts say.“We have not seen cases that have been from ingesting animal products or animals that may have been infected,” said Babcock.The infected dairy cow herds that have been detected are in quarantine and their milk is being destroyed, Schaffner said.In a statement , the USDA said the commercial milk supply in the U.S. remains safe.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said  it does not currently have concerns about the safety of pasteurized milk products, including pasteurized cheese.“The pasteurization process in the U.S. keeps our milk supply very safe,” Babcock said. Pasteurization heats the milk to a high enough temperature to kill bacteria and viruses, including influenza.Drinking unpasteurized or “raw” milk, which is increasingly trendy, is associated with various infectious disease hazards, Schaffner said. “I discourage people from drinking raw milk,” he added.The risk of humans becoming  infected by eating eggs  from poultry with H5N1 is low,  the FDA  says, and there are safeguards in place to identify infected poultry and remove their eggs from the market.It’s possible for products from infected animals to end up in the food supply, said Babcock, but the risk to humans is still very low. Properly storing and cooking food further reduces that risk.Although beef cattle are not involved in this outbreak, Schaffner recommends cooking beef to a safe internal temperature. The  FDA recommends  cooking eggs until the white and yolk are firm.“There are other reasons that you shouldn’t eat raw eggs (or meat), because these can carry lots of different pathogens,” Babcock said.<h2>What happens if a human gets the bird flu?</h2>Bird flu infections in humans can range in severity, experts note. Some people have zero or only mild symptoms, while others develop severe disease, according to  the CDC . “It can be a serious infection with a high mortality rate,” Schaffner said.The Texas patient had a mild infection, with eye redness as the only symptom,  the CDC said . “It was not even a respiratory infection. It was ... conjunctivitis or pink eye,” Schaffner noted.The patient was treated with flu antivirals and is recovering. “We have antiviral medications, the same ones we use to treat regular flu, that work against this avian influenza strain,” Schaffner said.The other human case of H5N1 in the U.S. in 2022 was a mild infection as well, Babcock added.<h2>Symptoms of bird flu in humans</h2>According to the CDC  and experts, the reported signs and symptoms of avian influenza in humans include:Bird flu in humans may look similar to a regular flu or upper respiratory infection, said Babcock, or a person may have no obvious symptoms. It can also lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure and other complications. “There’s a full range,” she added.There is no way to diagnose an infection with bird flu by symptoms alone, the CDC says. Laboratory testing is required.<h2>Can you recover from bird flu?</h2>Yes, you can recover from bird flu. The person recently infected in Texas was treated with flu antivirals and is recovering. The Colorado patient infected in 2022 also recovered.Globally, bird flu symptoms have ranged from mild to severe, resulting in death in some cases, according to the CDC.<h2>How to prevent spread of bird flu</h2>Although the risk of getting bird flu is low, the CDC recommends the following protective actions:",2024-04-23 06:59:00 AM EEST,NBC,"As bird flu spreads in the U.S., is it safe to eat eggs?

The Associated Press,"Doctors have transplanted a pig kidney into a New Jersey woman who was near death, part of a dramatic pair of surgeries that also stabilized her failing heart.Lisa Pisano’s combination of heart and kidney failure left her too sick to qualify for a traditional transplant, and out of options. Then doctors at NYU Langone Health devised a novel one-two punch: Implant a mechanical pump to keep her heart beating and days later transplant a kidney from a genetically modified pig.Pisano is recovering well, the NYU team announced Wednesday. She’s only the second patient ever to receive a pig kidney — following a landmark transplant  last month at Massachusetts General Hospital  — and the latest in a string of attempts to make animal-to-human transplantation a reality.This week, the 54-year-old grasped a walker and took her first few steps.“I was at the end of my rope,” Pisano told The Associated Press. “I just took a chance. And you know, worst case scenario, if it didn’t work for me, it might have worked for someone else and it could have helped the next person.”Dr. Robert Montgomery, director of NYU Langone Transplant Institute, recounted cheers in the operating room as the organ immediately started making urine.“It’s been transformative,” Montgomery said of the experiment’s early results.But “we’re not off the hook yet,” cautioned Dr. Nader Moazami, the NYU cardiac surgeon who implanted the heart pump.“With this surgery I get to see my wife smile again,” Pisano’s husband Todd said Wednesday.Other transplant experts are closely watching how the patient fares.“I have to congratulate them,” said Dr. Tatsuo Kawai of Mass General, who noted that his own pig kidney patient was healthier overall going into his operation than NYU’s patient. “When the heart function is bad, it’s really difficult to do a kidney transplant.”<h2>The pig organ quest</h2>More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant waiting list, most who need a kidney, and thousands die waiting. In hopes of filling the shortage of donated organs, several biotech companies are genetically modifying pigs so their organs are more humanlike, less likely to be destroyed by people’s immune system.NYU and other research teams have temporarily transplanted pig kidneys and hearts  into brain-dead bodies, with promising results . Then the University of Maryland transplanted pig hearts into two men who were out of other options, and  both died within months .Mass General’s pig kidney transplant last month raised new hopes. Kawai said Richard “Rick” Slayman experienced an early rejection scare but bounced back enough to go home earlier this month and still is faring well five weeks post-transplant. A recent biopsy showed no further problems.<h2>A complex case at NYU</h2>Pisano is the first woman to receive a pig organ — and unlike with prior xenotransplant experiments, both her heart and kidneys had failed. She went into cardiac arrest and had to be resuscitated before the experimental surgeries. She’d gotten too weak to even play with her grandchildren. “I was miserable,” the Cookstown, New Jersey, woman said.A failed heart made her ineligible for a traditional kidney transplant. But while on dialysis, she didn’t qualify for a heart pump, called a left ventricular assist device or LVAD, either.“It’s like being in a maze and you can’t find a way out,” Montgomery explained — until the surgeons decided to pair a heart pump with a pig kidney.<h2>Two surgeries in eight days</h2>With emergency permission from the Food and Drug Administration, Montgomery chose an organ from a pig genetically engineered by United Therapeutics Corp. so its cells don’t produce a particular sugar that’s foreign to the human body and triggers immediate organ rejection.Plus a tweak: The donor pig’s thymus gland, which trains the immune system, was attached to the donated kidney in hopes that it would help Pisano’s body tolerate the new organ.Surgeons implanted the LVAD to power Pisano’s heart on April 4, and transplanted the pig kidney on April 12. There’s no way to predict her long-term outcome but she’s shown no sign of organ rejection so far, Montgomery said. And in adjusting the LVAD to work with her new kidney, Moazami said doctors already have learned lessons that could help future care of heart-and-kidney patients.Special “compassionate use” experiments teach doctors a lot but it will take rigorous studies to prove if xenotransplants really work. What happens with Pisano and Mass General’s kidney recipient will undoubtedly influence FDA’s decision to allow such trials. United Therapeutics said it hopes to begin one next year.",2024-04-24 18:45:00 PM EEST,NBC,Doctors combine a pig kidney transplant and a heart device in bid to extend a woman’s life,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/doctors-combine-pig-kidney-transplant-heart-device-rcna149166
Abigail Brooks,"A progressive watchdog group sent letters Tuesday asking attorneys general in five states to investigate the privacy practices of  crisis pregnancy centers , arguing they could be misleading patients with claims that sensitive medical data is protected by health privacy laws, according to copies of the letters obtained by NBC News. While the letters don’t allege misuse of private health information the pregnancy centers collect, they ask the attorneys general to investigate what they use the information for and whether crisis pregnancy centers are using it to further anti-abortion goals.The letters, sent by the Campaign for Accountability, allege that the centers, which try to dissuade pregnant women from seeking abortions, gather sensitive and private medical information as part of their appointment scheduling processes. The letters asked the attorneys general of  Idaho ,  Minnesota ,  New Jersey,   Pennsylvania  and  Washington  to use their investigative power to probe why crisis pregnancy centers are gathering and retaining sensitive medical information and what they do with it — and potentially charge the centers with violating state consumer protection laws. The centers, which provide counseling and services for women coping with unplanned pregnancies, say on their websites that they comply with the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, known as  HIPAA , as a promise that the information is protected and kept confidential.However, because the centers offer services for free, they are not legally bound by federal health data privacy laws, creating a privacy risk that could be exploited in the wake of efforts to criminalize abortion, according to the letters.At the time of publication, the pregnancy centers discussed in the letters from Campaign for Accountability had not responded to a list of questions. The letters, signed by the group’s executive director, Michelle Kuppersmith, argue “women are guaranteed no actual privacy protection   when they hand over highly sensitive information about their pregnancies or reproductive health.” The practice is “particularly disturbing given some neighboring states’ desires to prosecute women who travel to seek abortion —   including to states where abortion remains legal,” Kuppersmith writes.Andrea Swartzendruber, an associate professor of biostatistics at the University of Georgia College of Public Health who studies crisis pregnancy centers, said: “They have so much information about the people who go to crisis pregnancy centers. There is some language in those forms that is completely problematic in the hands of crisis pregnancy centers.”Susannah Baruch, executive director of the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology and Bioethics at Harvard Law School, said claiming to be HIPAA-compliant while actually not being regulated by the federal privacy law could leave consumers whose data is shared without their consent with no recourse.“There can be enforcement mechanisms against an entity that doesn’t do what the privacy rule requires, assuming that entity is covered by the HIPAA privacy rule,” said Baruch, who said it would be difficult for “visitors to enforce their rights, because this is not an entity against whom they can sort of claim the protections and HIPAA privacy rules.”While many crisis pregnancy centers offer free services, such as pregnancy tests and ultrasound scans, as well as counseling, reproductive health doctors say many of them also provide  misleading or false information , such as linking abortion to mental illness or infertility, meant to discourage or prevent women from receiving abortion care. The rise of crisis pregnancy centersCommunity-based pregnancy centers began to crop up around the country in the 1960s. As the anti-abortion movement gained momentum after Roe v. Wade, religious activists began organizing them into national networks. Eventually, the centers shifted to take on the appearance of medical facilities to attract women seeking abortions and “impact a woman’s decision to choose life,” according to the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, the organization that introduced ultrasound technology into crisis pregnancy centers. However, the centers are not subject to the same standards as health facilities, and they are often unregulated by state health departments, which can lead to confusion over what services they actually offer: Women who are seeking abortions mistakenly schedule appointments at facilities that will try to counsel them against the procedure.There are more than 2,500 crisis pregnancy centers across the country, compared to just over 800 abortion clinics, according to the Guttmacher Institute,   a research group that supports access to abortion.   There have been attempts to restrict the centers by requiring them to display written notices informing women about abortion access. In 2018, the Supreme Court ruled the efforts  violated the First Amendment .Questioning whether crisis pregnancy centers engage in deceptive privacy practices is an approach that the Campaign for Accountability hopes will prove more effective.“CPCs are playing an increasing role in the anti-choice movement’s strategy,” Kuppersmith said. “Given the prevalence of these centers and their efforts to reach minors and other often low-income women, their activities merit close scrutiny.”Collecting dataThe crisis pregnancy centers discussed in the letters, like many across the country, are affiliated with Care Net and Heartbeat International, major pregnancy-center networks that describe themselves as religious ministries. In return for affiliation fees, pregnancy centers receive training, digital support and digital forms used to collect client information from women who interact with their facilities.“We believe we are better together, and our center management software reflects that by collecting data, across the pregnancy help movement, on critical metrics to provide powerful, actionable insights at the local level,” Heartbeat International writes on its website.Baruch, of Harvard Law School, said: “Many of the crisis pregnancy centers are part of networks, and they’re sharing the information up to the networks, which are there to try to reduce the number of people accessing abortion. We don’t know exactly what they would do with the information.”The Campaign for Accountability asks the same question in the letters, writing, “This raises the question of why”   crisis pregnancy centers are “gathering and retaining this highly sensitive medical and personal information and what the group does with this information.”Much of the data is collected on pregnancy centers’ websites, which prompt prospective clients to make appointments, much as they would for doctors’ visits. The online intake forms ask for private information such as first and last name, phone number, email address, date of birth, first day of last period and, in some cases, interest in obtaining abortion care and interest in specific pregnancy services. Voluntary complianceWebsites for the centers say they are “fully HIPAA-compliant.” Some of the centers discussed in the letters say in their privacy policies that they are “required by law to maintain the privacy and security of your protected health information” and instruct clients that if they believe their data has been compromised, they can “file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights.”However, in a blog post, Care Net acknowledges that compliance is voluntary, because the pregnancy centers are not actually bound by the federal privacy law.“Most centers do not meet the legal definition of a covered entity under the HIPAA regulation because they do not furnish, bill, or are paid for health care in the normal course of business and do not transmit health information in electronic form in connection with a transaction for which a HIPAA standard has been adopted by HHS,” the  blog post  says.That is also acknowledged in the privacy practices of some of the clinics discussed in the letters from Campaign for Accountability.Sage Women’s Center in Twin Falls, Idaho, writes on its website that “any transactions that invoke coverage of the HIPAA Privacy  Act” and therefore its privacy practices are “voluntarily undertaken.”  “Therefore, nothing in this notice should be construed as creating any contractual or legal rights on behalf of patients,” the privacy policy says.Privacy policies for two of the pregnancy centers say personal data can be disclosed without consent “when required by law, when required for public health reasons” or “when necessary to avert a threat of harm to you or a third person.” Privacy policies for the three others say personal data can be disclosed “as required by law” or “when required to protect our rights or your safety or the safety of others.”In the letters, Kuppersmith urges the attorneys general to investigate whether pregnancy centers could consider “a woman’s decision to seek abortion care as a ‘threat’ to the safety of a fetus and a ‘morally compelling’ reason to break confidentiality.”In their advertising and legal materials, Care Net and Heartbeat International maintain that confidentiality is a priority. “Personal and health information is treated highly confidentially,” Care Net writes  on its website.  “Except in rare cases where information must be shared in compliance with state law for the protection of an endangered child, or to protect the client or others from physical harm, client information is held in the strictest confidence.”A legal manual for Care Net and Heartbeat International pregnancy centers obtained by NBC News says: “For non-medical pregnancy centers, the confidentiality policy is primarily ethical, not legal.  “Nevertheless, because centers voluntarily promise confidentiality, centers could be held legally liable should such confidentiality be breached for inappropriate reasons.”In a  blog post , Care Net says its “pregnancy centers agree to respect client/patient privacy, and medical centers adhere to and distribute a notice of privacy practices modeled on HIPAA.” “Centers readily comply with all applicable confidentiality and HIPAA regulations that apply to many abortion clinics, retail clinics, and other physician’s offices,” the blog post says. “Care Net will disaffiliate any center that persists in violating or is unwilling to comply with our standards of affiliation.”In a statement to NBC News, Jor-El Godsey, president of Heartbeat International, said, “Pregnancy help organizations comply with all applicable laws, including state-level data privacy laws and applicable HIPAA provisions.”“For centers, confidentiality is so much more than merely complying with the law. It’s about serving her well, which includes safeguarding her private information and honoring her trust — hence the ethical duty to maintain confidentiality,” Godsey said. “Because our services are free of charge making HIPAA not applicable, confidentiality is of the utmost importance.”  At the time of publication, Care Net had not responded to a list of questions.On Monday, the Biden administration announced  new rules to strengthen HIPAA  to offer more legal protections for people who obtain or provide abortion care in states where it is legal to do so. The final policy prohibits health care organizations from disclosing private health information to state officials to conduct investigations or prosecute patients or providers. The new rule does not apply to crisis pregnancy centers, a Department of Health and Human Services official said.“Generally, a crisis pregnancy center that provides services for free and does not bill health insurance does not meet the definition of a covered entity under HIPAA and therefore the HIPAA Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules (‘HIPAA Rules’) do not apply,” the official told NBC News in an email.There is precedent for penalizing companies for misleading consumers about why their reproductive health information is being collected and how it is being shared. In 2021, the Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint alleging Flo, a period- and pregnancy-tracking app, shared millions of users’ data with third-party companies, despite having promised users their data would stay private.A group of Senate Democrats has tried to get answers about how crisis pregnancy center networks use and protect such data before, having sent a letter to Heartbeat International highlighting concerns that the data could be used in abortion-related prosecutions. In response, the organization declined to “respond materially” to questions about how and with whom it shares client data, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said in a news release, but it posted on its website that it has never “had a security breach related to client information,” maintaining that “any data we collect has always been secure, safe, and legal.”",2024-04-23 18:06:00 PM EEST,NBC,Watchdog group asks 5 attorneys general to investigate crisis pregnancy center privacy practices,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/watchdog-group-asks-5-attorneys-general-investigate-crisis-pregnancy-c-rcna148188
"Berkeley Lovelace Jr.,Erika Edwards","The Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that fragments of the  bird flu virus  had been detected in some samples of pasteurized milk in the U.S. While the agency maintains that the milk is safe to drink, it notes that it is still waiting on the results of studies to confirm this.The findings come less than a month after an outbreak of the H5N1 strain of bird flu was found,  for the first time , in  herds of dairy cows in several states . It has since been detected in herds  in eight states . The FDA has been working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to investigate the outbreak.The fragments of the virus were found while testing samples of pasteurized milk, the FDA said. The testing method, called PCR testing, looks for bits of genetic material; a positive result doesn’t mean that live, infectious virus has been found.“Based on available information, pasteurization is likely to inactivate the virus, however the process is not expected to remove the presence of viral particles,” the agency said in a release that it plans to make public later Tuesday. “To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe.”The FDA is specifically testing whether pasteurization inactivates bird flu in cow milk. The findings will be available in the “next few days to weeks,” it said.As a part of its testing, it will use so-called egg inoculation tests — considered the gold standard for determining if a sample is infectious — in which a chicken egg is injected with a small amount of infected milk and monitored to see if active virus begins to replicate.Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said he was not surprised by the preliminary findings. “If you tested most milk, you’d find E. coli and  listeria  and other things in it, too, but they’d all be dead. Pasteurization doesn’t take them out, it just kills them,” he said. That is, dead particles are unlikely to cause a person to get sick. “I wouldn’t have any problem drinking milk tonight from an influenza standpoint at all,” Osterholm said. “My grandchildren could drink the milk tonight.”But there has been a scarcity of information on the matter coming from the USDA, he said. More data is needed to fully understand what’s going on with the current bird flu virus in dairy cows.“We have a need for a lot of additional information that hasn’t been forthcoming,” Osterholm said. “We don’t know the epidemiology on these farms. We don’t know how many farms, how many samples. We have been very concerned.”The FDA said it has also recommended that milk producers take precautions when discarding milk from sick cows so that the discarded milk does not become a source of spread. One person has been infected during the current outbreak. The person, a  dairy worker in Texas , had a mild case and only developed conjunctivitis, or pinkeye.A senior official at the CDC also said the agency is monitoring the situation for signs of unusual illness in people and has not seen any beyond the Texas case.Still, the virus remains a cause of concern among health officials, given its particularly high mortality rate of around 50%. Bird flu doesn’t spread easily from person to person, but there’s worry that it could mutate as it spreads among cows to a version that spreads more easily among people. So far, there’s no evidence indicating that has happened,  according to the CDC .",2024-04-24 01:47:00 AM EEST,NBC,"Bird flu virus found in pasteurized milk, though officials maintain supply is safe",https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/bird-flu-virus-found-pasteurized-milk-though-officials-maintain-supply-rcna149084
The Associated Press,"DALLAS —  Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton  is dropping a request for a Seattle hospital to hand over records regarding  gender-affirming treatment  potentially given to children from Texas as part of a lawsuit settlement announced Monday.Seattle Children’s Hospital  filed the lawsuit  against Paxton’s office in December in response to the Republican appearing to go beyond state borders to investigate transgender health care. Paxton, a staunch conservative who has helped drive GOP efforts that target the rights of trans people, sent  similar letters to Texas hospitals  last year.The Seattle hospital said in a statement that it had “successfully fought” the “overreaching demands to obtain confidential patient information.” A judge in Austin dismissed the lawsuit Friday, saying the parties had settled their dispute.Texas is among states that have  enacted laws restricting or banning  gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors.The hospital’s lawsuit included a copy of the letter from Paxton’s office, which among other requests asked the hospital to produce records identifying medication given to children who live in Texas; the number of Texas children who received treatment; and documents that identified the “standard protocol or guidance” used for treatment.As part of the settlement, according to court records, the parties agreed that Seattle Children’s Hospital would withdraw its registration to transact business in Texas. But a hospital spokesperson said in a statement that they don’t operate health care facilities or provide gender-affirming care in Texas.In court records, the hospital had previously stated that it had a “limited number” of people who work remotely and live in Texas but that none were involved in gender-affirming care. It also said it did not advertise its services in Texas.“When we merely began asking questions, they decided to leave the State of Texas and forfeit the opportunity to do business here,” Paxton said in a news release Monday. He said Texas will “vigorously protect” children from gender-affirming treatment that he called “damaging.”The Texas law prevents transgender minors from accessing hormone therapies, puberty blockers and transition surgeries, even though medical experts say such surgical procedures are rarely performed on children.In Washington,  Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee  has signed  a law  that aims to protects minors seeking gender-affirming care there, part of  a wave of legislation in Democratic-led states  intended to give refuge to those seeking gender-affirming treatment.",2024-04-23 17:19:00 PM EEST,NBC,Seattle hospital won’t turn over gender-affirming care records in lawsuit settlement with Texas,https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/seattle-hospital-wont-turn-gender-affirming-care-records-lawsuit-settl-rcna148939
"Rosie Colosi, TODAY","April 21-27 is National Infertility Awareness Week. All week, TODAY will be sharing stories to raise awareness of what it is like to experience infertility.In the last 13 years, 37-year-old Emily Westerfield has delivered 10 healthy babies. Three were her own biological children. She acted as a gestational carrier for families of the others. Twice, she carried twins.She is now 28 weeks pregnant with baby No. 11.“I’m probably the unicorn in this industry,” Westerfield tells TODAY.com.Her incredible success in navigating the  surrogacy  experience led her to give birth to  Carrying Dreams , her own full-service agency designed to help egg donors, surrogates and intended parents on their parenting journeys in a way that works best for them.So, would Westerfield consider having baby No. 12?“In a heartbeat,” she says.Westerfield and her husband, Max, live in Celina, Ohio, with their three biological children: Mckenna, 13, Jack, 11, and Charlie, 10.In 2010, Westerfield spent a lot of time bonding with Max’s cousin, who had been having trouble sustaining a pregnancy for years. She was suffering from  secondary infertility  and struggled to bring a pregnancy to term.“She just continuously kept having  loss after loss , and it was heartbreaking,” she says.Westerfield was able to conceive and deliver her three biological children with relative ease, making her feel “guilty” every time she shared the news with her husband’s cousin. Without knowing much about the process of surrogacy, Westerfield offered to be a gestational carrier for the cousin’s embryo.“They did not feel that surrogacy was the path that they wanted to take,” she explains, “but I knew that there were probably so many other people in the world who needed help in a very similar way. Maybe I could help.”Even while she was pregnant with her third (and last) biological child, Westerfield mentioned to her husband that she was interested in becoming a gestational carrier.“I was shot down by him so many times,” Westerfield says with a laugh. “The more and more I shared to educate him, I think the more and more he felt comfortable with it. Or he just got sick of me nagging.”After her son Charlie completed their family, Westerfield activated her search to find another family to assist via surrogacy in earnest. She joined an online forum that no longer exists. “It was almost like a Craigslist of everybody in the infertility community,” she says. Surrogates, egg donors, sperm donors and intended parents used the site to help create families.“I created a profile and just put myself out there,” says Westerfield. “I was overwhelmed with the response and just inundated with emails and queries. The more and more that I got into this, the more I realized there’s so many more people out there that  need  the help than the people that are  willing  to help.”Westerfield had initial conversations with a handful of hopeful parents and ultimately chose a couple that seemed like a good match in terms of personality, age and location. They were an easy three-hour drive away.But the decision wasn’t easy. Each story was more heartbreaking than the one before. The family that Westerfield ultimately decided to help already had two children. During the second birth, the mother needed an emergency hysterectomy, leaving her unable to complete their family with the third child they so desperately wanted.Calling to tell the couple the good news “was so emotionally overwhelming and exciting and nerve-wracking, all at the same time.” Using the embryos the couple had already created, Westerfield delivered their third child, a girl, in December 2015.“And that’s when everything started,” Westerfield says.Westerfield has had three miscarriages and 11 live births. She was induced and had vaginal deliveries each time.Courtesy Emily WesterfieldWesterfield says, “I noticed that as soon as I had the first one, I wanted to do this again. It was almost just like, ‘Now who else can I help?’”She delivered healthy babies in 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2021 and 2022. She is currently pregnant and due in July.“I’ve been able to completely just have wonderful pregnancies,” she says. Even so, at age 37, she knows that she may have a limited window in which to continue.In December 2022, Westerfield was on her way to her son’s basketball game when she had to head to the hospital to give birth for the 10th time.Courtesy Emily WesterfieldThe process of being a gestational carrier is markedly different than being pregnant with your own child, according to Westerfield. For instance, there are screenings and contracts and psychological evaluations. Her husband did not accompany her to appointments. She keeps in mind that the end goal is to deliver a healthy child so that another couple can “start, build or complete their family.”Wondering if it’s ever hard to let go of a baby you have physically carried for nine months? Westerfield says it’s not.“I get attached like a loving aunt,” she explains. Knowing the heartbreak that the couple has gone through in the past, “you  want  to hand that baby over when you get to the end of this.”Westerfield started her own surrogacy agency in August 2023 in part to help educate and provide resources for both potential surrogates and intended families.“I feel like there’s so much information out there that it’s overwhelming,” Westerfield says. “And a lot of it is outdated or incorrect, and I want to be able to speak from personal experience going through this process.”She also helps match families with gestational carriers and helps hold their hand through a stressful process, making sure they are on the same page for important topics like physical or chromosomal abnormalities, geographic location, contact preferences after birth and even vaccination status.It’s difficult to find gestational carriers who are willing and fit all of the qualifications. Westerfield also thinks it’s essential for gestational carriers to have completed their own families before helping others grow theirs. She has about six prospective couples for every one potential surrogate.Westerfield takes a lot of pride in helping families grow, especially those she has carried children for. She stays in touch with each family in some capacity via text or social media, and she tries to remember to send birthday gifts.Westerfield gave birth to a baby girl for this mother in 2018. And then she carried twin boys for the same family the next year.Courtesy Emily Westerfield“I am so proud to be able to do this for other people. I know my time is very limited as we’re getting closer and closer to how many people I’m able to help, but still I’m young enough and I’m healthy enough to be able to do so,” Westerfield says. “And I’ll continue to help as long as my body and my family allows me to.”",2024-04-25 12:39:00 PM EEST,NBC,Surrogacy 'unicorn' is pregnant with baby No. 11 and would do it again 'in a heartbeat',https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/surrogacy-unicorn-pregnant-baby-no-11-heartbeat-rcna149290
CNBC,"U.S. prosecutors are seeking an above-guidance sentence of 36 months for the former CEO of  cryptocurrency exchange Binance  on charges of enabling money laundering, according to a sentencing memorandum out late Tuesday.The memorandum, which was filed with the court for the western district of Washington, states that Zhao should serve a higher sentence that suggested under advisory guidelines to “reflect the gravity of his crimes.”Under advisory guidelines, Zhao’s sentencing would come in at a range of 12 to 18 months in prison.“A custodial sentence of 36 months—twice the high end of the Guidelines range—would reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for law, afford adequate deterrence, and be sufficient but not greater than necessary to achieve the goals of sentencing,” U.S. prosecutors said.Zhao is accused of wilfully failing to implement an effective anti-money laundering program as required by the Bank Secrecy Act, and of effectively allowing Binance to process transactions involving proceeds of unlawful activity, including transactions between Americans and individuals in sanctions jurisdictions.Binance has separately been sued by the U.S.  Securities and Exchange Commission  and the  Commodity Futures Trading Commission  over the alleged mishandling of customer assets and the operation of an illegal, unregistered exchange in the U.S.The U.S., which separately accuses Binance and Zhao of violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and sanctions on Iran, ordered Binance to pay $4.3 billion in fines and forfeiture. Zhao agreed to pay a $50 million fine.Zhao stepped down as Binance’s CEO in November last year after reaching this plea and was replaced by the former Abu Dhabi markets regulator’s chief, Richard Teng.Zhao was not immediately available for comment when contacted via social media platform X. Binance has yet to return a request for comment when contacted by CNBC.<h2>‘Unprecedented scale’ of financial crime</h2>Prosecutors say that Zhao violated U.S. law on an “unprecedented scale,” and that he had a “deliberate disregard” for Binance’s legal responsibilities.In the memorandum of Tuesday, prosecutors said that, under Zhao’s control, Binance operated on a “Wild West” model.“Zhao bet that he would not get caught, and that if he did, the consequences would not be as serious as the crime,” the memorandum stated.“But Zhao was caught, and now the Court will decide what price Zhao should pay for his crimes.”Zhao’s official sentencing is expected Tuesday.",2024-04-24 13:13:00 PM EEST,NBC,U.S. prosecutors seek 36-month sentence for ex-Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/us-prosecutors-seek-36-month-sentence-ex-binance-ceo-changpeng-zhao-rcna149115
"Scott Wong,Peter Nicholas,Stephanie Gosk","After a meeting with Columbia University President Minouche Shafik, House Speaker Mike Johnson called on her to resign Wednesday if she can’t tamp down  Gaza war protests  at the school and threatened federal funding for colleges that don't create safe environments for their Jewish students.“We just can’t allow this kind of hatred and antisemitism to flourish on our campuses. And it must be stopped in its tracks. Those who are perpetrating this violence should be arrested,” Johnson, R-La., said on the steps of Columbia’s Low Library, flanked by several of his Republican colleagues.“I am here today joining my colleagues and calling on President Shafik to resign if she cannot immediately bring order to this chaos,"" he continued. ""As speaker of the House, I’m committing today that the Congress will not be silent as Jewish students are expected to run for their lives and stay home from their classes hiding in fear.”Johnson's appearance was met by boos and heckling from the crowd. After he ended his news conference, someone yelled: ""Get the f--- out of here!""The protesters chanted “We can’t hear you"" and “Mike, you suck!”Students also chanted “Free Palestine.” From where Johnson stood, he could look out beyond the crowd of student protesters and see the tent encampment.At one point Johnson shook his head and said, “Enjoy your free speech.”Johnson’s delegation met with Shafik and top university officials, urging them to do more to stop the harassment of Jewish students at Columbia and to end the pro-Palestinian encampment that has sprung up on the campus. Other college campuses around the country have been the scenes of similar demonstrations against Israel’s war in Gaza.Johnson said in an interview after his speech that he respects the right to protest but that he thought the students on campus had crossed into harassment.""It’s always nuanced to control to allow students a free marketplace of ideas and allow that to be unimpeded, and that is the role and responsibility of a government institution and even a private one,"" said Johnson, a former constitutional lawyer.   ""But in this case, the reason we’re here today is because this has crossed the line. And I think almost every American of good conscience and good faith understands that.""Responding to GOP calls for Shafik's resignation, the Columbia University Board of Trustees said in a statement Wednesday it ""strongly supports President Shafik as she steers the university through this extraordinarily challenging time.""""During the search process for this role, President Shafik told us that she would always take a thoughtful approach to resolving conflict, balancing the disparate voices that make up a vibrant campus like Columbia’s, while taking a firm stance against hatred, harassment and discrimination. That’s exactly what she’s doing now,"" the board said. ""We are urgently working with her to help resolve the situation on campus and rebuild the bonds of our community; we encourage everyone who cares about Columbia to join us in that effort.”A rabbi connected with Columbia urged Jewish students this week to leave campus amid the protests, and the university soon thereafter said it was  moving to hybrid learning  to ensure student safety. Students have described being harassed and heckled as they tried to move across campus.Asked by a reporter whether he agrees with some Republicans who have called on the National Guard to break up the Columbia encampment, Johnson said he plans to call President Joe Biden after his visit and “share with him what we have seen with our own two eyes and demand that he take action.”“If this is not contained quickly, and if these threats and intimidation are not stopped, there is an appropriate time for the National Guard. We have to bring order to these campuses,” he said.He then issued this threat to colleges: “If these campuses cannot get control of this problem, they do not deserve taxpayer dollars,” adding that House Republicans will be working on legislation to address the situation.Shafik testified last week before the House Education Committee about antisemitism on campus. On Wednesday, the committee's chair, Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., also threatened Shafik with congressional action.""I have a message, President Shafik, and a message for you all, too: The inmates are running the asylum. Take back control of this once great institution,"" Foxx said at Columbia. ""You took action last week. It’s time to act again. If not, the committee will pursue every possible avenue to create a safe learning environment for Jewish students.""Members of the New York Republican delegation — Reps. Mike Lawler, Nicole Malliotakis and Anthony D'Esposito — also joined Johnson at Columbia. Lawler said Shafik must resign.""It is time for President Shafik to resign in disgrace. She has lost control of this campus. She has lost control of this institution. And after listening to her comments inside it is clear that she has no intention of getting this university under control and ensuring the safety and well-being of every student,"" Lawler told reporters.""That is what is entitled to students attending this institution,"" he said. ""If the students are not safe, if the institution will not act, Congress has a responsibility to do so, and we will.""Wrapping up his news conference, Johnson, a father of four children, offered a message for the students in the encampment.""Go back to class and stop the nonsense there. Look, if we want to have a debate on campus about the merits of these things, let’s do that. But you can’t intimidate your fellow students and make them stay home from class. Think about that. Is that right? Do you think that’s right?"" he asked.""Stop wasting your parents' money,"" he said.",2024-04-25 00:44:00 AM EEST,NBC,Speaker Johnson calls on Columbia University president to resign and threatens federal funding for colleges,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/speaker-johnson-calls-columbia-university-president-resign-threatens-f-rcna149249
"Rob Wile,Scott Wong","TikTok’s fate in the U.S. has never been more in doubt after Congress approved a bill   that gives its parent company two options: sell it to an approved buyer or see it banned.President Joe Biden signed the legislation into law on Wednesday. But it could take years for the TikTok ban to actually go into effect, since its Chinese-owned parent company, ByteDance, is likely to challenge the statute in court. And even if it survives a legal challenge, no one is quite sure what would happen next. How soon could a potential ban take effect?It would probably be several years from now.According to the statute’s language, ByteDance would have nine months to divest and find an American buyer for TikTok once the bill is signed into law. On top of that, the president can push back the deadline by an additional 90 days. That means, without a sale, the soonest TikTok could shut down in the U.S. would be more than one year from now.  But it’s more complicated than that. If ByteDance sues to block the implementation of the statute — which it has said it would do — the bill will be taken up by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, according to Isaac Boltansky, director of policy for the financial services firm BTIG.Boltansky said ByteDance would file a suit no later than this fall. And while the case is under judicial review, the “clock” on any ban is effectively paused, he said. Once the D.C. court issues its ruling, whichever side loses is likely to request a review by the U.S. Supreme Court.That would forestall the ban by another year — meaning nothing would go into effect until 2026, Boltansky said.TikTok will argue that the ban is unconstitutional and that it’s also taken steps to protect American users’ data. The app has already launched an aggressive lobbying campaign, featuring a number of small-business owners and influencers who say it's their lifeblood.“We have got to make enough noise so that they don’t take away our voice,” TikTok user @dadlifejason, who has 13.8 million followers, says in a  TikTok ad  shared on social media.What about finding a buyer?The bill stipulates that TikTok can continue to operate in the U.S. if ByteDance sells the app to a U.S.-approved firm. While large U.S. tech companies would love to get their hands on the platform, Boltansky said that Biden administration regulators — not to mention GOP critics of Big Tech firms — have no interest in expanding the power, reach or influence of such companies.  Some other outside groups might emerge. At least one led by Steve Mnuchin, who was Treasury secretary in the Trump administration,  has already sought to make a bid,  telling CNBC in March that he was putting together an investor group . The Wall Street Journal has also  reported  that former Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick was looking for potential buyer partners. While ByteDance, which owns other companies, is worth hundreds of billions of dollars, TikTok would fetch less than that, experts say — especially if it is sold without its powerful recommendation algorithm.  But Boltansky believes ByteDance is unlikely to agree to any kind of sale. The Chinese government has said as much, arguing that it regards the algorithm as a national security asset. And without that, TikTok becomes much less appealing to potential buyers.    So is TikTok in the U.S. going away?It might — but the ultimate impact may be limited. The fact is, most TikTok users already have a presence on other platforms, so the  impact on their livelihoods to the extent that they operate businesses on TikTok could be limited.According to a survey from the financial services group Wedbush, approximately 60% of TikTok user respondents said they’d simply migrate to Instagram (or Facebook) in the event of a sale, while 19% said they’d go to YouTube. Analysts with financial services company Bernstein arrived at similar estimates. In a note to clients, they forecast that Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, would take over as much as 60% of TikTok’s U.S. ad revenue, with YouTube gaining 25%. Snapchat would also benefit, they said. Why did lawmakers feel they needed to take this drastic step?Boltansky said many political pundits remain surprised that the bill got over the finish line. But a wave of anxiety about both Chinese influence and the impact of social media on youth converged to get it passed.“This has been noteworthy,” Boltansky said. “Everyone is so conditioned to D.C. doing nothing or the bare minimum to keep the lights on.”As tensions with Beijing have grown, congressional lawmakers, along with top law enforcement officials, have warned that TikTok is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and is a national security threat to the United States.“It screams out with national security concerns,” FBI Director Christopher Wray testified on Capitol Hill last yearU.S. officials fear that the Chinese government is using TikTok to access data from, and spy on, its American users, spreading disinformation and conspiracy theories.It felt like a TikTok ban was moving slowly, then quickly. What happened?The House  passed its standalone TikTok bill  on a big bipartisan vote in March. But the Senate appeared in no hurry to take up the measure as Commerce Chair Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., drafted her own legislation.That all changed when Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., working with the White House, rolled out his $95 billion foreign aid supplemental plan last week that included billions of dollars for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. Included in that sweeping aid package: the House’s TikTok bill, with some minor changes. Johnson pushed the package through his chamber, then sent the House on a recess, forcing the Senate to take it or leave it.Rather than further delay the critical, long-stalled military and humanitarian aid, the Democratic-controlled Senate is moving to quickly pass the package — including the TikTok bill and other Johnson priorities.

"Jennifer Liu, CNBC","Millions more Americans could become eligible for overtime pay.The Biden-Harris administration  announced a final rule Tuesday  that raises the minimum salary threshold to qualify for time-and-a-half pay after 40 hours of work in a week.Proponents say the new limit will mean lower-paid workers are fairly compensated for long hours, and business groups are expected to legally challenge it.Here’s what to know:<h2>The new salary limits</h2>Starting July 1, 2024, people earning less than $43,888 per year, or $844 per week, would be eligible for overtime pay.By Jan. 1, 2025, that salary threshold would increase to $58,656 per year, or $1,128 per week.The rule also includes automatic increases to that salary eligibility level every three years, starting in 2027, to keep pace with the changing labor market and wages.The current salary threshold to qualify for overtime pay is $35,568 per year based on a limit set by the Trump administration in 2019 — the first increase since 2004.<h2>More money or time back to workers</h2>Proponents say the new rule will ensure people, particularly in lower-paid roles, get paid for their time if they work longer than a traditional workweek.“Too often, lower-paid salaried workers are doing the same job as their hourly counterparts but are spending more time away from their families for no additional pay,” Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su said in a press release.It could also cause businesses to adjust their procedures so people work fewer overtime hours, giving employees more time back.<h2>Who’s affected</h2>Overtime pay protections in the Fair Labor Standards Act say almost all hourly workers qualify for 1.5 times their pay after 40 hours worked in a week. The new Labor Department rule applies to salaried workers under a certain salary level.The overtime boost is expected to affect  4.3 million workers , 56% of whom are women and 24% of whom are workers of color, according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.Most workers affected are employed in professional and business services, health care and social services, and financial activities.Roughly 15%  of salaried workers are currently entitled to overtime pay, and that will roughly double under the new salary limits. However, it’s far lower than the 60% of salaried workers who were entitled to overtime pay in the 1970s, per the EPI.Since then, the threshold has not kept pace with wage growth, experts say.<h2>More worker protections on the way</h2>Separately, the Federal Trade Commission  issued a final rule  Tuesday  banning noncompete clauses , which proponents say will promote job-switching, higher wages, new businesses and innovation.A noncompete agreement is a contract where an employee agrees to not join or launch a competitor after leaving a company. The FTC estimates 30 million, or 18%, of U.S. workers are currently subject to a noncompete.The agency estimates the change will increase the average worker’s earnings by $524 per year, lower health-care costs by up to $194 billion over the next decade and lead to a 2.7% bump in startups, or roughly 8,500 new businesses per year.The rule will become effective 120 days after being published in the Federal Register, though business groups are expected to challenge it.",2024-04-25 00:45:00 AM EEST,NBC,Workers earning up to $58K a year could soon become eligible for overtime pay,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/workers-earning-58k-year-soon-become-eligible-overtime-pay-rcna149262
Lawrence Hurley,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court appeared divided Wednesday as it grappled with whether provisions of Idaho's near-total abortion ban unlawfully conflict with a federal law aimed at ensuring certain standards for emergency medical care for patients, including pregnant women.Some conservative justices, who have a 6-3 majority, appeared skeptical about the Biden administration’s lawsuit arguing that the state ban restricts potentially lifesaving treatment for women suffering complications during pregnancy. Liberal members of the court appeared to back the administration's position.The justices are weighing an appeal brought by Idaho officials who are contesting a lawsuit the Biden administration filed over abortion access in emergency situations.The state abortion law was enacted in 2020, with a provision stating it would go into effect if the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that found women had a constitutional right to abortion.The 2020 law, called the Defense of Life Act,  went into effect  in 2022 when the Supreme Court  rolled back  Roe. The state law says anyone who performs an abortion is subject to criminal penalties, including up to five years in prison. Health care professionals found to have violated the law can lose their professional licenses.The federal government sued, leading a federal judge in August 2022 to block the state from enforcing provisions concerning medical care that is required under the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or EMTALA.The federal law, enacted in 1986, requires that patients receive appropriate emergency room care. The Biden administration argues that care should include abortions in certain situations. The law applies to any hospital that receives federal funding under the Medicare program.There is an exception to the Idaho law if an abortion is necessary to protect the life of the pregnant woman, although the scope of the exception came under close scrutiny during the oral argument.Idaho’s lawyer, Joshua Turner, faced tough questioning about whether the exception can also apply to a situation in which a woman has complications that pose a substantial health risk but not imminent death.Liberal Justice Elena Kagan said federal law says “that you don’t have to wait until the person is on the verge of death.” “If the woman is going to lose her reproductive organs, that’s enough to trigger this duty on the part of the hospital to stabilize the patient,” she said. Fellow liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked similar questions, providing several examples of real-life situations in which women have faced emergency situations when doctors had to make calls about whether to authorize abortions, including a situation in which a patient at 16 weeks of pregnancy whose water broke was at risk of sepsis or a hemorrhage after she was refused an abortion in Florida.""Is that a case in which Idaho the day before would have said it's OK to have an abortion?"" Sotomayor asked.Turner argued that such medical decisions are “subjective” and that a doctor’s judgment in such instances would be based on good faith, not an objective standard. Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh, both conservatives, indicated they saw Idaho’s law as allowing for treatment similar to what the Biden administration says the federal law requires, suggesting that there may not be any conflict.At one point Barrett said she was ""shocked"" at Turner's answers to questions about what kind of treatment was allowed, because ""I thought your own expert had said below that these kinds of cases were covered.""Kavanaugh likewise questioned the daylight between the two laws, wondering what the implications are if ""Idaho law allows an abortion in each of the emergency circumstances that is identified by the government.""""What does that mean for what we're deciding here?"" he asked Turner.Conservative Justice Samuel Alito seemed most skeptical of the federal government's argument, at one point mentioning language in the federal law referring to treatment for an ""unborn child,"" a term more commonly used by anti-abortion advocates.""Isn't that an odd phrase to put in a statute that imposes a mandate to perform abortions?"" Alito asked Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar.""Have you seen abortion statutes that use the phrase 'unborn child'? Doesn't that tell us something?""Prelogar responded that the phrase did not displace the requirement that women get the treatment they need in emergency situations.Conservative justices, including Neil Gorsuch, also questioned whether the federal government even has the power to mandate health standards when they are tied to Medicare funding.In January, the Supreme Court  allowed  Idaho to enforce the provisions while also agreeing to hear oral arguments in the case. Other provisions of the ban are already in effect and will not be affected by how the justices rule.The decision will affect not just Idaho but also other states, including Texas, that have enacted similar abortion bans that abortion-rights advocates say clash with the federal law.In blocking parts of the state law that conflict with federal law, U.S. District Court Judge B. Lynn Winmill described the state’s actions as putting doctors in a difficult situation.“The doctor believes her EMTALA obligations require her to offer that abortion right now. But she also knows that all abortions are banned in Idaho. She thus finds herself on the horns of a dilemma. Which law should she violate?” he wrote.The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals briefly put Winmill’s ruling on hold in September, but it subsequently allowed it to go back into effect, prompting the state officials to turn to the Supreme Court.Prelogar wrote in court papers that EMTALA requires ""necessary stabilizing treatment,"" which in cases involving pregnant women in emergency situations may require abortions.""And in those limited but critically important circumstances EMTALA requires the hospital to offer that care,"" she added.The state argues that it was only after Roe was overturned that the Biden administration said EMTALA could be interpreted to require abortions in some contexts, calling it a ""nationwide abortion mandate.""EMTALA ""merely prohibits emergency rooms from turning away indigent patients with serious medical conditions,"" Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador wrote in court papers. The law was not intended to override state laws regulating health care, he added.The Idaho dispute is one of two abortion cases now pending at the Supreme Court, both of which arose in the aftermath of the 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. In the other case, the court is considering  a challenge  that could restrict access to mifepristone, the drug most commonly used for medication abortions.",2024-04-24 13:59:00 PM EEST,NBC,Supreme Court wrestles with abortion clash over emergency room treatment for pregnant women,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-hears-abortion-clash-emergency-room-treatment-pregnant-w-rcna148863
J.J. McCorvey,"The United Auto Workers just  notched a historic victory in Tennessee , the union’s first major win since signing new contracts in Detroit as it shifts focus to the South. Some industry workers there feel more optimistic than ever, but others still aren’t ready to join up.Friday’s landslide outcome at the Chattanooga Volkswagen plant, where 73% of workers who cast votes opted to unionize, followed two failed attempts and is the UAW’s first win at a foreign automaker in the South.The breakthrough came months after strikes at the Big Three Detroit automakers — Ford, General Motors and Jeep maker Stellantis, all of which have long been unionized. Those walkouts led to contracts, ratified by  64% of voting union members , featuring pay hikes and better job security in an increasingly electrified auto industry.The UAW is now targeting 13 nonunion automakers, with the next battle set for a Mercedes-Benz plant in Vance, Alabama, that will vote on unionizing in mid-May.“We’ve got the lead,” said Jeremy Kimbrell, a measurement machine operator at the plant who isn’t daunted by a climate  some expect  to be tougher for labor organizers than Tennessee’s.All Southern states have “right to work” laws  allowing workers to opt out of union participation, contributing to membership rates that  lag behind the national 10% average . While Volkswagen remained neutral in the Chattanooga campaign,  six Southern GOP governors, including Alabama’s, slammed it , warning of potential layoffs to offset higher labor costs.Kimbrell said he and some of his colleagues have been required to watch videos outlining the potential downsides to union membership, adding that management has sought to limit group discussion of the issues.Employees at the Vance plant  filed federal charges  against Mercedes, alleging it retaliated against pro-union workers by denying some paid family leave and taking disciplinary action for minor infractions. In February, the Department of Labor  recovered nearly $440,000  in back wages and unpaid bonuses for two plant workers who were terminated after taking federally covered leave.A Mercedes spokesperson said the company “holds meetings where multiple business topics are covered” and would “continue to share facts and opinions through open and direct communication” so staffers could make an informed choice. The company has said it cooperated with regulators but  denied violating federal rules  or wrongfully terminating workers.Kimbrell, who has worked at the Alabama facility for over 20 years and volunteers on the organizing committee, said he’d long doubted that unionizing was “ever gonna happen.” Now he’d be surprised if it didn’t: “There’s no doubt that people on the floor think we’re going to win.”Some labor experts also foresee the momentum continuing.“We’re going to see a huge change in the balance of power in the South once you have powerful unions who can leverage change in public policy in those states,” said Kate Bronfenbrenner, director of labor education research at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations. “The gains that happened in 2023 moved people into middle class jobs,” she said, and workers everywhere see it.But not all of them have been won over.Omari Roundtree, who works as a trim specialist at a Honda plant in Maryville, Ohio — and has a brother who works at the Chattanooga VW plant —   said his skepticism since  speaking to NBC News in October  hasn’t shifted much. He still hasn’t seen enough of the benefits of unionizing to overcome his mistrust of the UAW, stemming from his father’s experience working for a GM supplier in the 1990s.“Maybe if there was an offshoot or another [union] that was created,” said Roundtree, 33, “but I don’t necessarily trust the characters and actors from that organization.”The UAW’s president, Shawn Fain, has sought to refresh its image after sweeping into power on an anti-establishment platform following a high-level corruption scandal. Some supporters said they see the UAW’s push beyond Detroit as Fain making good on his campaign promises.In a  news conference  Tuesday, Fain appealed to members who question the UAW’s Southern strategy and the use of their dues to support it, saying, “This ain’t charity, this is power.”Fain also touted the “UAW bump” — pay raises at nonunion firms after the Big Three strikes — and described nationwide membership growth as an important tool to maximize the union’s clout.“In 2028, we’re going back to the table with Ford, GM and Stellantis,” he said. “If we want the leverage to win back our pensions and retirement health care, we need to organize the unorganized.”James Bryant, a 52-year-old vehicle inspector at a Nissan plant in Canton, Mississippi, said the automaker rolled out “the biggest raise that they’ve ever given us” after the UAW finalized its Big Three contracts last fall, boosting his hourly pay to $34.62 from $31.47.Bryant said he was heartened by the Volkswagen vote and believes it will help energize skittish co-workers at the Canton plant, which voted down a 2017 union bid  after a heated campaign  that drew national attention.“We are still going to be so far behind everybody else” due to the  annual wage progression  the UAW negotiated with the Big Three, he said. “If Mercedes passes their union vote, Nissan might as well not even put up a fight.”A Nissan spokesperson said the company respects workers’ right to organize but said, “For more than forty years, when Nissan employees have exercised their voices, they have chosen overwhelmingly to continue representing themselves.”Some Southern autoworkers said they’re already seeing stronger union interest this year.In February, the UAW said more than 30% of workers at Hyundai’s auto plant in Montgomery signed union cards. Conbralius Thomas, 37, who works on a multifunctional team there, said he and other volunteers are working with the union to reach 50%. Once 70% of eligible site workers sign cards, the UAW will ask the company to recognize the union or call for a federally overseen vote if it doesn’t.Hyundai said “the decision to be represented by a union is up to our team members” and pointed to a new pay structure it said would boost hourly wages by 25% by 2028.For now, Thomas is pleased with the UAW’s efforts. “They’re sticking their necks out and it’s showing,” he said.",2024-04-24 22:43:00 PM EEST,NBC,"UAW's Tennessee win fuels backers' hopes in the South, but some skeptics are unmoved",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/autos/uaws-tennessee-win-fuels-hopes-south-skeptics-remain-rcna149013
"Jeff Cox, CNBC","With the economy humming along and the stock market, despite some recent twists and turns, hanging in there pretty well, it’s a tough case to sell that higher interest rates are having a substantially negative impact on the economy.So what if policymakers just decide to keep rates where they are for even longer, and go through all of 2024 without cutting?It’s a question that, despite the current conditions, makes Wall Street shudder and Main Street queasy as well.“When rates start climbing higher, there has to be an adjustment,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial. “The calculus has changed. So the question is, are we going to have issues if rates remain higher for longer?”The higher-for-longer stance was not what investors were expecting at the beginning of 2024, but it’s what they have to deal with now as inflation  has proven stickier  than expected, hovering around 3% compared with the Federal Reserve’s 2% target.Recent statements by Fed Chair  Jerome Powell  and other policymakers have cemented the notion that  rate cuts aren’t coming  in the next several months. In fact, there even has been talk about the potential for  an additional hike or two  ahead if inflation doesn’t ease further.That leaves big questions over when exactly monetary policy easing will come, and what the central bank’s position to remain on hold will do to both financial markets and the broader economy.Krosby said some of those answers will come soon as the current earnings season heats up. Corporate officers will provide key details beyond sales and profits, including the impact that interest rates are having on profit margins and consumer behavior.“If there’s any sense that companies have to start cutting back costs and that leads to labor market trouble, this is the path of a potential problem with rates this high,” Krosby said.But financial markets, despite a recent 5.5% sell-off for the S&P 500,  have largely held up  amid the higher-rate landscape. The broad market, large-cap index is still up 6.3% year to date in the face of a Fed on hold, and 23% above the late October 2023 low.<h2>Higher rates can be a good sign</h2>History tells differing stories about the consequences of a hawkish Fed, both for markets and the economy.Higher rates are generally a good thing so long as they’re associated with growth. The last period when that wasn’t true was when then-Fed Chair Paul Volcker strangled inflation with aggressive hikes that ultimately and purposely tipped the economy into recession.There is little precedent for the Fed to cut rates in robust growth periods such as the present, with gross domestic product expected to accelerate at a 2.4% annualized pace in the first quarter of 2024, which would mark the seventh consecutive quarter of growth better than 2%. Preliminary first-quarter GDP numbers are due to be reported Thursday.For the past several decades, higher rates have not been linked to recessions.On the contrary, Fed chairs have often been faulted for keeping rates too low for too long, leading to the dot-com bubble and subprime market implosions that triggered two of the three recessions this century. In the other one, the Fed’s benchmark funds rate was at just 1% when the Covid-induced downturn occurred.In fact, there are arguments that too much is made of Fed policy and its broader impact on the $27.4 trillion U.S. economy.“I don’t think that active monetary policy really moves the economy nearly as much as the Federal Reserve thinks it does,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.Kelly points out that the Fed, in the 11-year run between the financial crisis and the Covid pandemic, tried to bring inflation up to 2% using monetary policy and mostly failed. Over the past year, the pullback in the inflation rate has coincided with tighter monetary policy, but Kelly doubts the Fed had much to do with it.Other economists have made a similar case, namely that the main issue that monetary policy influences — demand — has remained robust, while the supply issue that largely operates outside the reach of interest rates has been the principle driver behind decelerating inflation.Where rates do matter, Kelly said, is in financial markets, which in turn can affect economic conditions.“Rates too high or too low distort financial markets. That ultimately undermines the productive capacity of the economy in the long run and can lead to bubbles, which destabilizes the economy,” he said.“It’s not that I think they’ve set rates at the wrong level for the economy,” he added. “I do think the rates are too high for financial markets, and they ought to try to get back to normal levels — not low levels, normal levels — and keep them there.”<h2>Higher-for-longer the likely path</h2>As a matter of policy, Kelly said that would translate into three quarter-percentage point rate cuts this year and next, taking the fed funds rate down to a range of 3.75%-4%. That’s about in line with the 3.9% rate at the end of 2025 that Federal Open Market Committee members penciled in last month as part of their “dot-plot” projections.Futures market pricing implies a fed funds rate of 4.32% by December 2025, indicating a higher rate trajectory.While Kelly is advocating for “a gradual normalization of policy,” he does think the economy and markets can withstand a permanently higher level of rates.In fact, he expects the Fed’s current projection of a “neutral” rate at 2.6% is unrealistic, an idea that is gaining traction on Wall Street. Goldman Sachs, for instance, recently has opined that the neutral rate — neither stimulative nor restrictive — could be as high as 3.5%. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester also recently said it’s possible that  the long-run neutral rate  is higher.That leaves expectations for Fed policy tilting toward cutting rates somewhat but not going back to the near-zero rates that prevailed in the years after the financial crisis.In fact, over the long run, the fed funds rate going back to 1954 has averaged 4.6%, even given the extended seven-year run of near-zero rates after the  2008 crisis  until 2015.<h2>Government spending issues</h2>One thing that has changed dramatically, though, over the decades has been the state of public finances.The $34.6 trillion national debt has exploded since Covid hit in March 2020, rising by nearly 50%. The federal government is on track to run a $2 trillion budget deficit in fiscal 2024, with net interest payments thanks to those higher interest rates on pace to surpass $800 billion.The deficit as a share of GDP in 2023 was 6.2%; by comparison, the European Union allows its members only 3%.The fiscal largesse has juiced the economy enough to make the Fed’s higher rates less noticeable, a condition that could change in the days ahead if benchmark rates hold high, said Troy Ludtka, senior U.S. economist at SMBC Nikko Securities America.“One of the reasons why we haven’t noticed this monetary tightening is simply a reflection of the fact that the U.S. government is running its most irresponsible fiscal policy in a generation,” Ludtka said. “We’re running massive deficits into a full-employment economy, and that’s really keeping things afloat.”However, the higher rates have begun to take their toll on consumers, even if sales remain solid.Credit card delinquency rates climbed to 3.1% at the end of 2023, the highest level in 12 years, according to Fed data. Ludtka said the higher rates are likely to result in a “retrenchment” for consumers and ultimately a “cliff effect” where the Fed ultimately will have to concede and lower rates.“So, I don’t think they should be cutting anytime in the immediate future. But at some point that’s going to have to happen, because these interest rates are simply crushing particularly low-income-earning Americans,” he said. “That is a big portion of the population.”",2024-04-25 01:12:00 AM EEST,NBC,Why the Fed's keeping rates higher for longer may not be such a bad thing,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/fed-keeping-rates-higher-longer-may-not-bad-thing-rcna149264
"Jay Blackman,Phil Helsel","A federal rule announced Wednesday will require airlines to quickly give cash refunds — without lengthy arguments — to passengers whose flights have been canceled or seriously delayed, the Biden administration said.“Passengers deserve to get their money back when an airline owes them — without headaches or haggling,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement.The rule from the Transportation Department says passengers who decline other reimbursement like travel credits are to get cash refunds.It applies when a flight is canceled or has a “significant change,” the administration said.A “significant change” includes when departure or arrival times are three or more hours different from the scheduled times for domestic flights or six hours for international flights, and when the airport is changed or connections are added, it said.Passengers are also to get refunds when their baggage is 12 hours late in delivery for domestic flights.The new rule comes after promises to hold airlines accountable after major disruptions that made travel hell for passengers, including the  2022 Southwest Airlines meltdown , which resulted in  almost 17,000  significantly delayed or canceled flights and a missing baggage nightmare.The Transportation Department said that the new rule means refunds are automatic and that ""airlines must automatically issue refunds without passengers having to explicitly request them or jump through hoops.""Also announced Wednesday was a rule requiring airlines to more clearly disclose so-called junk fees upfront, such as surprise baggage or other fees, the department said.It said that rule is expected to save fliers around $500 million a year.The surprise fees are used so tickets look cheaper than they really are, and then fliers get the unwelcome surprise of fees on checked bags, carry-on bags or reservation changes — or even discounts that are advertised but apply to only part of the ticket price, officials said.Airlines will also have to tell fliers clearly that their seats are guaranteed and that they don't have to pay extra to ensure they have seats for flights, according to the Transportation Department.Airlines for America, an industry trade group, said that its member airlines “offer transparency and vast choice to consumers from first search to touchdown” and that they do offer cash refunds.The 11 largest U.S. airlines returned $10.9 billion in cash refunds last year, an increase over $7.5 billion in 2019 but slightly down from $11.2 billion in 2022, the group said.“U.S. airlines are providing more options and better services while ticket prices, including ancillary revenues, are at historic lows,” Airlines for America said.Left out of the federal changes announced Wednesday are those involving ""family seating fees,"" but the Transportation Department said in a statement that ""DOT is planning to propose a separate rule that bans airlines from charging these junk fees.""Travelers have complained to the Transportation Department  that children weren’t seated next to accompanying adults, including in some cases young children, department officials said last year.Fees on bags specifically have made up an increasing amount of airline revenues, the Transportation Department said Wednesday in announcing the new rules.A Transportation Department analysis found that airline revenue from baggage fees increased 30% from 2018 to 2022, while operating revenue — which is from the flights themselves — increased by only half that amount, the department said.",2024-04-24 13:00:00 PM EEST,NBC,Airlines must cough up cancellation cash and can no longer hide fees under new federal rule,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/new-federal-rule-guarantee-hassle-free-airline-cash-refunds-administra-rcna149087
"Berkeley Lovelace Jr.,Erin McLaughlin,Jason Kane","Dale Folwell says North Carolina is “under siege” by drugmakers Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly.The North Carolina treasurer said the  sky-high costs of popular weight loss drugs  —  Wegovy  and Saxenda, from Novo Nordisk, and  Zepbound , from Eli Lilly — have financially strained the state’s health insurance plan for its roughly 700,000 teachers, state employees and retirees, forcing it to stop providing coverage for the drugs earlier this year.According to the state treasurer’s office, last year, North Carolina paid for  weight loss drugs  for almost 25,000 state employees, costing it more than $100 million  before rebates  — about 10% of its total spending on prescription drugs and more than the plan spent on all  cancer treatments  combined. The weight loss drugs were projected to cost North Carolina another $600 million-plus within the next five years. That ballooning expense prompted the state’s health plan board of trustees in January to vote to stop covering them on the state’s health care plan. That’s not how Folwell wanted it to go.Last fall, in a last-ditch effort to reduce the state’s spending on weight loss drugs, Folwell, working alongside the state’s pharmacy benefit manager CVS Caremark, initiated drug pricing negotiations with Novo Nordisk, later followed by Eli Lilly. The negotiations are ongoing.“I don’t recall of any time since I’ve been the keeper of the public purse in the last eight years where we’ve tried to have direct conversations with the manufacturers of any drugs,” he said. Novo Nordisk  charges a monthly list price  of around $1,350 each for Wegovy and Saxenda, while  Lilly charges about $1,060 a month  for Zepbound. North Carolina gets a rebate from the drugmakers that lowers those prices by a few hundred dollars; even so, the state says the drugs are too expensive for it to afford.“The cost of this drug can be anywhere from  $10 to $70 to manufacture it , and it’s being sold for retail for well over $1,000,” Folwell said. “I don’t know what word in the Webster’s Dictionary would best describe it other than being gouged.”Folwell is also proposing that the state health plan raise the  minimum body mass index, or BMI , threshold to qualify for the drugs, reserving it for people with severe obesity. The Food and Drug Administration  approved the medications  for patients with a BMI of 30 or above, which is characterized as obesity, not severe obesity. He also wants to limit the amount of time people can stay on the drugs if they aren't effective.Ongoing negotiationsFolwell is coming to the negotiating table with one number in mind: $300. That’s around the price, he said, that people pay in Denmark, where Novo Nordisk is based.“When we’re being gouged on the price of this drug versus what it costs in the home country of where this company is headquartered, we have to take action,” he said.In separate statements, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly said that they are committed to working on potential solutions to provide coverage to North Carolina patients. But Nicole Ferreira, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson, said in the company’s statement that the state “rejected multiple, workable options presented to them.”“Denying patients insurance coverage for important and effective FDA-approved treatments is simply irresponsible,” she said.If the state had continued to cover the drugs under the current deal,  monthly premiums  for all state employees on the plan would’ve likely doubled, Folwell said. People on the plan typically pay, on average, $37 a month. Ferreira said, “we stand committed to finding meaningful solutions to manage costs.” In a statement, an Eli Lilly spokesperson said, “We remain committed to expanding access and are continuing to explore different approaches with PBMs, health plans, and employers,” referring to  pharmacy benefit managers, which act as a middleman between drugmakers and insurers .“We remain cautiously optimistic that ongoing negotiations with CVS Caremark and the drug manufacturers will result in affordable costs of these medications,” a spokesperson for the state treasurer’s office said.North Carolina isn’t the only state plan that has  covered weight loss drugs  and was forced to make a change.Connecticut recently limited the weight loss drugs to state employees who also agreed to follow lifestyle, diet and exercise changes, a move that Sean Scanlon, the state’s comptroller, said has helped lower costs.Asked about negotiating with the drugmakers, Scanlon said he’s watching what’s happening in other states. “But in my experience, these drugmakers that make this have a lock and are making a ton of money and don’t have too much of an incentive to do that,” he said. “So we’re not sitting around and waiting for large drug companies to start being altruistic.”Patients left behindThe ongoing negotiations are of little comfort to North Carolina state employees who lost coverage for drugs at the beginning of April. Leanne Owens, a primary care provider in Hillsborough, North Carolina, treats patients enrolled in the state’s health plan. In recent weeks, she’s gotten panicked calls from patients on the drugs about what to do next. “My patients had a lot of fear about going off of these medicines, the weight gain, their relationships with food,” she said. One of her patients, Skylar Hackney, a 26-year-old state employee who works for public schools, was prescribed Wegovy a year ago and has since lost 50 pounds. Skylar had prediabetes, and says that her condition could develop into diabetes, allowing her to get access to  semaglutide  again. Semaglutide is the active ingredient in both Wegovy and Novo Nordisk’s diabetes drug Ozempic, which is  often used off-label for weight loss . North Carolina is not cutting off access to diabetes drugs.She took her last shot of Wegovy last Thursday. If she can’t get more, she’ll be forced to quit.“ I really would like to not start over again,” Hackney said. “Just because anything you put in your body new or that you’ve been off for a while, you have some side effects that aren’t great. But I’ve like gotten to a point where I’m at the highest dose on the Wegovy, that I’ve like leveled out. And it’s been wonderful.”",2024-04-25 00:22:00 AM EEST,NBC,How one state is trying to make weight loss drugs cheaper,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/one-state-trying-make-weight-loss-drugs-cheaper-rcna148997
