Nathaniel Meyersohn,"Caitlin Clark, who became the leading scorer in NCAA basketball history and the first pick in the WNBA draft this week, will make a $76,535 salary this year. The top NBA pick will make $10.5 million.Clark’s salary compared to top National Basketball Association players is drawing attention to Women’s National Basketball Association players’ pay and the often massive gender gap in professional sports salaries. The highest-paid WNBA player made a $242,000 salary, while the league minimum salary in the NBA is over a million dollars in 2023.Clark, who dominated at the University of Iowa, as well as other college stars who have turned pro like Louisiana State University’s Angel Reese, lifted women’s college basketball to heights it’s never seen before. Clark helped attract record-breaking TV audiences and sellout crowds in arenas around the country in her final collegiate season.But Clark is not simply the first pick in the draft. She is so popular that a ticket to her Final Four game in the NCAA tournament this year cost more than a ticket for a men’s Final Four game. The 22-year-old is the all-time scoring leader in men’s and women’s NCAA Division I history.The WNBA’s stars aren’t asking to be paid an equal dollar amount to NBA players, however. Not right now, anyway. They acknowledge the reality of being in a league with a smaller pool of revenue to go around, and one that is a lot younger — without 50 preceding years of contract negotiations and the subsequent hard-won worker protections and salaries that come with that longevity.What they want is more an issue of fairness, they say.“W players want to be invested in, properly valued and fairly paid like other professionals,” Terri Jackson, head of the WNBA Players’ Association, the union representing the players, told CNN.Women receive around 10% of the WNBA’s overall revenue, while the NBA collective bargaining agreement gives players 50% of revenue, said David Berri, a professor of economics at Southern Utah University and author of an upcoming book on women and sports.“We are not asking to get paid what the men get paid. We’re asking to get paid the same percentage of revenue shared,” Las Vegas Aces star Kelsey Plum said in an interview in 2022.Even the top athletes in the WNBA sometimes risk danger to play in overseas leagues — where there is no salary cap and players can make up to double or triple their US salary — in the WNBA’s off-season to supplement their income.The star center for the Phoenix Mercury, Brittney Griner, was headed to Russia to play in the WNBA’s offseason in 2022 when she was wrongfully detained in Russia for 10 months. Griner was eventually released as part of a prisoner exchange. (The WNBA says it has been investing to ensure that players stay stateside in the off-season.)<h2>How contracts are set</h2>Rookie salaries and player contracts in both the NBA and WNBA are set by their respective leagues’ collective bargaining agreements with their players’ union. The agreements include an annual salary cap for teams — $136 million in the NBA and $1.5 million for the WNBA. But the NBA has what’s known as a “soft salary cap,” in that there are several exceptions that help players bring in more money. The WNBA, in contrast, has a hard salary cap, meaning there are very few exceptions.A WNBA spokesperson said that Clark stood to make more than $500,000 in total compensation, including cash from player marketing agreements with the league and team deals.But Jackson said that including compensation “blurred the lines” because few players are eligible for those deals.WNBA players have made progress on salaries since 2020, when they reached their latest collective bargaining agreement with the league. But the wide gap is a result of the economic differences between the two leagues; years of underinvestment in the WNBA; and the lack of bargaining power women traditionally have had negotiating salary, benefits and other issues like travel accommodations with the league.“When you talk about pay equity, you are talking about resources, the level of investment, what the strategic plan is, and how intentional it is to grow [the WNBA] in a sustainable way,” Jackson said. “This is a model that has been under-resourced for so long.”The NBA is 50 years older than the WNBA, has more than double the number of teams and games in a season, and brings in $10 billion a year in revenue, compared to a reported $200 million for the WNBA.The WNBA has also been paid less by broadcasters and advertisers in comparison to the NBA. The NBA’s national media deals pay it $2.8 billion, while the WNBA is getting about $65 million this year for its media rights.“It’s not an apples to apples comparison. It comes down to where this league is in its business cycle,” said Alicia Jessop, an associate professor of sport administration at Pepperdine University.<h2>Sharing the revenue pie</h2>Because it’s a smaller and younger league, women’s players have had less bargaining power with team owners over their pay than men.While NBA players receive 50% of total NBA revenue, the WNBA must hit a certain revenue threshold annually before any revenue sharing agreements kick in. This has held back women’s salaries.“That’s a league choice. They don’t have to do it that way,” David Berri said. But the players have been stuck.“They can’t just go off and create a new league with new teams. It takes a long time to develop attachment to professional sports teams.”If the WNBA paid 50% of its revenue to players, top players would earn more than $3 million in salary, he said.<h2>Pivotal moment for the WNBA</h2>The WNBA launched in 1997, spearheaded by longtime former NBA commissioner David Stern, who believed creating a women’s league would grow the game overall.But some critics say the NBA could have done more to benefit the WNBA.“The NBA is bad at negotiating for women. The women end up being throw-ins to their deals,” said Berri.WNBA players want to see more investment from the NBA, broadcasters and corporate partners into the league. The WNBA should not be an afterthought to the men’s league, Jackson added.WNBA player salaries could rise in coming years as interest from fans and advertisers grows. The WNBA is coming off its most-watched regular season in 21 years, and attendance at games last season hit its highest level in 13 years.WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert recently told CNN that next few years of the WNBA will set the league up for the next 30-40 years.The league plans to expand to 16 teams by 2028. It’s negotiating new media rights that are expected to bring in millions of dollars of additional revenue and increased visibility for star players and teams. And the WNBA reportedly hopes to receive up to $100 million a season from broadcast partners in its new deals.The players’ union is expected to opt out of its agreement at the end of the 2025 season. With a new media rights agreement and a new collective bargaining agreement, salaries could go up and benefits expand — as they did after the players opted out of the last agreement in 2018.“If we have games that are doing 18 million viewers, all right, let’s lift things up a little bit more. Salaries will go up, benefits will go up,” Breanna Stewart of the New York Liberty and vice president of the players’ union said in a recent interview.",2024-04-17 18:57:00,What the conversation about Caitlin Clark’s pay gets wrong,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/17/business/caitlin-clark-will-earn-a-usd76-535-salary-this-year-the-lowest-paid-nba-player-makes-usd1-1-million/index.html
Allison Morrow,"Going to college is supposed to be the path to a more prosperous life. But the cost of getting a degree has become a financial albatross, weighing down borrowers from the day they graduate to the day they retire — if retirement is even possible.Student loan debt is a burden that nearly 3 out of 4 American borrowers say has forced them to delay a major life event — whether that’s buying a house, having kids or getting married, according to the latest Gallup Lumina Foundation Cost of College report.“I’ve had to just put all of my dreams aside and focus on surviving day to day,” Jes Evans, 35, told CNN. She earned a master’s in religious studies in 2017, with dreams of teaching at a college. But she couldn’t find any jobs in her field when she graduated and struggled to find jobs in other areas where she lacked experience.Evans, who now works as a director of youth programs and communications at a church north of Pittsburgh, feels trapped by her debt, for which she pays $940 a month.“It just feels like you’re treading water your whole life … I can’t travel, I couldn’t really have a family because I couldn’t afford it. It’s just a slog.”Evans is far from alone.Dozens of people who responded to a CNN prompt on social media this week said their student debt has hammered their credit score and drained their income. Many who responded said they were nearing retirement age but couldn’t imagine being able to stop working, saying they would take their debt to their grave.“Cost is the No. 1 issue when people say they’re not going to pursue postsecondary education,” said Courtney Brown, who has been leading the Gallup Lumina study for the past four years.“When people have this debt, not only are they not having children, they’re not buying homes, they’re also not starting their own businesses,” Brown said in an interview. “And that will be a problem — we need our local businesses, we need innovation, and that’s another thing that’s going to hurt us.”One in 3 students in the United States currently enrolled in college or other post-high-school program say they have considered stopping their coursework over the past six months, the Gallup Lumina poll found. Among those, 31% blame the cost — the third-most cited factor behind emotional stress and personal mental health reasons.“People want to get a degree — it’s not that they don’t value it,” said Brown, the vice president of impact and planning for the Lumina Foundation, a nonprofit that aims to increase participation in education beyond high school. “I think they’re increasingly frustrated, not only because it costs so much but it’s confusing to understand how much it costs.”<h2>The limits of debt relief</h2>Spiraling tuition costs have begun to change the narrative around the value of a college degree. In 2015, more than half — 57% — of Americans had “a great deal” or “quite a lot” of confidence in higher education, according to a separate Gallup study. Last year, that figure hit a new low of 36%. That Gallup study didn’t focus on the cause of the eroding confidence, but it said that rising costs “likely play a significant role.”Part of the problem is the scale of the higher education system in the US, where hundreds of nonprofit colleges are competing for enrollment and talent, and a large proportion of upper- and middle-class parents are willing to pay top dollar — or even go into debt themselves — to give their kids the best education possible.Some critics of the Biden administration’s student loan forgiveness plans say that wiping out the debt doesn’t fix the root cause — and in fact could encourage universities to raise tuition even further.The White House has forgiven a staggering $153 billion in federal student loan debt, giving a financial lifeline to millions of borrowers.When Josh, who lives in Oregon and asked CNN not to publish his last name, received an email from the Department of Education last week, he said his first reaction was, “What the heck do they want now?”But he soon learned there was good news: He’d qualified for loan forgiveness.“To read the words that I now qualified, having reached the number of monthly payments … I was just blown away,” he said. “I can’t begin to describe how it feels to have this glimmer of hope that 24 years of struggle is possibly coming to an end.”Josh says he’s not allowing himself to get his hopes up just yet, noting that there are already two lawsuits challenging Biden’s SAVE plan. But in moments when he lets himself imagine his life without debt, he dreams of finally buying a home with his husband.<h2>The dream of retirement</h2>As striking as Biden’s $153 billion in forgiven debt is, it is less than 10% of the trillion-plus dollars in outstanding federal debt.Since 2007, borrowers who work for the government or a nonprofit have been able to lighten their debt load through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. But not all public sector workers are eligible.Amy Coody, a social worker at a maximum-security women’s prison in Wetumpka, Alabama, says she is ineligible for the PSLF program because she’s employed through a third-party contractor rather than directly by the state.“Even though I’m in the prison and dealing with the inmates, they said that that’s not public service,” she said in an interview. “I’ve been paying on my loans for 21 years, and I’m never going to be able to retire at this rate.”Borrowers who took private loans or moved their debt to private lenders to consolidate it also aren’t eligible for loan forgiveness.That’s an acute frustration for Ralph Davis, a 64-year-old chiropractor from Savannah, Georgia. Davis said he doesn’t begrudge anyone lucky enough to have their debt wiped away. But he can’t help see “sort of an essential unfairness” within the Biden programs.Davis graduated from chiropractic college in 1986, with about $30,000 in debt from federal student loans. At the time, he was advised to consolidate those debts through a private lender. He later amassed $40,000 in debt trying to get an additional degree through a for-profit college, though he eventually gave up on the degree when the college kept changing the curriculum to move the finish line forward.But because Davis consolidated his debt through a private lender, he’s not eligible for federal forgiveness programs.He isn’t bitter about it, and he’s not counting on a magic wand to come and zap his debt away. But he is conscious of being left out, resigned to the reality that it may take nine more years before he can finally pay off his loans.“I did freely enter into these arrangements in order to advance my career — nobody tied my hands and said, ‘sign here,’” he told CNN. “And I have faithfully from the day I graduated my doctoral program in ’86, through the additional education … even during the pandemic.”But over the past four decades “basically, every dime I’ve paid has gone to interest,” Davis said. “And of course, that does tend to put retirement ideas a little bit on hold.”",2024-04-17 08:51:00,Student debt is haunting Americans from graduation to retirement,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/16/economy/student-debt-gallup-poll/index.html
Anna Cooban,"The creation of sexually explicit deepfake content is likely to become a criminal offense in England and Wales as concern grows over the use of artificial intelligence to exploit and harass women.Under a draft law, anyone who creates such an image or video of another adult without their consent — even if they don’t intend to share it — would face a criminal record and an unlimited fine, the UK Ministry of Justice announced Tuesday. It is already illegal in England and Wales to share explicit deepfakes without the subject’s conse﻿nt, with perpetrators facing jail time.Deepfakes are images or videos that have been manipulated, often using AI, to give the impression that someone has done or said something that they have not.Laura Farris, the United Kingdom’s Minister for Victims and Safeguarding, told ITV Tuesday that “to the best of (her) knowledge,” the two countries within the UK would be the first anywhere in the world to outlaw the creation of sexually explicit deepfakes.Under the draft law, such content would include both pornographic images and nude deepfakes, whether or not the subject is engaging in erotic behavior.The devolved governments of Scotland and Northern Ireland are responsible for passing relevant laws in those countries. A spokesperson for Northern Ireland’s justice department told CNN: “The Department is conscious of the Ministry of Justice’s proposals in this regard and is currently exploring options available for Northern Ireland.”Scotland’s justice department has not yet responded to CNN’s question about whether it planned to introduce equivalent rules.The new offense in England and Wales will be introduced through an amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill, a law currently going through parliament. Last year, changes to the Online Safety Act already criminalized the sharing of deepfake sexual images in England and Wales.The new offense applies only to adults as, under existing English and Welsh rules, creating deepfake sexual images of minors is already a crime.The creation of deepfakes has included super-imposing women’s faces, without their consent, onto sexually explicit images. Taylor Swift is perhaps the highest-profile victim of this practice. In January, such images of the singer circulated on X, receiving tens of millions of views before being taken down.That month, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the United States introduced a draft civil law that, if passed, will allow the victims of sexually explicit deepfakes to sue the people who create and share such content without their consent.A directive criminalizing the creation of sexually explicit deepfakes has also been proposed in the European Union. If the rule is passed, the bloc’s 27 member states will have to create corresponding national laws.Farris, the UK minister, said in a statement that deepfakes were examples of the “ways in which certain people seek to degrade and dehumanize others — especially women.”“This new offense sends a crystal-clear message that making this material is immoral, often misogynistic, and a crime,” she added.Meta (META), the owner of Facebook and Instagram, said Tuesday that it would review how it handles deepfake pornography after two explicit, AI-generated images of female public figures in the United States and India circulated on its platforms.“Deepfake pornography is a growing cause of gender-based harassment online and is increasingly used to target, silence and intimidate women — both on and offline,” Meta Oversight Board Co-Chair Helle Thorning-Schmidt said in a statement.This article has been updated with additional information.",2024-04-17 07:04:00,Making deepfake porn without consent could soon be a crime in England,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/16/tech/deepfake-sexually-explicit-images-criminal-offense-england-wales/index.html
Chris Isidore,"Tesla will ask its shareholders to vote to approve the 2018 pay package that made CEO Elon Musk among the world’s richest people but that a Delaware judge threw out earlier this year.The pay package gave Musk options to buy 303 million split-adjusted shares of Tesla at the cost of $23.34 a share each. At the time that a Delaware court threw out the pay package in January, it was worth $51 billion. But a drop in the value of Tesla shares since then has reduced its value to $40.7 billion.In an initial vote in 2018, 73% of Tesla shares not held by Musk or his brother at that time voted in favor of the package. The company’s proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission early Wednesday announcing plans for the vote said that “ratification will restore Tesla’s stockholder democracy.”Delaware Chancery Court Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick ruled in January that Musk and the Tesla board “bore the burden of proving that the compensation plan was fair, and they failed to meet their burden.”Tesla argued in its filing Wednesday that the pay package was fair to shareholders because the value of their shares had soared since 2018.“Because the Delaware Court second-guessed your decision, Elon has not been paid for any of his work for Tesla for the past six years that has helped to generate significant growth and stockholder value,” said Tesla chairperson Robyn Denholm in the proxy. “That strikes us — and the many stockholders from whom we already have heard — as fundamentally unfair, and inconsistent with the will of the stockholders who voted for it.”The case was brought in Delaware because that’s where Tesla and many other major companies are incorporated. Musk responded to the decision in January by tweeting “Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.”“I recommend incorporating in Nevada or Texas if you prefer shareholders to decide matters,” he said in a second tweet at that time.He announced plans soon after that to move Tesla’s state of incorporation to Texas, where its headquarters is now based. The filing Wednesday asked shareholders to approve that move of incorporation as well.“Texas is already our business home, and we are committed to it,” said Denholm.<h2>No new pay package - yet</h2>The proxy did not announce a new pay package for Musk for his work for Tesla going forward. The 2018 package would reward him for financial goals and market value of the stock that Tesla has already achieved. Musk is not paid any straight salary and only receives stock options based upon various achievements by the company.Back in January, shortly before the court’s decision, Musk said it was important that his stake in Tesla be increased as a protection against outside investors getting control of the company.“I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can’t be overturned,” Musk wrote in a post on X. “Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.”He said at that time the Tesla board was waiting for the court to make a decision in this case before it moved ahead with a new pay package. It’s not clear if a subsequent package would be announced if the shareholders again approve the 2018 compensation deal.<h2>Attorneys argued deception in 2018 vote</h2>Attorneys for the shareholders who brought the suit had argued that the package of stock options was excessive and that the directors on Tesla’s board were not truly independent and were too close to Musk to protect shareholders’ interests.They also argued that the financial targets the company had to hit for Musk to qualify for each of the 12 separate blocks, or “tranches,” of stock were not “stretch performance goals,” as the company told shareholders when seeking their approval of the package.Instead, they argued the milestones were essentially the same as the company’s internal growth projections that were being shared with banks and rating agencies, the plaintiffs’ attorneys argued in court. Therefore the original shareholder vote was tainted by that deception, according to those attorneys.<h2>Tough times for Tesla</h2>Shares of Tesla were little changed in premarket trading following the filing. Shares have lost 38% of their value so far this year as the company has reported its first year-over-year drop in sales since the height of the pandemic, in the face of increased competition and weaker than expected growth in demand for electric vehicles.In the fourth quarter of last year Tesla briefly lost its title as the world’s largest producer of electric vehices to Chinese automaker BYD, although it regained that title in the first quarter despite the drop in sales.But it has had to cut its prices to maintain demand for its cars. Those price drops have squeezed its profit margins, although it is still far more profitable than traditional automakers such as General Motors and Ford.Over the weekend Musk announced that it would be cutting more than 10% of its global staff of 140,000, and several top executives announced their departure from the company.This story was updated with additional reporting and context.",2024-04-17 08:21:00,Tesla will ask shareholders to re-approve Musk multibillion dollar payday thrown out by judge,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/17/business/tesla-shareholders-musk-pay-package/index.html
Pete Muntean,"The union representing pilots at American Airlines says it is seeing a “significant spike” in safety issues on flights.The Allied Pilots Association is warning members of “problematic trends,” including tools being left in aircraft wheel wells, collisions involving planes being towed on the ground, and “pressure to return aircraft to line service to maintain on-time performance.”The new message comes as the spotlight is on commercial flights in the US and abroad following the January 5 door plug blowout on an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9.

David Goldman,"Investors in Trump Media & Technology Group’s stock are throwing in the towel.Shares of TMTG (DJT) tumbled 14% Tuesday after closing 18% lower Monday. Driving the stock lower Tuesday: The company’s premier product, Truth Social, announced a major expansion into streaming, a notoriously cost-intensive business in which media behemoths like Disney have struggled to turn a profit.TMTG’s stock, majority-owned by former President Donald Trump, is down more than 70% from the all-time high it set on March 26, the day after it merged with a blank-check acquisition company to go public. Although the company is still worth billions of dollars, it is struggling to make money and desperate for cash. Experts have warned investors to be careful if they choose to trade the stock, because the company doesn’t have the fundamentals to back up its sky-high valuation.Trump Media lost $58 million in 2023 and made just $4.1 million in revenue. So, it announced Monday it would sell 21.5 million more shares to the public to raise cash — even though that would dilute the value for existing shareholders.<h2>A home for ‘suppressed’ content</h2>The streaming initiative didn’t give investors any reason to get enthused about the company. Truth Social said it spent the past six months testing its web, iPhone and iPad apps for live TV streaming, and it hopes to launch a content delivery network to stand up streaming apps for phones and tablets — and eventually smart TVs.Truth Social suggested its streaming network could host live news, religious programing and family-friendly shows, movies and documentaries that “has been cancelled, is at risk of cancellation, or is being suppressed on other platforms and services.”“With our streaming content, we aim to provide a permanent home for high-quality news and entertainment that face discrimination by other channels and content delivery services,” said TMTG CEO Devin Nunes, a former Republican congressman for California in a statement. “There is a lot of great content that simply can’t find an audience for unjust reasons, and we want to let these creators know they’ll soon have a guaranteed platform where they won’t be cancelled.”Truth Social’s latest push sounds similar to Elon Musk’s X, which claims to be the streaming platform that best defends free speech. But X has hundreds of millions of active users — hundreds of times Truth Social’s audience — and has still struggled to attract advertisers after Musk reshaped the business, allowing hate speech and conspiracy theories to run rampant on the platform.Trump’s association with the brand appears to be the primary reason for its sky-high valuation. That helped turn shares into a meme stock — that is, the company doesn’t trade on its fundamentals so much as it trades on emotional responses.Trump added billions of dollars to his net worth after TMTG’s merger with the blank check company in late March. But his shares’ value has plunged from a peak of $5.2 billion to about $1.8 billion. Trump’s net worth fell roughly $300 million Tuesday from the stock’s plunge.",2024-04-16 23:01:00,Trump’s stock tumbles again after Truth Social announces it’s getting into streaming,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/16/investing/trump-stock-djt-truth-social-streaming/index.html

Hadas Gold,"An organization that represents more than 2,000 news publishers sent letters on Tuesday to federal agencies, urging them to launch an investigation into Google after the tech behemoth began removing links to California-based news outlets.The move from Google, which drew swift backlash, came over a proposed law that would require tech companies to pay for news content.The News/Media Alliance, which represents US newspapers and online publications, said it had sent letters to the Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission and the California Attorney General to request an investigation into whether Google broke any laws when it limited some Californians’ ability to access news websites from Google search last week.On Friday, Google announced it had begun removing links to California news websites for some users in response to the bill that would force Google, Meta and others to pay news outlets for their content. The Mountain View-based search giant said it launched the “test” to gauge “the impact of the legislation on our product experience.”The letter asked the federal and state agencies to investigate whether Google’s move violates the Lanham Act, the Sherman Antitrust Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act as well as California’s Unruh Civil Rights Act, prohibitions against false advertising and misrepresentation, the California Consumer Privacy Act, and California’s Unfair Competition Law (UCL).“Google released no further details on how many Californians will be affected, how the Californians who will be denied news access were chosen, what publications will be affected, how long the compelled news blackouts will persist, and whether access will be blocked entirely or just to content Google particularly disfavors,” the letter stated. “Because of these unknowns, there are many ways Google’s unilateral decision to turn off access to news websites for Californians could violate [various] laws.”In a statement, News/Media Alliance president and chief executive Danielle Coffey said that Google has too much power.“No one company should be permitted to control information so singularly that it can make decisions to the detriment of society, as Google has done in California,” Coffey said. “We call on government agencies to take action to address the various ways this activity could violate existing antitrust and other relevant laws.”In a statement Tuesday, a Google spokesperson said, “These baseless claims deflect the real issues with [the California Journalism Preservation Act] — this bill is unworkable and will hurt small, local publishers to benefit large, out-of-state hedge funds.”The California Journalism Preservation Act would require digital platforms like Google and Meta to pay a “journalism usage fee” to eligible news outlets when they use their content alongside digital ads.“We have proposed reasonable alternatives to CJPA that would increase our support for the California news ecosystem and support Californians’ access to news,” the Google spokesperson said. “We’ve long said CJPA isn’t the right approach, and we’ve taken a responsible and transparent step to prepare for its possible implementationEarlier, California State Senate President Pro-Tempore Mike McGuire, a co-author of the California Journalism Preservation Act, called the move an act of “bullying” and an “abuse of power.”“This is a dangerous threat by Google that not only sets a terrible precedent here in America, but puts public safety at risk for Californians who depend on the news to keep us informed of life-threatening emergencies and local public safety incidents,” he wrote in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. “This is a breach of public trust and we call on Google Executives to answer for this stunt.”Charles F. Champion, the president and CEO of the California News Publishers Association, said the move by Google was suppressing California news.“The fact that one company can shut down the means by which 90% of the public find online content in order to achieve their own political and business ends show just how much policymakers need to act, and act now,” he posted Friday on X. “Google is not above the law, and they should not be allowed to act as if they are.”",2024-04-16 21:48:00,News publishers group urges government to investigate Google for blocking some California news outlets,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/16/media/news-publishers-group-urges-government-investigate-google/index.html
Oliver Darcy,"Editor’s Note: A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.America’s right-wing forces would have you believe that they are the courageous entities standing up for free speech.But, as they try to claim that mantle, many of those same forces in media and politics are behind a disturbing wave of book bans sweeping the nation.PEN America, a non-profit organization committed to protecting free expression, published an alarming report Tuesday indicating that the “book ban crisis” is only getting worse. The bans are “speeding up,” the organization warned in its report, a troublesome trend that is impacting public school systems from coast-to-coast.“There were over 4,000 instances of book bans in the first half of this school year—more than all of last school year as a whole. This is a marked increase in comparison to the last spring semester, in which PEN America recorded 1,841 book bans,” the group said in the report, aptly titled “Banned in the USA.”The bans started in haste in early 2021, birthed in the backlash to Nikole Hannah-Jones’s 1619 Project at The New York Times. At the time, the concern among conservatives was that schools were using books to supposedly indoctrinate young students with critical race theory, an academic concept that became a culture war flashpoint and sparked hysteria in right-wing circles. Over time, the bans have grown to encompass other topics, notably gender ideology.The censorship has been fueled by the right-wing media machine (which again, purports to be pro-free speech), with entities such as “Libs of TikTok” targeting specific school systems and effectively waging pressure campaigns against administrators to take certain works off the library shelves.Some of the books removed from schools across the country include Margaret Atwood’s acclaimed dystopian-novel-turned-Hulu-adaptation “The Handmaid’s Tale,” Amy Reed’s novel “The Nowhere Girls,” Rupi Kaur’s NYT bestseller “Milk and Honey,” Ta-Nehisi Coates’s memoir “Between the World and Me” and others.“Those who want to ban books are attempting to use obscenity law and hyperbolic rhetoric about ‘porn in schools’ to justify banning books about sexual violence and LGBTQ+ topics (and in particular, trans identities). In doing so, they have also disproportionately targeted books by women and nonbinary authors,” PEN America said. “The movement to ban books also continues to focus on themes of race and racism by advancing rhetoric disparaging ‘critical race theory,’ ‘woke ideology,’ and efforts to ensure library collections are diverse and inclusive.”Such brazen book bans — unprecedented in modern American history — is at its worst in the red states of Florida and Texas. In Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a law last year that led to the removal of books from public school shelves, more than 5,100 books were banned between July 2021 and December 2023, according to PEN America. In Texas, the number was more than 1,500, the group said.The bans have also led to harassment against the authors who suddenly find themselves hurled into the information wars. Abdi Nazemian, a gay Iranian-American author, said during a press call organized by PEN America on Tuesday that “nothing could have prepared” him for “the experience of having my book banned.”“First and foremost, a heartbreak over the message it sends to young queer kids who deserve love and support. But also just the fear over all the online threats I’ve received,” Nazemian said. “I’ve been called a pedophile and a groomer. I’ve been called filthy, indecent, profane, shady, slimy.”PEN America said Tuesday that there is one glimmer of hope: growing resistance to the bans. Every major publisher is now actively supporting a legal case to halt book banning in Iowa. And, across the country, ordinary people are getting involved to put an end to the trend.“We see students at the forefront, leading protests, read-ins, marching to oppose censorship and educational censorship in particular happening and plaguing their schools and school libraries,” Kasey Meehan, the program director of PEN America’s Freedom to Read, said Tuesday. “And, of course, we’re joined by incredible voices of authors and parents and other advocates that are leading efforts to be as coordinated, as well resourced, and as organized as those efforts to remove books in the first place.”",2024-04-17 09:03:00,Book bans are accelerating across the country amid right-wing pressure campaign,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/17/media/right-wing-book-bans-accelerating/index.html
"Diksha Madhok,Rachel Wilson","In just a few days, India will commence the world’s largest democratic election.An estimated 960 million people in a country of 1.4 billion are eligible to vote in the polls, which start on Friday and will take more than a month to complete. Narendra Modi is widely expected to clinch a rare third consecutive five-year term as prime minister.Under his leadership, India is poised to become a 21st-century economic powerhouse, offering a real alternative to China for investors and consumer brands hunting for growth and manufacturers looking to reduce risks in their supply chains.While ties between Beijing and the West are becoming increasingly frayed, India enjoys healthy relations with most major economies and is aggressively wooing large companies to set up factories in the country.So, is the hype around Modi’s India, which remains a largely impoverished country, justified?The quality of economic data in India can be unreliable, which makes it tough to evaluate the reality on the ground in the world’s most populous nation.But by using data from official or authoritative sources, CNN has created five charts to show how the country has performed since Modi first rose to power in 2014, and to look ahead at the challenges the next leader will face in managing the world’s fastest growing major economy.<h2>Still very poor</h2>India’s economy was worth $3.7 trillion in 2023, making it the world’s fifth largest, having jumped four spots in the rankings during Modi’s decade in office.The South Asian giant’s economy is comfortably placed to expand at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years, but analysts say it should be targeting growth of 8% or more if it wants to become an economic superpower.Sustained expansion will push India higher up the ranks of the world’s biggest economies, with some observers forecasting the country to become number three behind only the US and China by 2027.However, India could do much more to raise its gross domestic product (GDP) per person, a measure of living standards according to which it ranked a lowly 147 in 2022, according to the World Bank.According to Guido Cozzi, professor of macroeconomics at the University of St Gallen in Switzerland, there will be “trickle down effects on per-capita GDP” as the economy grows. But he cautioned that “trickle-down economics is not guaranteed to reduce income inequality, and policies that promote inclusive growth may be necessary.”<h2>Building modern India</h2>Much as China did more than three decades ago, India is beginning a massive infrastructure transformation by spending billions on building roads, ports, airports and railways. Meanwhile, private investors are building the world’s biggest green energy plant.In this year’s federal budget alone, $134 billion was carved out for capital spending to boost economic expansion.The results can be seen on the ground with furious construction underway across the nation. India added nearly 55,000 kilometers (around 35,000 miles) to the national highway network, an increase of 60% in the overall length, between 2014 and 2023. Infrastructure development has many benefits for the economy, including creating jobs and improving the ease of doing business.In recent years, the country has also built a range of tech platforms — known as digital public infrastructure — that have transformed lives and businesses.For example, the Aadhaar program, launched in 2009, has provided millions of Indians with proof of identity for the first time ever. The world’s largest biometric database has also helped the government save millions by reducing corruption in welfare initiatives.Another platform, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), allows users to make payments instantly by scanning a QR code. It has been embraced by Indians from all walks of life, from coffee shop owners to beggars, and allowed millions of dollars to flow into the formal economy.In September 2023, citing a World Bank report, Modi said that thanks to its digital public infrastructure “India has achieved financial inclusion targets in just six years which would otherwise have taken at least 47 long years.”<h2>Stock market superpower</h2>The excitement around India’s growth potential is reflected in its stock market, which has been hitting record highs. The value of companies listed on India’s exchanges surpassed $4 trillion late last year.India has two major exchanges: the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) and the BSE, Asia’s oldest bourse formerly known as the Bombay Stock Exchange.Thanks to the sizzling rally, the NSE has overtaken both the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Exchange to become the world’s sixth largest bourse, data from the World Federation of Exchanges showed in January.Domestic investors, both retail and institutional, have been driving India’s stock market to unprecedented peaks.According to Macquarie Capital, retail investors alone own 9% of India’s equity market value, while foreign investors are at slightly less than 20%. Analysts, however, expect foreign investments to pick up in the second half of 2024, once the election is out of the way.<h2>Humming factories</h2>The Modi government is aggressively trying to capitalize on the massive rethink underway among companies on supply chains. International firms want to diversify their operations away from China, where they faced obstacles during the pandemic and are threatened by rising tension between Beijing and Washington.Asia’s third largest economy has launched a production-linked incentive program worth $26 billion to attract companies to set up manufacturing in 14 sectors, ranging from electronics and automobiles to pharmaceuticals and medical devices.As a result, some of the world’s biggest firms, including Apple (AAPL) supplier Foxconn, are expanding their operations significantly in India.Billionaire Elon Musk said last week on X that he is “looking forward” to meeting Modi in India, without giving a date. The Tesla (TSLA) boss is expected to announce a major investment in India soon, with the automaker reportedly scouring the country for a suitable location for its first Asian factory outside China.Until two years ago, Apple would typically start assembling models in the country only seven to eight months after launch. That changed in September 2022, when Apple started making new iPhone 14 devices in India weeks after they went on sale.Analysts have called the change in strategy a big win for Modi, as growing manufacturing ties with a US giant like Apple will in turn attract other global players in the electronics manufacturing ecosystem to India.According to market research firm Canalys, up to 23% of iPhones will be made in India by the end of 2025, up from 6% in 2022.<h2>Where are the jobs?</h2>Still, India’s economy, much like its democracy, is far from perfect. If re-elected, Modi has to tackle the enormous challenge of creating hundreds of millions of jobs for a population that remains largely impoverished.With an average age of 29 years, India has one of the youngest populations globally, but the country is not yet able to reap the potential economic benefits from its large, youthful population.According to a report last month by the International Labour Organization, educated Indians between the ages of 15 and 29 are more likely to be unemployed than those without any schooling, which reflects “a mismatch with their aspirations and available jobs.”Youth unemployment rates in India are now higher than global levels, it added.The unemployment rate for young Indians with a graduate degree was over 29%, almost nine times higher those who can’t read or write, the report said.“The Indian economy has not been able to create enough remunerative jobs in the non-farm sectors for new educated youth labour force entrants, which is reflected in the high and increasing unemployment rate,” it added.",2024-04-17 05:29:00,Can India become an economic superpower?

You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.It’s been a volatile few years for US college entrance exams, and the companies that run them, as universities around the country try to figure out what’s the best way to evaluate prospective students.In the midst of that turmoil, the companies (often nonprofits) that create these tests have been slammed by financial losses.Now, private equity firms are swooping in to help while taking majority stakes in exchange.That’s worrying some education advocates.What’s happening: ACT Inc., the Iowa-based nonprofit behind the eponymous college entrance exam, has been having a tough time. About 1.4 million students in the U.S. took the ACT in 2023, a small increase from the year before, but the numbers have not returned to pre-pandemic levels.The company recorded a net loss of $12 million in fiscal year 2022, $6 million in 2021 and $60.5 million in 2020.Last week, the company announced that it would partner with California-based private equity firm Nexus Capital Management and move its test into a for-profit company.ACT Inc. says that this cash infusion will help expand and enhance services beyond testing. “At this moment in time, 40% of students leaving high school on average are going straight to the workforce,” ACT CEO Janet Godwin told CNN. “I think Nexus sees with ACT the absolute need that our nation has to make sure that we are developing talent for the needs of our employers.”Godwin, who will retain her position, declined to share the monetary details of the deal with Nexus but said it would bring “opportunities for inorganic growth” like mergers and acquisitions, strategic portfolio investments and access to new talent.It is “a very persistent misconception” that ACT is in “economic duress,” she said.“We had impacts with Covid when schools were shut down and we weren’t able to operate at the scale that we typically do. But since 2021, we’ve been growing our revenues and we’ve rebounded very significantly.”Nexus did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The transparency problem: Still, some economists and education advocates worry that the move will decrease transparency in the testing process.“A private equity buyout of the ACT sets off a lot of alarm bells for me,” Charlie Eaton, an associate professor of sociology and cofounder of the Higher Education, Race, and the Economy (HERE) Lab at the University of California, Merced, told CNN.“There’s a reason why we typically have nonprofits deliver public goods like college admissions exams. People need to be able to trust that there’s a fair evaluation process so nothing gets distorted.”Nonprofit companies are subject to regulatory oversight and disclosure requirements, which help ensure that transparency and maintain public confidence.A company owned by private equity can obfuscate what the company actually does to the public and potentially to regulators.The ACT will become a “public benefit corporation,” which means it is supposed to take the public good and shareholder interests into account. Still, that does not exempt it from taxes or from distributing its profits to its new owners.Nexus Capital Management’s portfolio also includes Savvas Learning Company, which specializes in designing K-12 curriculums.“If a private equity firm has input in the testing but they also own a company that develops the curriculum, they have control over the entire process,” said Azani Creeks, a senior research and campaign coordinator at the Private Equity Shareholder Project.“They have a lot of control in ways that are not transparent. With something as important as college admissions testing you want that transparency. Nonprofits have to share a lot of information with the public, private equity-owned structures don’t,” she added.ACT says it will not immediately raise test prices and that current, nonprofit ACT will retain a minority interest in the company and continue its research on education and the workplace.Godwin told CNN that she has heard and understands the concerns, but that ACT partnered with Nexus because of its “track record of working in education in a transparent way” and with the intention of creating long-term value instead of chasing profit.Critics remain skeptical.“We should be worried about industries where there are a lot of government subsidies available, where consumers often are not well informed, and where there’s a lot of market power for firms,” said Constantine Yannelis, an associate professor of finance at University of Chicago Booth School of Business. “I think the testing industry is unfortunately one of those industries where all three of those factors apply pretty strongly.”A lot of colleges that are state-owned and receive government subsidies use the ACT to admit students and to administer aid, he said. “I worry that profitability could come at the expense of students, and particularly students coming from lower income families.”A broad problem: It’s not just the ACT that’s going the way of private equity.“This is a story about the fact that testing is going downhill in the US,” said Rebecca Winthrop, a senior fellow and director of the Center for Universal Education at the Brookings Institution. “All of these companies are actively shifting how they think about their products and the roles of testing. They’re losing money because people are questioning their merits.”That means they need to expand.Private equity investment in education services amounted to $2.09 billion across 31 deals in the quarter to June 20, 2023, surpassing the $1.42 billion recorded in the second quarter of 2022, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data.Private equity firms “come into industries that are already suffering from a lack of funding,” said Creeks. “All of these issues with standardized testing predate private equity. They’ve had a lack of funding and support and so sometimes private equity is the only viable option. That’s why I really support government regulation and increased funding for funding.”Between 2019 and 2022 the nonprofit College Board saw its revenue from the SAT exam plummet to $289.2 million from $403.6 million, as colleges ended or eased their testing requirements.While the College Board is still a registered nonprofit, it administered the SAT exam through Cambium (owned by private equity firm Veritas Capital) through the summer of 2023.“During the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, we saw the number of students taking the SAT decrease significantly,” a College Board representative told CNN. “Since then, we have seen strong interest in the SAT from students from all backgrounds.”<h2>Powell warns that rate cuts will likely come later than expected</h2>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made a rare public appearance away from the confines of the central bank press room on Tuesday when he joined Tiff Macklem, governor of the Bank of Canada, in a policy forum focused on US-Canada economic relations.US stocks briefly wavered Tuesday after Powell said during the wide-ranging conversation that a “lack of further progress” on inflation means the central bank likely won’t cut interest rates at its upcoming policy meeting just two weeks away, keeping them higher for longer.“The recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence” that inflation is headed toward the central bank’s 2% goal, Powell said during the moderated discussion hosted by the Wilson Center. Instead, he said, there are indications “that it is likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence.”“Right now, given the strength of the labor market and progress on inflation so far, it’s appropriate to allow restrictive policy further time to work and let the data and the evolving outlook guide us,” the Fed chief said.Interest rates are currently nestled at a 23-year high after the Fed launched an aggressive rate-hiking campaign two years ago, reports my colleague Bryan Mena.Inflation is down considerably from a four-decade peak reached in the summer of 2022, but recent inflation reports have shown persistent price pressures in services and housing.Higher borrowing costs, coupled with elevated prices for essentials, have forced many Americans to cut back. And while the US economy and the job market remain on strong footing, higher mortgage rates have all but stalled the housing market.<h2>Boeing’s problems just cost United $200 million</h2>United Airlines was pushed into the red by Boeing and its ongoing quality issues, the airline said Tuesday.The company took a $200 million hit in the first quarter after the Boeing 737 Max 9 was grounded following the door plug incident aboard an Alaska Airlines flight, reports my colleague Chris Isidore.United did not say whether or not it expects to be reimbursed by Boeing for the cost of the grounding of its 737 Max 9s for three weeks following the January 5 incident. But it did say that it would have been profitable without the cost of the grounding.The blowout of a door plug on an Alaska Airlines flight caused a three-week grounding by the Federal Aviation Administration of the 737 Max 9 model of jets, and brought fresh questions about the safety and quality of Boeing planes. United, which depends on Boeing planes for about 80% of its mainline fleet, had 86 of the Max 9 jets, more than any other airline in the world, and it was hit particularly hard by Boeing’s problems.",2024-04-17 09:28:00,Private equity finds its next bet: college admissions,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/17/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html
Chris Isidore,"United Airlines was pushed into the red by Boeing and its ongoing quality issues, the airline said Tuesday. The company took a $200 million hit in the first quarter after the Boeing 737 Max 9 was grounded following the door plug incident aboard an Alaska Airlines flight.United did not say whether or not it expects to be reimbursed by Boeing for the cost of the grounding of its 737 Max 9s for three weeks following the January 5 incident. But it did say that it would have been profitable without the cost of the grounding.The blow out of a door plug on an Alaska Airlines flight caused a three-week grounding by the Federal Aviation Administration of the 737 Max 9 model of jets, and brought fresh questions about the safety and quality of Boeing planes. United, which depends on Boeing planes for about 80% of its mainline fleet, had 86 of the Max 9 jets, more than any other airline in the world and it was hit particularly hard by Boeing’s problems.But United has also been hit with a series of other incidents, including engines catching on fire and wheels falling off of planes, problems that got increased attention in the wake of Boeing’s problems. It has forced United CEO Scott Kirby to reach out to customers to assure them the airline would itself make a greater focus on safety by its own employees. The FAA has also said it is putting United under greater scrutiny.Boeing’s publicity woes and the grounding of the jets weren’t the only way that the airplane manufacturer hurt United.The airline said Tuesday it now expects to take delivery of only 61 single-aisle jets from Boeing this year, or 40 fewer than it had anticipated at the start of the year. The airline had previously disclosed it had put a freeze on the hiring of pilots, and that it is asking pilots to accept voluntary unpaid furloughs due to the cut in the number of flights it is operating.United now says it no longer expects the Boeing 737 Max 10, the latest and longest version of the Boeing 737, to be delivered this year. That plane has not been certified to carry passengers as yet by the FAA. With questions about the quality and safety of Boeing jets, the certification has likely been pushed back to at least 2025.So United said it has converted a portion of those Max 10 orders to the Max 9 for deliveries from 2025 through 2027, and said it may convert more orders to the smaller versions of that plane.Of more concern to Boeing, United also said Tuesday that it has reached agreements with two lessors to lease 35 new Airbus A321neos, a 737 Max competitor. Deliveries of those Airbus planes is due in 2026 and 2027.Asked for a comment on United’s loss estimate, Boeing pointed to comments made to investors last month by Brian West, its CFO, that suggested Boeing is prepared to compensate affected airline customers.“We put the customers in tight spot,” he said. “As it pertains to the events of January the 5th, of course, there’s customer consideration that is going to manifest itself in the quarter and we’ve got to take care of that and we’re well down the road to do that. And we continue to stand behind our customers with that responsibility.”United said it had an adjusted loss of $50 million in the quarter, an improvement from the $207 million loss it had in the same period of last year. Revenue was up nearly 10% to $12.5 million.Most of that gain came because the miles flown by paying passengers rose 9%, as United was able to increase capacity from a year earlier despite the 737 Max 9 grounding. The measures of fares, such as the average amount paid by passengers for each available seat, adjusted for miles flown, were up about 1%.",2024-04-17 09:30:00,Boeing’s problems just cost United $200 million,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/16/business/boeing-cost-united-200-million/index.html
Samantha Murphy Kelly,"Apple has fixed a bug that suggested the Palestinian flag emoji when some users searched for the word “Jerusalem” in the emoji keyboard.On Tuesday, the company addressed the bug with the latest beta software release of iOS 17.5, just a few days after it said it was working on a fix.Apple’s previous update was introduced on March 21, but the recent discovery of the bug upset some users on social media. In one April 9 post on X viewed more than 2.3 million times, an iPhone user questioned whether Apple was aware of the error – and whether it was intentional. Apple said at the time the issue was a mistake and not coded into the keyboard intentionally.But the user, who said she was Jewish, provided a long list of other cities that don’t surface a flag when entered into the emoji search box. It’s possible, however, Apple’s machine-learning technology determined the suggested emoji based on analyzing texts from millions of its users.The history of the region is complicated, and territorial claims in the ancient city are no less so. In 1967, Israel captured East Jerusalem along with other regions and later annexed that as part of Jerusalem to unify the city as its capital – although much of the international community recognizes East Jerusalem as Israel-occupied Palestinian territory. For its part, Israel considers Jerusalem as its undivided capital. In 2017, the US administration of President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, reversing decades of American foreign policy.So suggesting a Palestinian flag emoji for the search query “Jerusalem,” particularly when Israel is at war with Hamas, added tensions amid a long-running dispute.",2024-04-17 10:43:00,Apple fixes iPhone bug that suggested Palestinian flag when some people typed ‘Jerusalem’,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/17/tech/apple-bug-fix-jerusalem-palestinian-flag-emoji/index.html
Samantha Delouya,"Record-breaking heat waves, severe floods and acute wildfires, exacerbated by climate change, carry a colossal price tag: an approximately 19% reduction in global income over just the next 26 years, a new study published Wednesday found.That financial gut punch won’t just affect big governments and corporations. According to the United Nations, the world is heading toward a gain of nearly 3 degrees of global warming in the next century, even with current climate policies and goals – and researchers say individuals could bear the economic burden.The researchers in Wednesday’s study, published in Nature, said financial pain in the short-term is inevitable, even if governments ramp up their efforts to tackle the crisis now.“These impacts are unavoidable in the sense that they are indistinguishable across different future emission scenarios until 2049,” two of the study’s researchers from the Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research, Maximilian Kotz and Leonie Wenz, told CNN via email.However, they say immediate actions to reduce climate change could stem some losses in the longer term.Noah Diffenbaugh, a professor and environmental researcher at Stanford University, said the economic damage from climate change will take different shapes. Not only can extreme weather events result in costly repairs to damaged property, but elevated temperatures can also impact agriculture, labor productivity, and even cognitive ability in some cases.<h2>It’s not too late to prevent future losses</h2>While discourse about the cost of climate change often refers to potentially expensive mitigation efforts like curbing oil and gas use or technology to pull carbon pollution out of the air, investing in greener technology, the study argued that short-term financial damage wrought by climate change already outweighs the cost of trying to solve the crisis.Researchers estimated it would cost the global economy $6 trillion by 2050 to comply with the Paris Climate Agreement—the international agreement among nearly 200 nations to tackle climate change—compared to the study’s estimated $38 trillion economic damage due to climate change.“Adaptation could offer ways to reduce these damages,” the researchers Kotz and Wenz said.Bernardo Bastien, a researcher at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego, said that adaptation strategies, which are approaches designed not to reduce climate change, but to respond by limiting its negative effects, could help save money on a longer time horizon.Bastien gave an example: utility companies in the state of California that have shut down the electrical grid to prevent wildfires.“When you turn off electrical grids, you’re turning off industry and you’re turning off a lot of households that use electricity for their well-being,” Bastien said. “It’s very costly but very necessary.”And while the study concludes some economic damage is guaranteed before 2049, its authors argue that benefits from curbing climate change could emerge a few decades down the line.“Damage estimates diverge strongly across emission scenarios after 2049, conveying the clear benefits from mitigation from a purely economic point of view,” the study said.<h2>Poorer countries see a larger income drag</h2>However, the expected financial hit won’t be distributed evenly.Diffenbaugh, who was not associated with the study, said that while research showing the aggregate impact of climate change is important, “embedded in those aggregate impacts are very stark disparities in who is most impacted by climate change.”“We have clear evidence that overall, the poor are harmed more,” he said. “That’s what’s likely to happen from the global warming that’s already occurred and what’s likely to happen even for small increments of global warming.”The Nature study estimated the economic damage of different regions. North America and Europe are expected to see a lower income reduction in the next 26 years at 11%, compared to South Asia and Africa at 22%.The United States, a historically large polluter, will take a smaller economic hit than some neighboring countries, according to the study. However, it won’t be spared from disruptions caused by a warming planet — especially younger generations of Americans.A different paper, published Tuesday in Consumer Reports from global consulting firm ICF, estimates that the lifetime personal cost of climate change for a baby born in the US in 2024 could be as high as $500,000.The ICF paper said price hikes on essential elements of the cost of living in the US will add up due to climate change. Housing costs are projected to increase by $125,000 over the lifetime of a person born in 2024, owing to elevated maintenance and insurance costs due to the risks of flooding and other weather-related damage, the paper said. Food prices are also seen rising by an estimated $33,000 over the lifetime of a 2024 baby, due to disruptions to agriculture and supply chains, the paper said. Other expenses, like energy, transportation and health care, are expected to balloon in the next few decades, as well.“For many Americans, this financial loss will require difficult decisions about how to pay for food, housing, and other daily expenses, which climate change will increase by approximately 9 percent over their lifetime,” the paper said.",2024-04-17 11:33:00,"Climate change will make you poorer, according to a new report",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/17/business/climate-change-disasters-economic-cost/index.html

In 2022, Puerta sued Snapchat in a wrongful death lawsuit. At the time, his lawsuit was one of the first to accuse social media of posing a danger to children’s health.Now there are hundreds of such lawsuits against social media platforms, alleging teenagers across the country have been harmed from exposure to social media, according to Matthew Bergman, the founder of the Social Media Victims Law Center, from where many of these lawsuits have been filed. In some of the cases, families allege their children used social media to buy drugs; in other cases, parents say their teens saw dangerous content and harmed themselves. There is a range of harms and heartbreak alleged in the filings.Meta, TikTok and Snapchat outline on their websites that they prohibit content that promotes self-harm and the sales of prescription and opioid drugs. The platforms also have tools that allow parents to set time limits for their teens on the apps, verify user ages and restrict who they can message.“We want to reassure every parent that we have their interests at heart in the work we’re doing to help provide teens with safe experiences online,” a Meta spokesperson told CNN. “These are complex issues but we will continue working with experts and listening to parents to develop new tools, features and policies that are effective and meet the needs of teens and their families.”The social media companies filed motions to dismiss some of the cases under the First Amendment and Section 230, which states that tech companies cannot be held liable for some of the content that users post to their platforms. However, some cases, including with Puerta’s lawsuit, have already been approved to move forward in the court of law. All cases are still pending.Snap did not comment on the status of some of the lawsuits but directed CNN to its community guides. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment.But with little movement in the courts or from lawmakers and drawn-out battles with regulators against Big Tech, some of those grieving families are looking elsewhere for progress. Instead of waiting for others to act, they are now teaming up with nonprofits, starting their own organizations and connecting with each other to try to save children across the country.“All I am is a bereaved father who wants to make sure this doesn’t keep happening,” Puerta told CNN. “My son made a mistake [on social media] but it shouldn’t have cost him his life.”Soon after Daniel died, Puerta founded an organization called VOID – Victims of Illicit Drugs – which offers parents and educators resources about the dangers of fentanyl-laced drugs and social media.He said he has met with the Los Angeles police department, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Homeland Security and other government agencies to address the topic. He also hosts student assemblies at high schools where he screens a short film that follows four families, including his own, who lost children to fentanyl-laced drugs purchased on social media platforms.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly 80,000 people died from opioid overdoses in the US in 2022, many of which came from fentanyl and other synthetic drugs. Some drug traffickers advertise on social media platforms often via 24-hour disappearing posts, along with code words and emojis to evade law enforcement and platform algorithms, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.Federal prosecutors are reportedly investigating Meta for its role in the sale of illicit drugs on Facebook and Instagram, according to a Wall Street Journal report published last month. In a response to the report, the company told CNN it proactively cooperates with law enforcement authorities to help combat the sale and distribution of illicit drugs, which is against its policies.“The government wasn’t being proactive enough, so I knew I had to be,” Puerta told CNN. “The stigma of overdose and drugs makes you think that person must have been a drug addict or used too much. But what most people don’t understand is that fentanyl is taking the lives of non-addicted first-time users.”<h2>The making of a movement</h2>The motivation to reach lawmakers is common among families who say their children’s lives were lost due to social media. Gail Flatt, who sued Snapchat and Meta in 2022 alleging her 14-year-old daughter Sarah’s “addiction” to the platforms led to sleep deprivation, anxiety and ultimately death by suicide in 2019, has been meeting with lawmakers over what she describes as problems with the sites’ algorithms.The lawsuit, which is pending in a Northern District of California Court, states Sarah constantly checked Snapchat and Instagram and fell down “rabbit holes” that ultimately led her to thoughts of suicide and self-injury.Flatt recently met with Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn from Tennessee to support the development of the bipartisan Kids Online Safety Act, which would give kids more online protections, such as opting out of algorithmic recommendations and ensuring higher privacy settings for young users. She was also invited by Sen. Blackburn to attend President Biden’s State of the Union address last month, in which he discussed the need to minimize the risks of social media for kids.And when Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized to the families who’ve suffered because of his platform during a recent congressional hearing, Flatt was among the parents who held up pictures of their deceased children as he spoke.“I’m trying to help save other children’s lives,” said Flatt, noting she wants her daughter’s face to serve as a warning that more children could be hurt until changes are made.“I want companies to know, as a mother, what my son went through with depression, comparing himself to others and doing the challenges he saw on social media that were exposed to him by the algorithms,” she told CNN.Norma Nazario, whose 15-year-old son Zackery died last year in a New York subway surfing accident after he found videos of the trend on social media, said she feels similarly. When New York City Mayor Eric Adams recently announced the city is suing five social media companies, alleging their platforms’ designs exploit young users’ mental health and cost New York $100 million in related health programs and services each year, Nazario stood next to him during the press conference.She has a wrongful death lawsuit pending against TikTok, its parent company ByteDance and Meta, which alleges the platforms’ algorithms were responsible for what the lawsuit describes as her son’s social media addiction. Next, she said she wants to work with lawmakers to help increase the age requirement to access social media sites.Last month, Florida Republican Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill into law banning children under age 14 from having their own social media accounts. (Fourteen and 15-year-olds will be allowed to have accounts with parental consent).A mother featured in the same film as Jaime Puerta – Amy Neville, whose 14-year-old son Alexander died after taking a pure fentanyl pill she believes was purchased on Snapchat in 2020 – also travels across the US to show the documentary to students. She screens several other films she’s been involved with too, including one that examines the reported drug market Snapchat has made available to kids. Neville helped fund the production for one of the films.“I do this because it keeps me connected to Alexander and lets me talk about him,” she said. “It’s an overwhelming thought that it could happen to someone else. If I can do something to help them, I will.”She also founded the Alexander Neville Foundation, which offers resources about the problem, and started a course called the Parent Connections Academy in her local community to empower parents with more information about fentanyl. Neville said she has submitted a proposal to Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota to create a new national holiday in June called Social Media Victims Remembrance Day. Sen. Klobuchar did not immediately respond to a request for comment.<h2>Finding community</h2>Families who’ve been shaken because of their children’s use of social media are coming together to find a sense of community, too.Sabine Polak, a mother from Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, first spoke publicly about how her daughter struggled with social media addiction back in 2021. In an interview with CNN at the time, she revealed her 14-year-old daughter was working through depression and had contemplated suicide. The teen ultimately received treatment in a rehab institution, after an intervention with her school counselor, and has made great progress, according to Polak.But that period changed the trajectory of Polak’s life. When another mother in her town, Mileva Repasky, read about Polak’s story on CNN, she reached out; her son also struggled with social media addiction.“It brought her to tears because she was going through something so eerily similar with her teenage son, even with that call from the counselor out of nowhere,” Polak said. “We both couldn’t believe that not only were we in the same area but our kids were in the same school district.”They eventually launched a nonprofit called the Phone-Free Schools Movement, which meets with administrators to help schools restrict or ban phone use during the school day as a way for students to disconnect, focus on classwork and cut down on cyberbullying, cheating and other distractions.“We are receiving a lot of messages from parents wanting to start a movement in their own schools, and even administrators asking for resources on how to implement a phone-free policy,” Polak said.She said connecting with Repasky gave her motivation to draw more attention to a crisis that not everyone is willing to discuss.But it’s not just parents who are advocating for change and finding support in their local communities. Nineteen-year-old Cece Neltner from Independence, Kentucky – who filed a lawsuit in July 2022 against Meta alleging Instagram pushed her toward harmful content on the platform without her consent – joined a student-led discussion group with neighboring high schools to talk about the damage social media can inflict on teenagers’ mental health.At age 12, Neltner said she signed up for Instagram as a way to stay connected with her mother while she stayed part-time at her father’s home. The two started sharing recipes, but over time, she says, Instagram pushed her toward posts about anorexia and bulimia. After the platform connected her with users, groups, videos and posts with tips and tricks on how to hide the fact that she was not eating, she went into heart failure and was hospitalized for anorexia nervosa, according to the lawsuit.“The [discussion] group gave me the biggest sense of perspective,” said Neltner, who became a group leader. “You talk to different kids that you may sit next to in class but learn a lot about them, their mental health and what’s affecting them. It made me feel less alone and … like I want to do more.”Meanwhile, Donna and Chris Dawley – who claimed in a 2022 lawsuit that social media sites played a significant role in the decision of their 17-year-old son CJ to end his life – said they initially didn’t know other families who were facing the same hardships. “Now we know so many,” Donna Dawley told CNN.Over the last two years, the Dawleys have spoken at various conferences and events to share their story, including at the Archewell Foundation Parents’ Summit on World Health Day. They are also part of a network of families affiliated with a charitable organization, founded by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, that provides counselors and resources to parents who have experienced tragic loss connected to their child’s social media use.“We are so grateful to have found other families speaking out about what’s happening,” Donna Dawley said. “It’s like having an extended family. We always text each other to see if someone is having a bad day and send support.”But she said it still hurts to hear new stories of children losing their lives to the dangers associated with social media.“We’ve been talking so much about this, but it makes me feel like we haven’t done enough, even though I know we can’t do everything,” she said. “If social media companies would just fix these algorithms, there wouldn’t be more grieving parents.”",2024-04-17 11:50:00,Families who sued social media companies years ago are taking matters into their own hands,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/13/tech/families-suing-social-media-companies-advocacy/index.html
Hanna Ziady,"The high and rising level of US government debt risks driving up borrowing costs around the world and undermining global financial stability, the International Monetary Fund has warned.The IMF said Wednesday that increased government spending, growing public debt and elevated interest rates in the United States had contributed to high and volatile yields — or interest rates — on Treasuries, raising the risk of higher rates elsewhere.Its analysis found that a spike in yields on long-term US government bonds is associated with similar surges in government bond yields in other advanced and developing economies, with the latter suffering exchange rate turbulence as well.“Loose fiscal policy in the United States exerts upward pressure on global interest rates and the dollar,” Vitor Gaspar, director of the IMF’s fiscal affairs department, told reporters. “It pushes up funding costs in the rest of the world, thereby exacerbating existing fragilities and risks.”It’s the second time this week the IMF has fired a shot across the bows of the US government. On Tuesday, it said public spending and borrowing was contributing to an overheating of the US economy, making it harder for the Federal Reserve to defeat inflation.Higher interest rates make it more costly for households and businesses to service their loans, which can lead to defaults that cause losses at banks and other lenders, increasing financial instability.The IMF’s warning will add to concerns about the broader consequences of ballooning US government debt, which the Treasury Department puts at nearly $35 trillion.On Tuesday, Treasury yields touched fresh highs for the year after Fed chair Jerome Powell signaled that official interest rates could stay high for a while yet because of persistent inflation in the United States.US consumer prices have been propped up by debt-fueled government spending — including pandemic stimulus — which has boosted households’ spending power and turbocharged economic growth.Loose US fiscal policy, in addition to increasing the country’s already hefty debt burden, could make “the last mile” of getting inflation back down to the Fed’s target harder to achieve, the IMF said.The Washington-based agency is also worried that, if US inflation stays high, it could dash investors’ hopes for interest rate cuts, leading to a selloff of financial assets, including stocks and government bonds around the world. A resulting fall in the price of bonds would raise their yields.“Under this scenario, financial conditions would broadly tighten,” Tobias Adrian, director of the IMF’s monetary and capital markets department, wrote Tuesday in a blog accompanying the agency’s Global Financial Stability Report. “Globally, borrowers would find it harder to service debt, given higher bond yields,” he added.According to Gaspar, the problem could be especially acute in low-income countries, where constraints on public finances are “particularly severe.” “High and volatile interest rates make the situation worse,” he said.<h2>US debt looks riskier</h2>There are risks for the United States too. According to the IMF, investors are demanding higher returns to hold US Treasuries, reflecting their concerns over sustained inflation, the uncertain future path of monetary policy and additional debt issuance in the world’s biggest economy.“The risk premium on (US) government debt has increased in recent times and may remain high in a context in which debt levels are elevated,” the agency’s chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told reporters Tuesday.That means that even if the Fed cuts interest rates later this year — the IMF’s central scenario — US government funding costs may not fall by the same margin, he added.That would place further pressure on the government’s finances, leaving less money for public services or for absorbing future adverse shocks to the economy, such as financial meltdowns, pandemics or wars.The US government’s interest costs on a common measure soared to $659 billion in fiscal year 2023, which ended on September 30, according to the Treasury Department. That’s nearly double what it was in fiscal year 2020.And according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a non-profit, in fiscal year 2023, the government spent more to service its debt than it did on each of housing, transport and higher education.The IMF expects US public debt to continue rising, helping drive government debt worldwide to close to 100% of global gross domestic product by 2029, from 93% last year.The agency called on governments everywhere to exercise “fiscal restraint” in the world’s “biggest-ever election year.”“History shows governments tend to spend more and tax less during election years,” it said.",2024-04-17 12:19:00,America’s debt problem is storing up trouble for the rest of the world,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/17/economy/america-debt-interest-rates/index.html
"Chris Isidore,Natasha Chen","Disneyland employees who perform as many of the theme park’s beloved characters have filed to have a vote on whether to join the Actors’ Equity Association, which represents live performers all over the country, from actors on Broadway to strippers in Los Angeles.The group had announced a union organizing effort in February, but very often such campaigns fall short of filing to hold a vote. But the union announced Wednesday that it has filed cards signed by more than two-thirds of the 1,700 employees, seeking to have the National Labor Relations Board conduct an election.“The cast members who bring the characters and parades to life have been non-union since Disneyland Resort opened in the 1950s and have watched other workers in the park unionize all around them,” said Equity President Kate Shindle, using the “cast members” terms used at Disney to refer to its employees.Union organizing efforts have picked up in the last year, especially in the wake of a number of high-profile contract wins by unions that provided union members with large pay raises. Included in those wins were contracts covering 32,000 hourly workers at Disney World in Orlando, Florida, which gave them raises equal to $3 an hour by the end of last year and raises of about 37% over their previous hourly rate by 2026.There are more than 21,000 Disneyland “cast member” employees, who are represented by more than a dozen unions. Those unionized jobs include everything from retail and food service workers to security guards, hair and make-up artists and pyrotechnic workers. But it doesn’t include the performers who dress up as characters such as Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck or Goofy and interact with visitors. Workers performing in the same roles are unionized at some other Disney theme parks, such as Disney World.“These performers, and the hosts, leads and trainers who create magic alongside them, know that their lives — as well as the guest experience at Disneyland — can be improved through collective bargaining,” she said. “They deserve a voice in their workplace, and meaningful negotiations over wages, benefits and working conditions.”Disney did not have an immediate comment on the filing. But asked earlier in the week about the organizing campaign, a company spokesperson said: “We support our cast members’ right to a confidential vote that recognizes their individual choices.”<h2>Higher pay still not livable</h2>The perfomers in the proposed bargaining unit just saw their pay raised to $24.15 an hour from $20 an hour in January, a 20.8% raise. Those raises came after the organizing effort was already underway, even if it had not yet been publicly announced.But Disney’s labor market in the state is shifting, as California fast food workers just had their minimum wage increased to $20 an hour under state law, so the previous wage levels were likely no longer competitive.Several of the employees who spoke with CNN ahead of Wednesday’s announcement said that even the new higher pay level is still not a livable wage in Southern California, given that many of the workers work only part time.Mai Vo, who is what Disney calls a “look-alike” performer, someone who plays roles with her face showing, like Disney “Princesses,” is currently living at her mother’s home near Disneyland. Vo said it’s difficult for cast members to afford living on their own, and many have roommates.Zach Elefante, a parade performer, said many performers can lose paid hours if bad weather emerges, with decisions on cancellations often made with just minutes  before showtime.But Elefante took pains to say the workers are not fundamentally at odds with their employer.Elefante said they “want to be able to work with the resort to let people not be in fear of paying their rent because it started raining.”<h2>Safety concerns beyond pay</h2>Elefante and other Disney cast members say they have a deep, emotional connection to the shows they perform in, knowing that they get to make a story come to life in front of people young and old. Despite that, he said they feel disposable — and not listened to.Union supporters also speak about health and safety concerns, such as concerns about the designs of the heavy costumes many wear, and about interacting with the parks’ visitors in the wake of the pandemic.Vo said she remembers being troubled by a co-worker struggling for months with foot pain due to a costume’s shoes, which are often shared among employees.“Maybe things weren’t perfect at the Happiest Place on Earth, because it felt like my colleagues in the department were unhappy, and it didn’t make sense to me,” she said.Elefante also described two colleagues who raised issues with the ergonomics of a new, 120-pound costume, but were told there would be no changes. He said performers ended up performing in that costume for five or six years before the old version of the costume was brought back.But Elefante said that one of the main goals was simply for the people who work at Disneyland to have some semblance of influence on the Magic Kingdom.“There’s lots of perks that come along with [unionizing] and lots of benefits that people want to fight for. But if you got rid of all of that and only kept the fact that we are trying to have a voice at the table, that would be worth this entire process,” he said.Asked about the concerns raised by Elefante and Vo, a Disney spokesperson pointed to company policies that said schedule changes are based on the safety of visitors and employees, such as the case of inclement weather, and that no notice is required when that operational necessity is applied. She also said all cast members, whether or not they are represented by a union, have multiple methods to communicate safety concerns, including contacting park leadership, safety meetings, roundtables or using an anonymous hotline.But Elefante and Vo say they believe the majority of the group is ready to vote for the union due to their concerns. The two-thirds majority signing cards is not a guarantee the union will win a vote — support often decreases as management campaigns against the union in meetings with employees. But that level of support suggests it has a good chance of passing.Vo hopes that communication between employees and managers can improve, and that pay rates can increase. She said union representation would embody the same principles she espouses as her characters when talking to children in the parks.“Change can be scary. This whole thing is scary,” she said. “But if I’m brave enough and courageous enough to do it, I’m going to do it.”",2024-04-17 14:02:00,"Mickey, Minnie, Donald and Goofy file for union vote at Disneyland",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/17/business/disneyland-union-vote/index.html
Nicole Goodkind,"Investors in Trump Media & Technology Group’s stock finally saw an uptick in their shares after two days of turmoil.The stock TMTG (DJT) rebounded by 15.6% on Wednesday after tumbling precipitously earlier this week.Shares closed more than 14% lower on Tuesday after the company’s premier product, Truth Social, announced a major expansion into streaming, a notoriously cost-intensive business in which media behemoths like Disney have struggled to turn a profit. It also fell 18% on Monday after the company took steps to sell millions of extra shares.The company, which is majority-owned by former President Donald Trump, is down more than 60% from the all-time high it set on March 26, the day after it merged with a blank-check acquisition company to go public.The company’s market value as of Wednesday’s close was $3.6 billion, well below its peak of $8 billion when the company began trading at nearly $70 a share.<h2>The price of fame</h2>There are many reasons why Trump Media shares have been so volatile, including the fact that the company is inextricably linked to the former president. His name recognition, politically polarizing nature and close association with the company have captured the attention of retail investors, professional traders and the news media, creating a volatile environment for the stock.Although the company is still worth billions of dollars, it is struggling to make money and needs cash. Experts have warned investors to be careful if they choose to trade the stock, because the company doesn’t have the fundamentals to back up its sky-high valuation.Trump Media lost $58 million in 2023 and made just $4.1 million in revenue.<h2>Extreme turbulence</h2>Trump Media’s extreme peaks and troughs have caused wild swings in the net worth of the company’s largest shareholder and chairman: former President Donald Trump.On just one particularly bad day, Trump’s net worth plunged by $1 billion.Trump is currently in the midst of a criminal trial where he has been charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records for his alleged role in a hush money scheme before the 2016 election.

"Matt Egan,Ramishah Maruf","For nearly four hours, another Ivy League school president faced a congressional grilling over antisemitism on campus.Columbia University President Minouche Shafik tried to avoid the firestorm of controversy that pushed out two of the three university presidents who testified on Capitol Hill in December.Shafik, who was traveling during that last hearing, had the advantage of time to avoid some, though not all, of the landmines.Here are three takeaways from today’s hearing.<h2>Better preparations for some questions</h2>Shafik was better prepared for the question that tripped up the leaders of Harvard, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Pennsylvania in December: whether calls for the genocide of Jews violate university rules.While the other university presidents provided lawyerly answers that went viral, Shafik and her three Columbia colleagues all unequivocally stated that such calls would violate the code of conduct at Columbia.However, on some more specific issues, Shafik waffled and struggled to give clear answers, giving her critics considerable fodder along the way.For instance, the Columbia president was asked by Rep. Lisa McClain whether mobs shouting “from the river to the sea” or “long live the intifada” qualify as antisemitic comments.At first, Shafik said she finds such comments offensive.Pressed by McClain about whether these chants are antisemitic, Shafik said: “I hear them as such. Some people don’t.”Only after David Schizer, the co-chair of Columbia’s task force on antisemitism, indicated it would qualify as antisemitism did Shafik agree.<h2>Professors face consequences</h2>A similar situation played out when it comes to disciplining professors.“On my watch, for faculty who make remarks that cross the line in terms of antisemitism, there will be consequences,” Shafik said during the hearing.Shafik said tenured professor Joseph Massad, who called the October 7 attacks “awesome” in an online piece the next day, had been “spoken to” by members of his department.However, Shafik walked back her answer on his removal as chair of an academic committee though she did confirm he was under investigation for discriminatory remarks.“I do condemn his statement. I am appalled by what he said,” Shafik said in response to a question from Rep. Tim Walberg. “He has been spoken to.”In an emailed response to CNN, Massad said that his chairmanship of the commitee was simply coming to the end of the one-year appointment and that he was unaware of any probe prior to today’s hearing.Shafik said a professor who expressed support for Hamas on social media following October 7, Mohamed Abdou, is grading his students’ papers but will “never teach at Columbia again, and that will be on his permanent record.”And Shafik said one professor, Columbia Business School assistant professor Shai Davidai, is under investigation for harassment.Davidai called Shafik a “coward” in a fiery speech last year criticizing the university president for failing to quiet “pro-terror” voices at the school.The same professor has more than 50 complaints against him, Shafik said. Columbia University confirmed Davidai is under investigation.Davidai said to CNN that he has never spoken against students by name, only “pro-Hamas” student organizations and professors.“They’re investigating me for the entire reason this hearing was held in the first place. Columbia is investigating me for my social media tweets and only my social media tweets,” he said.Abdou did not immediately respond to a request for comment.<h2>More work is needed</h2>Of course, none of this is a trivial matter for Columbia students, including those who attended the hearing, chanted outside the hearing and spoke out during a press conference beforehand.One undergraduate student, Eden Yadegar, accused Columbia leaders during the press conference of sitting “idly by as a tsunami of antisemitism,” including harassment, intimidation and threats of physical violence, “flooded every aspect of campus life.”Shafik made clear during the hearing that Columbia officials “will not tolerate antisemitic threats, images and other violations.”However, Shafik acknowledged that Columbia officials have “much more work to do” as they seek to balance protecting free speech with ensuring all students feel safe.Contributing: CNN’s Elisabeth Buchwald.",2024-04-17 17:50:00,Three takeaways from the Columbia University president’s testimony on antisemitism,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/17/business/takeaways-columbia-antisemitism-hearing/index.html
"Marshall Cohen,Oliver Darcy","Voting technology company Smartmatic and the far-right network One America News said Tuesday that they had settled a defamation lawsuit stemming from the outlet’s lies about the 2020 election.“The case has been resolved pursuant to a confidential agreement,” OAN attorney Chip Babcock told CNN.Both parties declined to share details about the settlement.The case against OAN was one of a spate of lawsuits filed against right-wing outlets in the aftermath of the election. In the wake of the 2020 presidential contest, pro-Donald Trump outlets spread lies wrongfully suggesting President Joe Biden had not been legitimately elected president.Smartmatic filed its lawsuit against OAN in 2021, alleging that the right-wing conspiracy network “victimized” the company and spread lies about its role in the 2020 election to “increase viewership and revenue.”The development comes one year after Fox News reached a massive settlement with Dominion Voting Systems, another voting technology company that was similarly smeared in 2020. Fox News paid more than $787 million to end that lawsuit, becoming the largest publicly known defamation settlement in US history.Smartmatic still has pending lawsuit against Fox News, the smaller conservative channel Newsmax, and several pro-Trump figures who also pushed lies about the election.OAN has established itself as perhaps the most extreme of the pro-Trump cable news outlets. And its reporters have sometimes crossed the line into right-wing politicking.The little-watched network has regularly given airtime to baseless conspiracy theories that support Trump, most prominently about the 2020 election.The channel worked closely with Russian operatives on a propaganda-style documentary during Trump’s first impeachment in 2019 over allegations he pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. One of its correspondents, who is also an attorney, even worked with Trump’s legal team to subvert the 2020 election results.OAN settled a defamation suit in September with former Dominion executive Eric Coomer, whose case revealed how the network worked with former Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell and others to lie about the election.DirecTV dropped the far-right network from its lineup in 2022, dealing a significant blow to the outlet, hitting the network’s viewership and revenue.In its lawsuit, Smartmatic alleged OAN hosts and guests made dozens of false claims about the company’s role in the 2020 election. Personalities on the network repeatedly said Smartmatic software was used in voting machines “in 30 states,” including battleground states like Michigan and Pennsylvania. In reality, Smartmatic software was only used in one California county.Others on OAN claimed that Smartmatic’s software was “used to switch votes from President Trump to Joe Biden,” and said the company was engaged in digital “ballot-stuffing” to help Biden win. OAN personalities also stretched the truth about Smartmatic’s past ties to Venezuela to weave a baseless narrative that, “Maduro allies were meddling in the latest US election through a company called Smartmatic.”The case was still in the discovery phase when the settlement was reached.Depositions were scheduled to take place Tuesday, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The person said depositions were scheduled soon for OAN president Charles Herring and his brother Robert Herring Jr., who is also an OAN executive — but those won’t happen now that the case has concluded. Their father Robert Herring Sr., is a wealthy California businessman who founded the network in 2013.The Herrings were also entangled in a scandal within the lawsuit. Smartmatic claimed in court filings that they may have “engaged in criminal activities” by obtaining and sharing internal passwords of Smartmatic employees. OAN denied the allegations, and there was never a judicial finding of wrongdoing against the Herrings.While the Smartmatic case is over, OAN still faces a separate defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion over its promotion of 2020 election lies.Correction: This story has been updated to accurately state who had been scheduled for depositions in the Smartmatic-OAN case.

Oliver Darcy,"Uri Berliner, a National Public Radio senior editor who wrote a scathing online essay accusing the public radio network of harboring a liberal bias, said Wednesday he had resigned from the outlet.“I am resigning from NPR, a great American institution where I have worked for 25 years,” Berliner wrote in a resignation letter to NPR chief executive Katherine Maher, which he posted to his X account.An NPR spokesperson declined to comment.Berliner’s resignation came after he was suspended for five days without pay over his 3,500-word piece in the anti-establishment publication The Free Press. In the essay, Berliner claimed NPR had failed to properly cover allegations Donald Trump colluded with Russia in the runup to the 2016 election, the controversial Covid-19 lab-leak theory and New York Post’s story on Hunter Biden’s laptop.Berliner used his complaints about how those individual stories were covered by his colleagues to draw a sweeping conclusion that NPR had lost “viewpoint diversity,” and started “telling listeners how to think.”NPR editor-in-chief Edith Chapin quickly pushed back against Berliner’s characterization of the outlet, telling staff in a memo that network management “strongly disagree with Uri’s assessment of the quality of our journalism and the integrity of our newsroom processes.”“We believe that inclusion — among our staff, with our sourcing, and in our overall coverage — is critical to telling the nuanced stories of this country and our world,” she added.Other NPR staffers publicly rejected Berliner’s assessment in social media posts.In his resignation letter, Berliner said he did not support calls to defund NPR and that he wants to see the audio-focused outlet thrive. But he said he could not “work in a newsroom where I am disparaged by a new CEO whose divisive views confirm the very problems at NPR I cite in my Free Press.”Berliner was referencing a number of old tweets uncovered in recent days by right-wing activists in which Maher posted disparagingly about Trump.Isabel Lara, an NPR spokesperson, dismissed the attacks, saying Maher “was not working in journalism at the time and was exercising her First Amendment right to express herself like any other American citizen.”A day after Berliner penned his piece, the network found itself under siege as Donald Trump, Fox News and other right-wing figures held up his piece to demonize NPR and call for its defunding. Berliner’s allegations of network bias were billed as a top story, with right-wing outlets and personalities portraying Berliner as a “whistleblower.”",2024-04-17 12:52:00,NPR editor who penned scathing piece criticizing the public broadcaster resigns,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/17/media/npr-editor-resigns/index.html
"Chris Isidore,Gregory Wallace","Boeing’s already battered reputation took another hit at two Senate committee hearings Wednesday on Capitol Hill, with witnesses questioning how the company builds airplanes and the safety of those planes.One of the key witnesses was Boeing engineer Sam Salehpour, a whistleblower who said he’s been threatened for bringing safety concerns to his managers over several years, but that he was testifying due to his belief that “they are putting out defective airplanes.”“I have serious concerns about the safety of the 787 and 777 aircraft and I’m willing to take on professional risk to talk about them,” he said in his opening statement. He said when he raised concerns, “I was ignored. I was told not to create delays. I was told, frankly, to shut up.”He said that Boeing used “unmeasured and unlimited” amount of force – including people jumping on pieces of the airplane – to correct misalignment between sections of jets, and that the gap ended up being much more than the 5/1000th of an inch allowed by Boeing’s own standards.Boeing did not have any witnesses at either hearing Wednesday, but at a briefing earlier this week it defended the standards used to build planes. It said the 5/1000th of a inch gap is only the width of a human hair or two pieces of paper, and was a “hyper-conservative” standard. It said even when the gap is wider than what was originally proscribed, inspections of the jets showed no signs of fatigue or other problems even after years in service.But Salehpour said that Boeing’s assurances are invalid.“When operating at 35,000 feet, the size of a human hair can be a matter of life and death,” he said.“I have a very negative attitude toward the safety culture,” he said later in the hearing. “When I bring something to my boss, he prevents me from even documenting or sending information. When a quality manager says don’t send to a subject matter to an expert… that’s concerning.”Boeing put out a statement later in the day defending the safety of its planes, saying that the in 13 years of service, the 787 fleet has safely transported more than 850 million passengers on more than 4.2 million flight, while the 777 fleet has safely flown more than 3.9 billion passengers around the world.“Under FAA oversight, we have painstakingly inspected and reworked airplanes and improved production quality to meet exacting standards that are measured in the one hundredths of an inch,” said Boeing. “We are fully confident in the safety and durability of the 787 Dreamliner. We are fully confident in the safety of the 777, which remains the most successful widebody airplane family in aviation history.”Another witness, Ed Pierson, a former Boeing manager and the executive director of The Foundation for Aviation Safety, said the lack of paperwork that has been provided to National Transportation Safety Board investigators after a door plug blew out of a Boeing 737 Max flight by Alaska Airlines in January amounted to “a criminal cover-up.”“Records do exist documenting in detail the hectic work done on the Alaska Airlines airplane and Boeing’s corporate leaders know it too, because they fought to withhold these same damning records after the two Max crashes,” he said in his opening comments.But Boeing has yet to provide documentation to federal investigators of which employees worked on the door plug that blew off the Alaska Air flight due to it missing four bolts needed to hold the plug in place. Boeing recently said it has searched for records but believes its employees did not document the work.Senators on both sides of the aisle expressed concerns about the testimony.“This story is serious, even shocking,” said Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, the chairman of the Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations. “There are mounting, serious allegations that Boeing has a broken safety culture, and a set of practices that are unacceptable.”He said that since the hearing was announced, his committee has heard from other whistleblowers inside of Boeing. He said one mechanic from its nonunion South Carolina factory wrote that when he brought concerns, he was “told that hundreds of others were waiting outside the gates for our jobs.”“Boeing is at a moment of reckoning,” Blumenthal said. “It’s a moment many years in the making. It’s a moment that results not from one incident or one flight or one plane.”At its briefing on Monday ahead of the hearing Boeing said it has encouraged employees to bring forward safety concerns and since the Alaska air incident they have been doing so in much greater numbers.But ranking committee member Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said that while “we all want Boeing to succeed,” he said it is also important to hear from whistleblowers.“What I don’t want this committee to do is to scare the you-know-what out of the American public,” he said. “In the end I want the public to be confident getting on an airplane. But I have to admit, this testimony is more than troubling…We have to be concerned. We have to get to the bottom of this.”",2024-04-17 18:23:00,Boeing whistleblower: ‘They are putting out defective airplanes’,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/17/business/boeing-whistleblower-safety-hearing/index.html
