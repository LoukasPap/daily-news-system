# APIs
Implemented with FastAPI and using MongoDB as the database.

To run the server, create a virtual environment called 'api-venv' (name is for .gitignore purposes). After activating it, execute `pip install fastapi "uvicorn[standard]"` to install the necessary packages. Finally, run `uvicorn main:app --reload` to start the server.
